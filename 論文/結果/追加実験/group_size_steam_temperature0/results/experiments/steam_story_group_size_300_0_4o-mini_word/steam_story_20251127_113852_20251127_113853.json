      "Please, bare with me here...I NEVER write reviews for anything (this is probably the third review I have ever written), but I feel like I need to write this one for so many reasons!!!  I grew up playing the Telltale/Lucas Arts Series: Monkey Island. After discovering and playing those, I figured out that I have an infinite amount of love for Point and Click adventure games. After finishing that series, I really only played the other games made by either Lucas Arts or Telltale (Mostly because I thought they were the only creators of Point and Click games...until about a year ago, when I discovered there's an entire genre/world of Point and Click).  Of course, I must also note: The Curse of Monkey Island will always be my fav, as it was the first Point and Click I ever played. Ok...NOW...with all of that being said, I recently discovered WADJET EYE GAMES and I am SO happy I did. I would recommend EVERY.SINGLE,GAME they sell. I have played all of their MAC/iOS compatible Point and Clicks, and I have yet to be (even slightly) disappointed. I had very high expectations going in as the Monkey Island games, Day of the Tentacle, Full Throttle, Grim Fandago, etc. are some of the best games in the history of Point and Click; however, all of the games I have played from Wadjet Eye have been amazing. They have actually been so amazing that I can 100% say Wadjet Eye is at the top of my list, right there with the Telltale/Lucas Arts games. I 100% recommend purchasing and playing every game made by Wadjet Eye to anyone who likes (even those who kinda sorta like) Point and Click games.",
      "you're looking for a game review you've come to the wrong place. But if youre looking for a fantastic ravioli recipe you've come to the right place.\n\nIngredients\n- To Make the Dough\n375 grams (3 cups) plain flour\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n2 eggs\n1/4 cup (50 ml / 3½ tablespoons) olive oil\n1/2 cup (120 ml / 8 tablespoons) water\nExtra flour for dusting \n\n\n- To Make Cheese Filling\n15 ounces (425 grams) container Ricotta cheese\n5 ounces (142 g/about 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons) \"3 Cheese Italian Blend\" (Parmesan, Romano & Asiago)\nNote: grate these cheeses yourself and create your own custom blend.\n1/2 cup cheddar cheese\n2 eggs, lightly beaten\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/2 teaspoon pepper\n\n\n- Extras\nYour favorite sauce for the ravioli (i.e. marinara/ marijuana)\nParmesan cheese\nBasil\nFried vegetables\nShrimp\nFish slices\nChicken pieces \nMake the Ravioli filling.\n\n- In a small mixing bowl, add the ricotta and mash with a fork.\n- Add in the 3-cheese blend, Cheddar cheese, eggs, salt, and pepper.\n- Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth, paste-like consistency.\n- Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. \n\nMake the Ravioli dough.\n\n- Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.\n- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.\n- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.\n- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.\n- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.\n- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).\n- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. \n\nFill the Ravioli shells.\n\n- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.\n- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.\n- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.\n- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.\n- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. \n\nForm the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.\n\n- Roll the dough into two sheets\n- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.\n- Fill with the ravioli mixture.\n- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.\n- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.\n\nCook the Ravioli.\n\n- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.\n- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.\n- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest \n- Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed plates\n\nServe it up.\nTop with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!",
      "EDIT: they made putting easier!  I can finally shoot even and below on the first few courses.  Ignore my complaints about impossible putting below.  I'm back playing this again and enjoying it much more since the putting changes.\n\nI have a love/hate relationship with this game.  It's the closest thing to an enjoyable disc golf game on the PC that I've ever seen, and on that basis I recommend it.  Unlike most sports games, where I can play better on the computer than I can in real life, in this game that's not the case.  After six miserable hours of failure in this game I can safely promise you that I'm wildly better at real life disc golf than I ever will be with this game.\n\nPositives:\n\n- Discs mostly work the way they should (assuming you understand from IRL play how a particular disc should  behave depending on speed and throwing angle) though I feel like flight paths when you're throwing up or down in elevation are off sometimes, but if you throw a fast understable disc at too low a speed it will tail off into the left immediately and when you want to crank up and hyzer bomb the same disc at high speed it gives you the long S you expect and so forth\n- No bugs really (a couple of times the character model went wonky when a disc landed on/next to a rock wall)\n- Graphics are fine by me\n\nCons (possibly only for me, you may not suck at this):\n\n- The entire game is based on a \"stop the tick mark on a spot as it circles a ring\" type swing meter, and I'm absolute trash at it\n- Feels like no progress, other than buying discs--I've upgraded the three skill meters a lot and it has never felt like game play changed much (lol, it certainly hasn't gotten any easier!)\n- Putting is im-fucking-possible, at least for me, it's way too hard--putts that would be gimmes for a novice in real life are a crapshoot, especially if there's any elevation difference\n- After six hours I have only unlocked the first course and half of the second course . . . I may try to go back to this at some point, but for now I've given up on this sucker which is a shame--there are a bunch of other courses that I will never see (my fault, to be sure--I'm terrible at that stupid swing meter)\n\nI haven't played any better options, so while I'm probably giving up at six hours in I'd still recommend it to anyone who's into disc golf.  It's clearly too hard for me, but assuming you're not a complete klutz you will probably have better luck with it.",
      "Katana ZERO? More like, Katana ZERO CONCLUSION.\n\nI had too high expectation on this game, I thought it was going to be Hotline Miami but better.\nIn the end I still prefer Hotline Miami, specifically Hotline Miami 2.\n\nOne thing I dislike is the lack of combo scoring system. \nIt's a good way to make the players act fast and execute their actions flawlessly, instead the game only has a timer bar that never runs out as a way to motivate the player to go fast.\n\nI am aware how \"pointless\" game scores are.\nBut seeing a number going up feels good.\n\nWhat happens when you kill an enemy in Hotline Miami?\n - You get to see a number pops out, and the score goes up indicating that you are doing good!\n - Satisfying bloody hit sound.\n - Throbbing light on the edge of the map.\n - Randomized dead sprite of the enemy, sometimes they get dismembered depending on the weapon.\n\nIn Katana ZERO you'd get :\n - A \"fwoob\" sound.\n - A same dying animation of the enemy getting knocked and bleed to death. Instead of getting decapitated or something.\n - Flashy slash effect.\n\nAt one point I wondered on why should I even bother killing the enemies when it didn't reward me with anything in the room with a minecart. \nWhen having the enemy being killed by the minecart or the player makes no difference.\n\n[spoiler]More like Katana ZERO REWARD. I think this is it, exactly why I am disappointed by it. Imagine playing soulsbornekiro or Hollow Knight without earning any kind of currency??? Killing the enemies would feel pointless.[/spoiler]\n\nIt's basically way more fun and rewarding to kill an enemy in Hotline Miami than Katana ZERO.\n\nThen there are other stuff like...\nUnfun stealth gameplay. \nRollspamming without consequence.\nBeing able to endlessly doing a mid air attack without having to touch the ground first.\n\nThere are also waaaay too many checkpoints in my opinion, it encouraged me to just brute force everything with roll spamming without having to worry about starting over.\nThe rooms could've been a bit bigger and longer. But also less room, quality over quantity.\n\nAnd finally, the story.\nI was intrigued by it but it just ended abruptly with a \"To be continued\".\nIt's like they only wrote 50% of it then slapped a \"To be continued\" and called it a day.\nThe game seems to rely heavily on \"mentioning stuff off screen that player will never get to see\" to tease the player.\nI already knew that the game is going to be short, but I didn't expect it to be this disappointing. \n\nIt's not a bad game, I just had the wrong expectation.\n\nI might change it to positive if I was satisfied by the DLC.\nOr maybe after beating the hard mode, I heard it's more fun.",
      "EDIT: I nominated this game for game of the year (2023)\n\nLong ago I had heard about this game and how detailed and intricate it could be, and how you could spend hours upon hours building the massive empire of dwarves only for it to all come crashing down in some spectacular but unforeseen way.  Then I got into Rimworld briefly and thought it was ok, but it tended toward chaos a bit too much for my liking.  THEN I heard this game was coming to steam and I eagerly awaited it.\n\nIt's not necessarily that I was too good to play a game with mostly ascii/character graphics (I used to play them a lot back in the 1980s).  I was more intimidated by the depth of the game and not knowing if there was a wiki for it (there is) or how I'd find help if I needed it (I'm sure there's a ton of communities JUST for this game).  I expected that when it came to Steam, it'd be beefed up and worth the wait.\n\nWell it finally arrived and I think I'm STILL a bit intimidated by the sheer amount of options you have... mostly because it's not just me that I have to worry about, but a whole community of dwarves.  In the case of something like minecraft, I could dig a whole intricate tunnel and if stuff starts to go bad, I just high-tail it out of there and recover until I can go back and finish it.  In Dwarf Fortress though, if stuff starts to go bad, you can't just leave.  You are encouraged to deal with the adversity and push onward in the name of greatness... or something.\n\nIn a way it's like role playing, except you don't have to roll character sheets and you don't really control any of the characters directly.  You make decisions about where to mine, what trees to chop down, what to build, what to trade, what to plant, and for every thing there is a season (turn turn turn).  You're forced to deal with death, birth, attacks, sickness, madness, and a ton of other things that I have no idea are coming.  \n\nI keep thinking \"I could do better\" and I start a new game, but then I start to realize that no matter what I do, I'm never gonna have a perfect game, or a game where everything goes exactly according to plan.  I am eventually going to have to buckle down and stick to one game save to see it through.\n\nIf you're like me and starting something new holds a lot more interest than continuing an existing project (ADHD?) you may have difficulty with this game.  At the same time you may become so engrossed in it that you lose track of time and suddenly it's 6am and you wonder why you stayed up all night digging holes.  I'm starting to feel a bit of the madness myself.  (it's almost 4:30am as I write this)\n\nIn any case, it's probably not for everyone, but I'd say if you're unsure, find the non-steam version and try that, and if you can grok what's going on and it interests you, definitely buy this and support the developers... OR buy this and try to stay under the 2 hour refund  limit while you learn the basics (Good luck with that, it'll be 6 hours before you know what happened).  I believe this game is worth the money though (full price).  If you were going to wait for a sale you'd be waiting a long time anyway.  \n\nTL;DR If this looks interesting to you, don't wait! Buy now.  If you aren't sure, do a bit of research and come back and buy it.",
      "Incomphrehesible UI, sloppy controls.\n\n\nGranted I'm a day one player, but very steep learning curve. Couldn't figure out interstellar nav, for the life of me, and the touchy controls made the dogfighting a chore. Save your money. This isn't a jump in and play game.",
      "An interesting experience for RPGMaker vidya enthusiasts.\n\nBefore you pick up this title, be sure to download and play the demo, as the demo is the (free) first episode of the series, this game being the second episode.\n\nA Psychological Thriller, as stated in the description, is probably the best way to describe this series, an adventure through bizzare yet oddly pretty settings.\n\nThe first episode is quite a fun, humorous adventure, but still manages to be gripping and gut-wrenching in some areas. Difficult for me to describe in words, but it's free, so there's no reason not to play it.\n\nThe second episode strays from the fun, humorous side of things and focuses more on story, an unexpected yet completely welcome change of tone. If you enjoyed the first and got to like the characters, the second episode is well worth the price.\n\nFeel free to pick it up if it seems interesting to you.",
      "[i]Welcome to MY Fantasy Zone[/i]\n\nPeople may look at Bayonetta’s design and dismiss it as something not worthy of their time, but the truth is that they are making disservice to themselves. Under the veil of constant innuendos, silly sexual posing, and pole dancing is the absolute peak of what the spectacle fighter genre has to offer, and the game delivers it [i]with style.[/i]\n\nBayonetta obviously does not take itself seriously. This absolute lack of consideration for the common sense eventually hurts the game’s story fragments which become more incomprehensible the more you look into them, but you are not here for the stupid story, right? You are here to kick some serious ass in this visceral antithesis of DOOM, where instead of gunning down hell spawn as masculine badass, you end up spanking heavenly messengers as no-less-badass lady… using her magical hair to do so. Other common scenes include: suplexing a giant angelic dragon, fighting on top of a fired war-missile, playing volleyball with set of huge demonic hands, or accidentally ending all the possible debates between astronomers in topic of Pluto being a planet (this one unfortunately will score you a Game Over screen so keep this in mind as a tip). The point is that Platinum delivers a game of stupidly and unapologetically over the top action that doesn't stop being awesome throughout its whole run.\n\nI’m also impressed with how deep the gameplay mechanics can go despite looking deceptively simple. This ties to the difficulty level of the game which is a tad too high when selecting Normal for the first time. You will miss important dodges, misjudge enemy attack cues, mash buttons instead of comboing, and your general understanding of the game will not be enough to scrape above the lowest skill ratings. Enemies get tougher and tougher and you will end up dying pretty often, all while still having jolly good fun, which in the end is really impressive. I will recommend to try the New Game+ mode after finishing the game, but still setting the difficulty to Normal. You will see yourself improving significantly and discovering more interesting tricks up Bayonetta’s sleeve. All of it is a very satisfying process that shows developers’ design forte and ensures the replayability.\n\nBattle system is the game’s biggest part and there aren’t that many more important gameplay mechanics to speak of. There is some basic exploration here and there, which is decent, and a few minigames played out throughout the campaign which are also adding up to the pile of positives I have for the game. Aside for the story and locations being copy-pasted between chapters quite often, I cannot really find any more faults that require special mention. There are the graphics which are a little aged all things considered, and the PC port that, while being quite good, has some minor quirks. Summarizing, there is nothing wrong that an [i]absolutely sexy[/i] soundtrack cannot fix with its joyful and jazzy tunes and impressive choral themes for the angelic enemies.\n\nYou like action games? Then shut up, buy a lollipop and sensually lick it while playing Bayonetta. You definitely will be looking stupid in the process, but on the brighter side of this flight to the moon – you will experience one of the best, if not THE BEST, games from the action genre.",
      "I love this game. In fact, I've loved it since I was in highschool about 8 years ago. My friend and I used to play this game together all the time on my flashdrive. We were always discussing & trying to understand the ins-&-outs of the game and how to get a specific ending depending on what you did. Playing this brought me back to those good times in that library.\n\nThe OSTs are nostalgic, the gameplay is about the same and the artwork is amazing as ever(actually the graphics are much better with this remake).\nThe only complaint I have is that it lags at random times(though usually in the menu). The original IB on RPGMaker never did that.\nOverall I'm glad I bought this so I could support the Dev and thank them for all those years of entertainment-\nI just wish there wasn't so much lag over an RPGMaker game.",
      "Honestly I've put over 400 hours into 20XX and this game is even better! Even though it's unfinished as of current it's still a fantastic time and truly stands out on it's own.",
      "Before I start this review, I want to make something clear. This comes from a place not of hatred, but of love. Destiny is a game near and dear to my heart and it angers me to see the way Bungie has handled it. I know they can do better.\nI've played the Destiny series since year 1, Destiny 1. I've been through its highs, its lows, and everything inbetween this game I love. I've seen content droughts, content surges, content drops and flops. I've seen this game rise... and fall.\nIt's time I faced facts, I stop huffing Copium, and be truthful; despite being with this game for years, I genuinely can't recommend it to anybody. Not in the state the game is right now. This isn't just another user complaining about a there not being new content to play constantly without any droughts, but as a player genuinely concerned for the direction Bungie is taking the game, the way the past and recent DLC have been handled, how they've monetized this game, and how they've treated their veteran playerbase.\nI bought the $100 Special Edition back when this game first released. All that content I bought with my hard earned money. Within a year $100 worth of content turned free to play. $100 for me turned into $0 for the average player within one year. I received no compensation for buying the game so early except an Emblem. An emblem. Not a potential for a free season pass when the seasons first started, no refund for my money, nothing. Where is this content now? Gone. Not a piece of it is still in the game. My compensation for this content leaving? Nothing still.\nForsaken, the best DLC they've released for this game. The DLC that brought D2 from being a shitshow to being a great, relevant game with a good story tacked on it? Wiped from this game's code.\nThe game may be \"Free to play\" but you'll sink hundreds of dollars for DLC, seasonal passes, and now separate dungeon passes worth as much as your average season pass. It's too much money to ask for people that Bungie can and will wipe from the game's code in a few months time.\nYes, the content they do bring is fun, but drip-feeding us the same content for months without any relevant changes is just not a fun game to play. What is there to do anyways? We have:\nRaids, high quality but the same ones every time\nStrikes, fun but repetitive after years of getting so little new ones\nDungeons, similar problems to the above, fun but repetitive from lack of variety\nSeasonal content, not worth doing anything but the current season unless you're trying to follow up with the game story\nCrucible with a shitty tryhard meta and hardly any new maps\nGambit, a gamemode they've basically given up on with maps they've removed from the pool\nSeasonal events, fun but the same damn thing every season\nNone of these feel fresh after years and years of doing the same ones and watching old favorites get sunset from the game.\nAnd it's not like Bungie can't look back at D1 for inspiration; Sparrow Racing League is something players have been clamoring for, it'd be something fresh that Bungie can use to entice players to stay in the game. Bungie has gone on record stating that \"by the time they've designed an SRL map for Destiny 2, they could have made several strikes maps\" which to me states that A: they aren't willing to put in the effort for player experience and B: aren't willing to make several strike maps worth of content at once.\nAnd getting new players into Destiny? The most painful experience I've tried to do. This game's onboarding experience is horrible, mismanaged, and held back by half the content being locked behind a paywall. From friends I've tried to get into the game, the new player experience is:\nOverwhelming\nConfusing\nNo sense of clear direction\nAll the cool stuff is locked behind paid dlc\nWhy was I put into this random mission when I booted up the game (seasonal mission you start with at every season)\nAny many more comments that made them not want to play the game.\n\nI know this review was basically a rant about how I feel this game is going with no clear rime or reason, jumping from topic to topic, but I just want to see this game thrive the way I know it can. Because Bungie has shown to be a competent company with quality products, but I'm just not seeing that right now.\nAnd i also want compensation for the $100 I watched vanish in the span of a year.",
      "I played the demo and instantly became enamored. The mix of Slay the Spire-style deck-building with elements of the ship combat from FTL: Faster Than Light is an absolutely fascinating mix, and the \"single-axis\" movement system adds a whole extra layer that I've never seen in anything except the Mega Man: Battle Network series.\n\nI bought the full game within the first hour of being available. After having played for nearly 4 hours at the time of writing, my opinion hasn't changed in the slightest. I already love what's available and so far I feel like I've barely scratched the surface.\n\nI can't wait to see what awaits in the future for this awesome title.\n\nEDIT: As a small addition, I will say: I beat my very first run, which is set to the lowest difficulty (Normal). I jumped up to Hard to try to unlock a new ship, and I haven't been able to beat a run since then. It's probably just that I'm bad, all things considered, but be aware that the changes made with difficulty increases are probably more impactful than they may seem.\n\nAlso I wanna say to the devs: thank you for launching the game with mod support and working on making it easier! But also please look into getting Steam Workshop support if you can!",
      "Don't believe the hype.\n\nAbsolutely limited appeal and not Rouge-Lite/Like, shouldn't even be remotely labelled as such. Cult management and the building of your cult is very rudimentary and a massive missed opportunity. No strategy or tactics in combat (little to no variation in creatures) and ultra repetitive. Little to no option and interaction with followers of any substance besides the simple 101's. \n\nSo many better options out there (cheaper as well) that can offer you more and robust challenge (rim world, for eg).\n\nIf you must purchase, only do so at a extremely discounted rate. You'll regret it otherwise.\n\nCute graphics will only get you so far.\n\nDon't believe the hype.",
      "I would give this a mixed rating if I could. \nThe story is told in such a boring way that it's hard to stay invested. You run to one person, listen to a cutscene, or more likely read a cutscene, than go to another person to talk to. Sometimes you fight one guy but mostly it's pretty dull. There is very little gameplay in the overland content and everything plays like a bad visual novel.\n\nAAR, the first MSQ is just one fetch quest after the other with little story in it. Oh there is some story there, but it's not great. The characters are shallow with few expectations, both the supporting cast and villains. \n\nHeavensward, the expansion I got through before my time ran out, is better than ARR but not that enjoyable. There were parts I like (not to give spoilers, it was the part where you go on a “journey”) Sadly, that part of the expansion was far too short. Than the story precedes to shove itself up it’s own ass as it becomes fixated on one part of the lore. [spoiler]I don’t give a damn how the war started! It was a thousand years ago.[/spoiler]\nPro:\n-If you like story, and only story, you will like this game.\n-A lot of content\n-Trial fights. (Good boss fights without the boring part of dungeons)\n\nCons:\n-Little in the way of gameplay outside of dungeons and trials \n-ARR is a slog and not worth reading. Skip as fast as you can and just watch a recap video.\n-dungeons are locked behind the story and not unlocked as you level up.\n-The story is on the lower end of other final fantasy games.\n-Lalafells are in the game. People who play this race are degenerates.",
      "Simply fantastic. Probably the best TRUE RPG I've ever played. Your choices matter, dialogue options matter, the order in which you do things matter, even such small things such as the items you hold in your hand matter. Every build is viable, go heavy in Physical stats and you'll have difficulty solving things Logically, but maybe you can brute force your way through something. Go heavy in Logic and you'll be weak in a one-to-one fight, but maybe you'll be so fast to figure things out that it'll never come to that. You'll see things that the dim-witted brute with high Physical didn't. Failure is encouraged, there are many routes in the game you cannot open without failing something else first.\n\nA true combat system does not exist. At all. Physical altercations are decided through dice rolls based on how you've built your character. And virtually all of them are optional. I like this decision a lot. I've always found it immersion-breaking in RPGs when you're just running around the countryside, killing every bandit or animal that comes your way. This one keeps fights realistic with REAL consequences depending how things go.\n\nBarring having to restart my game once due to a bug (quicksave often, autosaves are few), the game had no major technical issues. There was a single point in the game where a vital skill check required a specific skill to be built, and I'm not sure if there were any alternate routes. I couldn't find any, just had to savescum the check. Aside from that, you have options as to how to approach everything. I'm not sure if that was an oversight or if I just missed something.\n\nCan't go into the story much without spoilers (and you DON'T want it spoiled, it's great.) But it's very well-written and even hilarious at some points. But don't be fooled, it's not a comedy game. It tackles very serious topics such as Fascism, Communism, Mental Illness, Addiction, and many other things.\n\nOverall an amazing RPG experience that I cannot recommend enough. Will definitely play through this several times to see how things go with different builds. Highly suggest you purchase this if you have any interest.",
      "Red Matter 2 sets a new bar for VR mystery/suspense/story based games. I've thought about reaching out to the developer and thanking them it's that good. If you're a space lover like me, DON'T MISS THIS! Some very memorable moments in this, and the graphics are even better than Alyx sometimes. The music also is well done. Just enough to give you some atmosphere, but not overdone. If you also played the original this is worth getting for a continuation of the original story too. Very little is re-hashed so you've got to pay some attention to succeed. This also gets fairly creepy, more than the original, so if you're averse to horror games, this may not be for you. All in all, as I just finished this days ago, I'm still fairly blown away at how good it was. The developer has really found their niche. Still getting chills from the ending of this.",
      "I would say that [i]Pyre[/i] is a rather underrated gem from [i]Supergiants[/i], although it has very positive reviews on Steam. I believe that many players missed an important info about [i]Pyre[/i]. It's a visual novel in the first place, heavily concentrated on lore, characters and story. The action in sports like battles is just a secondary element. I was also surprised by it being a visual novel, but I wasn't disappointed. Right on the contrary. I have fallen in love.\n\nThis game is very complex and everything in it has its purpose. There is a meaning to how the story unfolds, what exact information you learn, what characters you meet… maybe you won't be able to see it during your first playthrough, but the end should make it clear and eventually all the other playthroughs… because there is still a lot to see and I will come back many times for sure.\n\nI don't want to spoil you the story, because it's truly amazing and filled with plot twists which always force me to change my plan… I can say that we get exiled to the Downside, a horrid place without any means of returning, meant for the worst criminals, delinquents and offenders of the Commonwealth. There, on wide empty plains, we are found lost, alone and almost broken by a trio of other exiles, each one of them different in species, size, personality and with different motivation in their hearts. They make us an offer, because there is a way out of this place, although it's not commonly known… not that we can exactly decline as that would mean our, probably quick, demise in the Downside wilderness. We accept and offer them our skills then, namely reading as it was banned a long time ago in the Commonwealth, because only the Reader can uncover the secrets hidden in [i]the Book of Rite[/i]s… book that holds the information on how can one obtain their freedom… and even something more.\nWe board their old wagon, which had seen better times a lifetime ago, and following the stars we set on an adventure looking for other suitable exiles to be able to unite and to fight for a better future not just for us, but for all the others.\n\n[i]Rites[/i] are the action parts of the game. I would describe it as a mix of basketball and American football. There are three players on each side, the main goal is to grab a ball and toss it into enemy fire. Winner is the one who extinguishes the opponent's fire first. Fights are short, fast paced and if you are not careful you can lose in a blink of an eye (especially on a harder difficulty). As you progress through the story you recruit new characters into your “squad\", each have a different cast of abilities and more importantly also behave completely differently on the field. You are always given an opportunity to try them out, but it can be a challenge to master them properly. The ones who participate in the fight gain enlightenment (a lot of experience), those who are on the bench gain inspiration (next time they participate in the fight they level up faster). And here comes the catch. The ultimate goal is to get free, but only one can leave this place once he is deemed worthy and [b]you[/b] are going to choose which one it is, from the three most enlightened. [b]You[/b] will send away one of your exiles, never to return. So the one you play most with, your best one will be gone and you [b]have[/b] to play with the others… never forget that.\nThis concept adds another level of immersion, because you are now torn apart by the choice waiting for you. Will you allow them freedom or will you deny it? But you and your crew aren't the only one seeking their freedom, there are others you have to fight with and yet again they all have different desires and motivations to go back. Nothing is easy and maybe sacrificing your own freedom to offer them chance for their own may be the stars will.\n\nThe cast of the characters you meet in the game is big and pretty diverse. Their personalities are excellently portrayed and all of them are very much likable, some of them have written deeply into my heart. There is no standard voice acting as no one is speaking in English, except for [i]The Voice[/i] (tiptop Logan Cunningham), instead they have an \"extra new\" language. And they only speak in short lines, few words, sights… but that's all you need. It's so amazing, it fits the characters so much. I wouldn't want it any other way. You can also open info about all of the characters in the game, learn about their past… and in the end even about their future.\n\nIn addition to a great story and characters we have bright, vivid, colorful graphics full of tiny details, it's a joy to look at. Next thing that is creating a great fitting atmosphere throughout the whole game is the soundtrack, which is exceptional! Darren Korb is truly ingenious. His music is full of emotions and perfectly captures every situation and character. I really like the soundtrack in [i]Alan Wake[/i], especially the songs which tell the story plot, I have found it very clever. Darren Korb, and the [i]Supergiants[/i], simply brought it to perfection, because their storytelling songs bring me goosebumps every time I hear them.\n\nAs is usual with other [i]Supergiants[/i] games each character has a skill challenge, which will grant you artifact designed right for them. You can also make fights harder by enabling disadvantages against yourself in the form of better stats for your adversaries and worse stats for your triumvirate. After completing the main story you can test your skills against others in multiplayer or just against a CPU, that's also fun.\n\nI can wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who loves great compelling stories with beautiful visuals and soundtrack; you won't be disappointed. Be prepared that you are going to read, do not skip or rush through it, the story is the important thing, not the action.\nThere is only one thing I find unsatisfactory about the game - I would love to be able to romance one of the characters. ^^",

      "SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT.\n\nAs the store page states, NOREN is supposedly a 'simple' keyfinding game. That would be true if there were any keys actually in the game, but as it stands it seems that NOREN is a simple abandoned shovelware game that's impossible to progress in, let alone beat. You play as some soldier in a massive, dark castle, equipped only with a dying lantern. The light fades quickly, and you can regain light slowly by... standing by a light source. That'd be simple enough if you weren't endlessly pursued by dinosaurs that are programmed with AI which knows your exact location at all times; three chomps and you're 'aparted' from the world, where you respawn with whatever amount of light and sanity you have left. Additionally, the translation attempt is abysmal at best. \n\nBoth NOREN and its developer, ThroneLab, should be banned from Steam. I do not blow the 'scam' whistle lightly, and I only do such when I am 100% certain of something actually being a scam. There are a handful of videos of this title on YouTube as well, with only one being over 5 minutes long. No one found a key.

      "I hated Undertale.\n\nIt was, pretty clearly, a game about sexy skeletons. I did not care about sexy skeletons. I refused to play a game about sexy skeletons.\n\nThen my friend made me listen to the soundtrack, and I decided I could deal with a few hours of sexy skeletons if I got to listen to the best video game music I had ever heard while doing it. \n\nI played Undertale. It's not a game about sexy skeletons. It's a game about choices, maybe, or morality, or curiosity. It's a game about pushing the limits. It's a game about experiences, about \"what would happen if I did this?\", about storytelling so intricate and complex and raw that it shouldn't be able to fit into seven hours of bullet hell and pixel graphics. But, somehow, it does. Every choice you make has an impact. Every object you check has a story. The soundtrack, the witty yet profound writing, the simple pixel graphics, and even the menu screens and bullet patterns themselves all intertwine in order to tell a story that only you decide the ending of.\n\nAlso, the skeletons aren't even sexy.\n\nMy advice to you: Go in as blind as you can. Don't read walkthroughs. Don't watch playthroughs. Don't prepare yourself. Don't even look at overviews. Hell, don't even read the Steam page description. Just buy the game (and give some well-earned money to a little white dog), and, as it were, climb the mountain yourself. Don't let anyone backseat. Don't listen to people who tell you there's a right way to play.\n\nAnd when you think you've reached the end, just think--what other choices could you have made?\n\nSo, yes.

      "This one of the best first person shooter games I've ever played, plain and simple.\n\nHalf Life 2 begins 20 years after the original Half Life. As Gordon Freeman awakens from stasis he finds himself on a train heading to City 17 which is overrun by the combine. You find yourself as the leader of the resistance and you must take down the Combine. \n\nHalf Life 2 is at this point one of the best received games and I'm sure pretty much everyone has played it. If not well what the hell are you doing reading this review ? You need to go buy this game straight away and play it right now.\n\nThe game is a simple first person shooter, but it does plenty things different than the regular first person shooters. You have a health bar and you have to do platforming to solve some of the puzzles.  Not to mention the source engine physics are absolutely insane. \n\nFor a game that came out back in 2004 it still looks amazing. Now while it does have so low res textures it's still looks breath taking, like in the final chapters.\n\nThe game for the most part is pretty easy. I played through the game without a problem, even though some segments were tough due to the fast movement you have to pull off to avoid gunfire. Not to mention the Strider battles are incredibly intense and quite difficult.\n\nThe game took me 10 hours to finish. I felt this was the perfect amount of time for the price I paid for it and this was worth every single penny.\n\nApart from the single playthrough there's not much replay value. The only reason to replay it twice is to look for the G-Man Easter eggs. \n\nIn the end Half Life 2 is a fantastic game. It's a must own for everyone who is a gamer. This game is a piece of history and without a doubt one of the best games I have ever played in my entire life.\n\nI experienced zero problems while playing the game. I ran the game on ultra settings 60 FPS the entire time of playing. This game runs really well and should run on pretty much all systems.\n\nFinal Rating:\n9.5/10 -  A Must own and must play\n\nIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments what you disliked about the review.\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/snortsreviews#curation]here[/url] - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!",

      "I've loved this game, put in WAY more hours making maps and modded content for it than I have playing it which is a terrifying statistic to think about, and have made some of the closest friendships from playing with people in the community- but, I'm just really disheartened. This is gonna be a long post, I've nolifed the shit out of this game for the better part of half a decade so there's a bit.\n\nHaving people come into my streams & DMs to ask me if I'm going to be porting my map and mods over to ARK1.5 with ASA and then to ARK2 before all of this immense drama and fleecing happened, before we knew anything about prices and release dates- it was a firm yes! I'd love to bring my creations over to UE5, porting content over was so easy, even myself and people in the modding community were putting our maps and creations into stock UE5 just to see what the possibilities were and get off on the new physics, lumen and nanite.\n\nNow I really don't want to bring that content over. Not only because of the bad business practice, with many other games who have ported over to UE5 or have done engine upgrades been offered for free- but because I've seen this one too many times with this company and the business is just horrifically mismanaged and it's heartbreaking for some of us, it's heartbreaking for me.\n\nWhen someone in a position of power and authority over an IP and business has stated that ARK1.5 would be free, as a gesture of good faith, you take that as a promise, and we were all stoked about that. That was the right thing to do. ARK is not a small indie, unknown survival game in a (mostly) unfinished state anymore like it was- it is a powerhouse in the industry, top survival game charts across the internet for -years- will have ARK in the top 5- it is not a game that has done poorly for revenue, publicity or players. It is one of the giants. The best IP that Snail/WC have to date and continues to be. There is no reason to renege on a promise that was publicly made. And before some moron says \"JuSt DoNt BuY It ThEn\" it's deeper than that, I would have had, at my hours invested, zero issues purchasing ARK1.5 for like $20-$30 bucks with all DLC's included- but to make an offer, after it was promised as free, then to take it back and serve up an even bigger steaming pile of shit that is more expensive on a plate, and for Wildcard to hand you the spoon and be like yum yum dig in! Is so strange.\n\nHonestly, I'm not surprised. I was a public moderator in the ATLAS discord with Jat and other off branched former/current- Wildcard/Grapeshot employees at the release of that absolute dumpsterfire and was there with the rest trying to put out fires that could be witnessed from fu**g Jupiter- because I had faith and volunteered my time to assist with a company I believed in, created for and wanted to succeed so badly for the community. \n\nDark and Light was next. Another abandoned IP. Then Last Oasis- yep- Abandoned. All of the offbranches of ARK have failed so horribly, and haven't managed to capture that excitement that ARK did for the industry but they will absolutely keep trying to push out what they think consumers will like, all without listening to any feedback- and feedback isn't always good, do not get it twisted some suggestions I've seen truly are horrendous- but there are gems in amongst the boulders and landslides. Having the initiative to sift and find them, and then really look at them seems to be the problem. It concerns me deeply when Wildcard state themselves on their newsletters that ARK2 will be such a different experience from ARK1 that it now makes sense why they tried to package it in a non-refundable-at-time-of-play bundle with ARK1.5.\n\nSpeaking from experience here- the best thing Wildcard/Snail have done for ARK, and I will never discredit them for it, is their Sponsored Mods program and hiring modders from the community for ARK and ATLAS. That alone has kept ARK where it is, as popular as it is, as fresh as it is and as revolutionary as it is. There is never a drought of \"content\" with ARK, as the modding community carries it on their backs each and every day. Official servers have their place, and I disagree with how they're being handled, but have no solution for that as I never was an official player for more than an hour at a time to remind me why I prefer modded servers. This is no discredit to the ARK art department, by the way, having looked through the maps in the Devkit- Aberration is still to this day is a visual and technical marvel, and many other maps made since then.\n\nThere is a massive air of uncertainty for modders with ARK1.5 and 2. Logistically, the average number of mods on big unofficial servers is about 18- if each modder listing them on Overwolf decides to list their single mod for say $3 bucks, something very reasonable- times that by 18 and are players really going to be expected to play on a single server they MIGHT not even like, for $54 bucks? Maybe they discovered that server was good but had no players during their playtime- and then they find one in their region but, oh- there's 5 more mods on this server, there's another $15 to play on this one. Is a $69(nice) investment really worth it? I don't think so. Even at what has been discussed quietly behind closed doors with other modders at a $1 a mod price, so 50c to the modder, 50c to Overwolf/Wildcard- that's still, on average, $18 bucks to play on a server- this price is not including ARK1.5, or the DLCs for it- so what was the discussed \"Content creators/Modders can make a living!\" price...? Because when you take a step back from the buzzwords, there's a colossal black hole of a problem in the logistics.\n\nI digress, without any more information to go on regarding priced mods, we can only speculate. Back to what we know. \n\nSelling all DLCs and base game for ARK 1 that will functionally become a single player story mode and mod carried game without any warnings, notices or heads up to new prospective players is scummy as hell. There will absolutely be more delays before ARK 1.5, which will extend the lifecycle of the current game and DLCs, sure, but it's shady. The idea that ARK1 will become, in a sense, a showcase of my above statement about modders carrying the entire ARK community on their backs, and a solo story is fine- but adjust your listings so that people will know they will never experience ARK1 as \"Wilcard intended\" with the removal of official servers, that they will be playing with archived mods no longer receiving updates as many modders move over to 1.5, that they will have a limited playerbase to play with as most have gone to 1.5, that there is limited updates going to be provided due to 1.5- that there is no more official DLC... due to 1.5.\n\nThis isn't even taking into their account their roadmap of the supposed finished content releases for ARK1.5 and ARK2 finishing up and starting at almost the exact same time. So we will have this problem ALL over again when the release of ARK2 is imminent, after it's delays. Players who bought ARK1.5 and all the DLC's will play on that for a month or two before ARK2 is released, then ARK1 is even more abandoned, and ARK1.5 will dwindle.\n\nI know many people will say- damn, this chick gives way too much of a shit about this game, you right lol. I don't like seeing a community be lied to, deceived, fleeced and taken advantage of. ARK is one of those \"coping\" games. If you spend any time with the community, it's a comfort. People come home from work or school and they will turn their brain off and just play. For hours. Not giving any thoughts to how shit their workday was, how badly they were bullied at school, how much anxiety they have or problems they are facing- ARK lets them turn off and have fun, it's an escape game. There's not many other games out there that keep people playing like ARK does, for so many reasons. But, the community is at the core of it.\n\nI wish Wildcard would pay attention to it.",
      "Very fun game if you are looking for a cozy relaxing farming sim. if you had a hard time with the fishing mechanic in stardew valley then you will have an easier time with this game, ontop of that there are lots of cute little rhythm games to play and the animal raising is alot more in depth then stardew. just a little note of warning to new players, the game doesn't make this very clear but you shouldn't spend too much time gardening in your first year. Automatic watering systems aren't available until later on and if you are like me you will think making the biggest profit possible year one is a great idea but I accidentally ended up upgrading/unlocking everything except irrigation in my first year and now do not have much to spend my currency on. Other then finishing catching every fish, maybe decorating my farm/the village and getting the rare coloured animals theres not much else to do in the game for late game content. It feels like there is the intention of possibly adding more content later on? either way if you decide to play, for your first play through I really recommend exploring first and getting to know the villagers before you start large scale farming.",
      "This game surprised me in how good it was. I had heard about it, like everyone, and also like a lot of people I had dismissed it as a watered-down Dark Souls clone with a Star Wars skin, and let it collect dust in my Steam collection.\n\nI was wrong. The game's combat is tight and polished, just the right difficulty on Normal. The movement, the general game feel, is superb. The game has a competent story with excellent characterizations, character arcs, dialogue, exposition, world-building, and pacing.  The music feels like top-shelf Star Wars without being a lazy copypasta of John Williams's score (though you'll hear sprinklings of familiar motifs throughout, of course). \n\nThere are collectibles (they are all cosmetics), but it's a tasteful, reasonable amount of them, and they are distributed in a way that feels fun instead of like a chore, and you're never pressured into collecting them with menus or reminders; they are entirely optional in both a technical and a psychological sense. I actually found it fun to collect new appearances in order to play dress-up \"Fashion Souls\". \n\nThere are bosses, and they are challenging but not frustrating. Definitely easier than Dark Souls's harder bosses like Ornstein or Artorias, but still tricky enough that it feels rewarding to overcome them.\n\nIf I had to describe this game in two words, it would be \"just right\". There is just the right amount of each little element that it feels fun, never tedious, never like a grind. I'm a jaded old man who has seen it all and who is not easy to entertain, and I found this game extremely refreshing. If you read this review during the sale where it's only 3.99 USD, get it immediately.",
      "I'm going to write an honest review for this game since A LOT of people seem to be very biased.\n\nThis is not a perfect game. No 2K basketball game will ever be a perfect game. Does that mean this game is bad? No. Should you hold off on the game for now? Probably.\n\nLet's start with the positives:\n\n- A lot of people seem to gloss over the fact that 2K rehauled a lot of mechanics for this game. Shot meters feel more legitimate, this game is MUCH much more realistic (fouls, shot tendencies, etc...) This game is better and more fluid to control, and the gameplay reflects each players' ratings (defense, shots, etc...) much more accurately.\n\n- Online play seems to be better and more fluid. I've yet to encounter any latency issues online with quick play and the such.\n\n- MyCareer is MUCH better than last years. There is no cheesy story and the cutscenes feel much more integrated into the game. Orange Juice and dynamic duos are a great idea in general. The UI for MyCareer (and the game in general) is so much cleaner and more functional.\n\n- The game is visually beautiful, not much else to say on the matter.\n\nNow, the cons:\n\n- Help defense is broken. It's quite ridiculous that 2K hasn't fixes this lingering issue in such a long time but it's still there. This is a BIG issue in MyCareer and not quite as bad in other modes since you can manually control players.\n\n- Stat allocation is broken. This is a huge issue in MyCareer and has deterred me from playing the mode any more until 2K fixes this issue. Introducing the idea of stats that can only be raised in practice is actually quite a neat idea. However, these boosts are not permanent, even though 2K has stated they are. This is detrimental and demoralizing and discourages players from playing the game more. Limit caps are ridiculously strict as well. 2K NEEDS to fix these issues ASAP.\n\n- Numerous glitches.\n\n- 2K introduced broken mechanics along with the good mechanics. Ankle breakers are now pathetically easy to pull off (using Stephen Curry behind the back moves is a surefire way to have your defender fall). Moving screens are now a thing. \n\nI would hold off on buying this game until 2K patches it. There are just too many issues with the game that prevent it from being a playable game. I like this game. I really do. That's why I'm hoping 2K listens to the community and starts working on the issues at hand immediately.",

      "Steam keeps on bothering me to write a review for this game so here's one , i guess.\n\nYou might have heard this ' there's nothing like it on the market ' description of Hunt : Showdown and frankly i must admit that it is mostly spot on. This game is pretty unique and intriguing mix of PVE and PVP within setting which i frankly doubt i ever really saw used in a video game before. We are talking about end of 19th century Louisiana  mixed with paranormal horror activity.\n\nIf you would take a super brief look at Hunt's gameplay loop one could mistakenly assume that it is a battle royal game and while there are few similarities between the two, Hunt has a really original and unique gameplay loop i have never seen done before in a video game.\n\nCore idea here is that you enter a map , which is 1km x 1km square , either alone , in a duo or a trio of hunters and your main goal is to look for clues to locate a boss , kill him , banish him and extract with a bounty. Sounds simple enough , right? But that is there fun actually behinds. Besides having to contend with PVE part of the game , that is various kind of AI controlled zombies ( for the lack of better word ) , number of sound traps like injured animals ,crows ,caged chickens and dogs ( of whom all make loud noises then disturbed in turn giving out your location and even direction you are moving in ) , you are also not alone in a pursuit of that bounty. That is there PVP part of game kicks in .\n\nEven  though this is  PVPVE game , PVE is here only to slow down you rather than being a real threat. Real threat comes from other players who also have same goal as you. Real 'meat' of this game is PVP and while you can choose and avoid PVP all together , you will not have much fun while doing so. Bosses , again , are mostly there to funnel players into the same area to initiate PVP fights.\n\nPVP is rough and tough in Hunt. From what i understand earlier in it's life it was even more hardcore , but even at it's current state this game is not for faint hearted folks. Kill times are low , weapons are mostly single shots so each shot counts ( fitting the settings and time period ) and while on a surface this could look like a simple point and shoot situation there are dozens upon dozens of systems and things to consider in each firefight so you will need tens and in some cases hundreds of hours to really start to feel what are you doing. \n\n I wont lie to you , for first 20 or 30 hours i was pretty much cowering behind stuff in each firefights in essence being a glorified decoy for enemy players while my team mate hopefully was doing something less useless.  Hunt can be really stressful with steep learning curve, perma death ( losing your hunter with all his/her equipment you spent so much money on ) and never knowing who has your in their scopes while crossing open fields but it also can be so very rewarding when you survive a final server wide gunfight on your last bullet and out of healing items. Even 140 hours in some of the firefights leaves me with my heart pounding which is a rare occasion after playing video games and FPS game for more than 25 years now.\n\nThere are of course bunch of technical issues, questionable decisions from the dev team and other negatives associated with any competitive online game so be aware of that before you decide to enter Bayou .",

      "Okay so first and foremost the reason why I'm giving this a thumbs up is simple. The game does what it set out to do perfectly. Because of that I have no complaints about it's style.\n\nHOWEVER.\n\nI personally do not like the game. It is my own personal hangup. But I can understand why other people will enjoy it.\n\nThe game is fast paced, level by level FPS with challenges. Almost every single one of them is timed if not all of them are timed. It's similar to Doom or Killing Floor. Only there are no cusomizations implemented at time of play. \n\nThe game is challenging and offers you many different faucets on those challenges. It has different gun types for different enemies, different strategies and all of them complicated and challenging. But that's the point right?\n\nRegardless, the game was pretty fun and if you're looking for a level by level challenge system set to a similar style of Doom then you might just enjoy this game.\n\nIf this wasn't enough for you then please check out the video on my YouTube Channel for a more precise in depth explanation (link below).\n\nThanks for reading and I hope I helped some of you out there to spend your money wisely.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXiok7bhPdY",
      "I like furry art, but first and foremost im a RPG gamer, and as such I will rend judgment impartially. \n\nThe story is not bad, but still falls in the average category and it is predictable, gameplay is the same as the first Fuga (I have no problems there) but there are few new enemies,  so the strategy to beat the regular battles is very repetitive. My biggest complain remains the same since Tail Concerto and it is the dificulty... which is way too easy, there is no hard / nightmare mode for veteran players, Im not asking to die repeatedly like in dark souls but Cyberconnect2 needs to understand some players like a challenge in their games.\n\nMusic is ok and Hack is the best character of the lot (Tah tah tah tah  taaah!!!!!) I would play Fuga 3 just for him.\n\nIt pains me to give the thumbs down, but Cyberconnect2 needs to work a little harder.",

      "EDIT:\n\nWhile I have played Squad quite a bit for a few years, the large update named \"V6.0 Infantry Combat Overhaul\" unfortunately did not sit well with me.\n\nThe goals for the update:\n\n- Increase length of fights.\n- Reduce the impact of lone wolfs (solo players).\n- Increase emphasis on teamwork mechanics, which mainly meant supression.\n- Increase gunplay diversity, to create choices between optics, since the old meta meant that the magnified optics were greatly outperforming iron sights and holo sights.\n\nWhile I do not disagree with some of the goals, the implementation of them left a lot to be desired.\n\nAfter the update most gunfights became a mess of supression, without either side being able to effetively kill each other beyond 200m.\nGunhandling was also drastically nerfed, creating the sense that your character has never held a rifle before, or even used an optic for that matter.\n\nI can unfortunately no longer recommend this game, since I myself no longer feel drawn to play it.\n\nIf enough changes are made, I may revisit the game and this review, but for now there are better options out there.\n\n\n** OLD REVIEW ** \n\nCan the game be amazing and fun - yes! Do I recommend this for everyone? - No.\n\nThe experience of the game largely depends on what servers / communities you play with. If you play the core game with no moderation (no rules or admins), the game will become a race to make the first unit and lock others out and a race to get armor, then proceed to rush the enemy and end up spawnkilling them near their main spawn.\n\nIf you play on moderated servers with established rules and active admins, then you may experience a great sense of teamplay - other times not so much.\n\nBefore you buy it though...\n\n- Microphone and willingness to use it is REQUIRED for a good experience (People will quickly kick or become hostile towards you, if you do not communicate)\n- This is not battlefield or call of duty, running of solo to pull off 360 noscopes will probably get you kicked/ killed.\n- You will die without knowing from where and you will get into situations in which you have no option to survive, especially if you're new to tactical shooters.\n- You will end up running... A lot..\n- Armor is not like battlefield or call of duty, you need a driver, gunner, commander and possibly a loader (has a machinegun). Where you hit the enemy matters as much as what you hit him with (Armor piercing on his front turret will likely bounce, but even a high explosive may hurt if you can hit him up the rear)\n\nStill here... ?\n\nIf I haven't scared you off, here are my personal tips:\n- Play. The. Tutorial.  Like really...\n- Try different graphic settings, shadows especially makes a big difference in enemy visibility (game looks better with them though)\n- Start as infantry and pick rifleman, but remember to join a squad.\n- Find a server that seems to have active admins and have a ruleset you agree with.\n- Try NOT to give up when you die, generally it isn't worth throwing away a ticket to respawn if you have friendlies within 100m. Sometimes it is the right choice, but before you know which is which, it's a good idea to hold on for a medic.\n- Not all squad leaders know what they're doing, do not be afraid to join another squad if it turns out your squad leader is a fool.\n- Defending is often as important (if not more), than attacking... But you may end up waiting 30 minutes without getting shot at or shooting anyone.\n\n\nAs you can probably tell... Squad is a community based game, with in-depth enough mechanics, while also being easily accessable.\nIf you want a good sense of what the game is, check out some lesser known streamer playing it (bigger streamers will often give you the wrong sense of what a game is like)\n\nHope this helped you make an informed decision.\n\nbut for now there are better options out there.",
      "Having currently 1340 hours of playtime and having reached the highest achievable rank (Grand Champion), I can't currently recommend others to follow what I've been doing.\n\nWhile I love the game for it's smooth gameplay and somewhat balanced roster of playable character, the company, Stunlock Studios, are simply not caring for this game the way it deserves. In the start of 2018 we got a roadmap of promised features. This roadmap has since been tossed aside, and the community mocked, as they left battlerite arena development for months to do a battleroyale gamemode, which then turned into a standalone game, which then flopped and as of now has around 1/10 of the active playerbase that Battlerite has.\n\nAs others have also said, the matchmaking is horrible, especially at higher ranks. This can probably be attributed to the low playercount. At the highest ranks, it would not be uncommon to have a queue of 10-15 minutes only to be matched against people at a significantly lower skill level, which then leaves everyone in the match unhappy. This is in Europe, which I believe is the region with the highest playercount.\n\nTo sum it up, I believe this was a game with great potential, which has been wasted by a company with 40 employees, somehow only doing updates like they were a company of 3 people.",

Stylistically and comedy wise anyway. The story is much darker than anything in Earthbound, but it's all buried underneath some of the funniest writing I've ever seen in a game. The writing start to finish is amazing, I'm only dissappointed that the game wasn't longer as there's a few questions left unanswered.\n\nI did normal mode, first run, collected all characters and beat the game in 12-13 hours. For 10 dollars, that's pretty alright. The fights are pretty open ended as there are like 20+ characters you can choose from, but I ended up using Rage, Bottles and Mad Dog. I found it wasn't the hardest game I've played, but I also haven't tried pain mode yet.\n\nAnyway, if this game interests you at all, buy it. You won't regret it.",
      "I just finished Metro 2033 Redux a while ago, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. One of the best things is that the game is COMPLETELY in a first person perspective, including the cutscenes. Reminded me of Bioshock Infinite a bit in that respect. You are fully immersed in your world. Except for the ending though..for some reason they chose to do a zoomed out pre-rendered cutscene there. \n\nI played on Survival mode (normal difficulty) and the challenge was decent. At one or two points in the game, it wasn't clear to me what to do (probably wasn't paying attention to the dialogues), but I like the no-hand-holding thing. At the last level as well, I ended up running out of filters (pretty sure I scoured all around for supplies and hit the limit many times) so that kinda took away from the experience a bit. \n\nBut otherwise, the story was good. Decent enemy variation. Stealth is possible against humans as well (game doesn't explicitly tell you this IIRC). Just make sure you crouch all the time and turn off your flashlight!\n\nCombat was great as well. The weapon handling felt really good. I found a quad-barrel shotgun and that was massive. Killed all Watchmen in a single shot! \n\nAtmosphere was realistic and well done. Performance was great as well on my humble GTX 750 (with medium settings). \n\nIt's hard for me to find fault with the game. I went in with little expectation, but then again I also don't play much FPS games. This is definitely better gameplay wise than Bioshock Infinite and Spec Ops: The Line though.",

This is by far the best Assassin's Creed.\n\nFirst of all, the naval combat is intuitive and really fluid and satisfying. The combat is the same \"Press B to counter\", but the addition of guns and darts do make things more interesting.\n\nWhile most of the time you are at sea \"pirating\", the sections on land are also really good. While the tailing and eavesdropping sessions are frustrating at times and boring at others, the free running is more fluid than ever, with realistic animations and few obstacles that can stop you.\n\nThe story is interesting and does encourage you to play all the main missions. However, there is a huge variety of side missions that can be played as soon as you get your ship to sail the enormous maps, where many ships sail and where whales swim.\n\nI have not played a lot of the multiplayer because I don't find it that interesting and varied.\n\nOverall, this is the best AC game so far: improved gameplay, lenghty and fun, it only makes me more pumped for Assassin's Creed Unity.\n\nSCORE: 90/100",

      "Minutes ago, this reviewer completed the game Gorogoa. And now, an attempt will be made to describe the experience. It won’t be easy…….\n\nIn 1968 this player went to the theatre to see a brand-new movie: 2001: A Space Odyssey. What crossed the screen wasn’t so much a story in the filmmaking sense., but rather an experience. Views of Earth from space (before such images existed IRL), and a final scene that perhaps no one understood, but clearly was meaningful beyond simply the ability, or need, for words to express. Gorogoa left this player with a very similar feeling of inexplicable fulfillment.\n\nGorogoa might be described as a puzzle game, but certainly not in any typical sense. More accurately, Gorogoa is a game about travel, but traversing distance in more ways than just spatially. It’s about travel within, and travel to places unknown (perhaps outside of dreams.) It’s about traveling through space, time, life (and lives), and travel through the experience that is mankind. And perhaps more, it’s about the journey necessary for each player to experience in order to be able to complete the experience that is Gorogoa.\n\nGorogoa provides very little information or assistance, beyond the option for hints about the areas of each image that need be considered for game progress. (It’s difficult to imagine a first-time player succeeding without such hints, so no stigma should be associated with them, especially if they prevent the need for outside resources as may well be the case.) Almost nothing more can be said without compromising some aspect of this game, so this review will be brief, and likely almost as mysterious as the game itself. Learning the goal is as much a puzzle as is the process of reaching that goal. Images are moved, shrunk, expanded, combined, variously manipulated…….ENOUGH! \n\nPlay, and learn about possibilities unimagined until now. In a single word…genius.\n\nThank you.\n\n(As with most Steam games, offline game time is not tracked.)",

I never really heard too much about it or even payed to much attention to it; back in my childhood I remember seeing it around the internet but it never really talked to me.\nSo a few years back I bought the whole HL franchise here on Steam, already acquainted with the game's praise. \n\nAfter a couple of failed attempts to play HL2, but getting stuck on the same part, I finally got to finish the game. \nAnd I must say I'm totally on board with all the praise and status!\n\n\n[h1]PLOT:[/h1]\n\nThe story continues after the events of Half-Life 1, where Gordon Freeman, a scientist working on the Black Mesa Research Facility, fights his way through hords of aliens brought to Earth by a portal that Gordon himself opened.\n\nWe wake-up to a dystopian future where the Black Mesa and the alien infestation led to a very different world of ours, where humans live in a opressing society on the likes of the book \"1984\", where everyone is meticulously controlled by the \"system\".\nThis hugely different and creative setting really talked to me and even made me more interested in the narrative.\n\nFrom then on, Freeman tries to lead a group of \"resistence\" fighters to oppose and tear down the ruller of Earth, the former administrator of the Black Mesa Facility, Wallace Breen, (whom also \"negotiated\" a peace agreement with the aliens, right after the events of HL1).\n\nI must say this story is a very creative and different experience of those found in other FPS games.\nI always found myself on the edge of my seat, eager to know what was gonna happen next, and while also amazed by all the environmental storytelling.\nIt's truly one of the game's strongest points and even though your character doesn't speak, you will find yourself completely imersed on the narrative. Even all these years after, this political and social matter that Valve went for and explored is one of the game's strongest points really!\n\nAnd not to forget about all of those fantabulous and explosive setpieces seen throughtout the game that are really solid and entretaining, having inspired other games like Uncharted and the Call of Duty campaigns, just to say a few. You are really put in some tricky and tough situations.\n\n\n[h1]GAMEPLAY:[/h1]\n\nThis is your average FPS gameplay. Nothing you haven't seen before, but HL2 is certainly a gold standard of how to excell and give variety in your gameplay.\n\nYou've got your normal 2000's arsenal, like Pistols, the series' signature weapon the Crowbar, a Revolver that packs a serious punch, an SMG, Assault Rifle, Shotgun (THAT FEELS SO GOOD TO SHOOT), Grenades, Crossbow, Rocket Laucher and a new \"toy gun\" the Gravity Gun.\n\nAt the time, Valve was developing a new physics engine never seen before that went on to shake and revolutionize games at the time, but in order to really make usage of this new technology, [u]the developers of Half-Life 2 introduced the Gravity Gun to the weapons roster [/u]. \nWith it you can \"grab\" multiple objects, such as crates, file cabinets, gasoline tanks or even buzzsaw blades to throw at oponents. It's a very creative way to make usage of the different environment assets while showing off new technology.\nIt's also another tool to help you get out of sticky situations like puzzles, something that Half Life 2 really experiments with. \nWith this engine, Valve pushed the physics to bring different puzzles that just feel natural to solve.\n\nGameplay feels really natural and it's what we have grown accostumed to in the FPS genre, but very competent and polished.\n[spoiler](the shotgun just feels awesome and sooooo satisfying to shoot)[/spoiler]\n\n\n[h1]SOUND AND MUSIC:[/h1]\n\nSound feels like a very big step-up comparing to Half-Life 1 and every weapon sound much better when firing.\n\nEnvironmental sound is really good and pushes you even more to the game's immersion. Every area of the game is masterfully design, to the sewer sections that feel so claustrophobic and tense to walk through, to the more city like big places where you can sense the real sense of scale of the space through the sound design. \n\nI must say it's really top notch.\n\nBut there were times where I felt that the sound mixing was a little off, having sounds playing with a really pumped up volume that really distracted me and put me off.\n\nIn the other hand, the Music is just amazing. It's 00's techno and rock like music that just injects you with such adrenaline and makes you feel really awesome with gunning down opponest. VERY SATIFYING INDEED.\n\n\n[h1]GRAPHICS:[/h1]\n\nIn all honesty this is a hard category to judge, because obviously the graphics are going to look a bit dated to what we have today (in 2020), but honestly everything look really good.\n\nFrom characters and enemies, to the environments, to the fire and explosion effects, it all looks very good and has a great level of quality to them. Specially the alien creatures. I felt utterly disturbed by those \"facehuggers\" like creatures. Everytime they jumped at my face I would equally jump, but of my seat with disgust... \n\n\n[h1]CONCLUSION:[/h1]\n\n[b]To summ it up, I think that Half-Life 2 is a must play game. \n\nReally, if you are like me and you have heard about it, but was like \"meh maybe this game is old and dated and its now crap\", just cut the argument and go play a really good and polished experience.\n\nFor those out there, if you want a polished and strong game that still challenges most contemporary games, with an interesting narrative, and some awesome moments just grab yourself a copy of this. It's dirt cheap, no excuses...[/b]",
      "Let's say you capture a prisoner after a bloody raid on your colony. Do you want to:\n\n1. Let them go in the hopes of improving relations with the attackers? YOU CAN DO THAT.\n\n2. Heal them and have colonists talk to them about how great your colony is until they join? YOU CAN DO THAT.\n\n3. Have a colonist with a high medical skill remove their liver to transplant into an alcoholic colonist? YOU CAN DO THAT.\n\n4. Have a colonist with a low medical skill remove their organs just for practice? YOU CAN DO THAT.\n\n5. Eat them because you forgot to stock up on food for the winter? YOU CAN DO THAT.\n\nReally, what else do you need in a game?",
      "First steps:\n-set nioh.exe and nioh_launcher.exe to win7 compatibility (if you experience crashes).\n-first level (London) is poorly optimized, so better rush through it and judge the next.\n-experience this game as Nioh and not as a \"Souls\" game, tho I draw comparisons here\n\n\n[h1]Good[/h1]\n\nCombat\nBy far the best thing about the game. You get 7 weapon classes + 3 ranged weapons, and each of the 7 weapons has it's own unique skillset accompanied by 3 different stances. On the fly switching between 3 stances and 2 weapons, or even both at the same time allows for a ton of combinations to chain different attacks and combos. On top of all that you get magic, spirit guardians and ninjutsu. Sky is the limit if you're willing to experiment.\n\n\nBosses\nThe game comes with roughly over 30 unique bossfights, some of them will reappear or be demoted to regular enemies over the course of the game. There are only very few bosses I didn't like. Most of them are going to be human, but that doesn't mean they are boring. Most have sick movesets that make them very engaging and fun to fight, especially the DLC bosses. \n\n\nDifficulty\nJust like Dark Souls the game is as difficult as you want it to be. This means you get alot of tools that allow you to cheese the game. Like summons, or certain character builds centered around spirit guadians and op magic like sloth talisman which makes enemies move in slow motion. \nThe difficulty curve is a falling one, aka the game is more difficult in the begining when you're figuering things out, then it remains on a steady level with occasional spikes upwards. Disregarding bs like sloth talisman I would say the game is overall more difficult than Dark Souls. Combat is faster and mistakes are punished severly, even human fodder enemies can 1-shot you if you happen to take swings when they are in heavy stance.\n\n\nStory\nIt's decent, but nothing special. Nerds interested in the sengoku period to early edo period \nwill probably appreciate the characters and their interactions.\n\n\nWorld\nIt's not an interconnected world like DS1. It is mission based where you pick main or side missions from a map, personally I don't mind the \"arcade\" style. Main missions themself are big levels with multiple shortcuts that loop back to shrines (bonfires). Those levels are bigger than most designated areas in DS3, my guess is like 1.5x-2x the size. If I had to rank the level design... DS1 >>>> DS3 > Nioh >>>>>>> DS2 \n\n\nReplayability\nThe game offers 4 NG difficulties which spice things up by switching enemy placements or giving enemies (and bosses) status effects and new moves. Other than that you get Abyss mode which is most comparable to DMC's bloody palace. \n\n\nMultiplayer/Netcode + pseudo PvP\n3 ways to play mutiplayer: as summon/summoner, co-op missions where both players make progress at the same time and PvP (which is dead).  The Netcode worked quite well for me, even over wide distances like brazil-germany. I never had to adjust for delay and could parry attacks just like offline.  The netcode is quite good imo compared to DS3 where I did lots of co-op at Champion Gundyr and parrying was totally out of the question.\n\n\nThe other \"pvp mode\" is the faction/clan system. You get multiple clans that belong to 1 of the 2 factions. A clan gives you 2 passive buffs that can compliment your playstyle. You obtain glory by killing revenants, succesfull co-op or pvp for your clan. The more glory you obtain, the higher the rank of your faction, clan and yourself. Glory acts as another currency and can be used to buy npc skins, gestures or items.\n\n\nFashion Souls\nLike the look of a particular light armor set but hate getting insta killed by radroaches? No problem, at the blacksmith you can transform any weapon skin or piece of armor, and keep the stats of your preferred equipment. If you get tired of playing as William you can buy npc skins for glory at the teahouse (unlocks at roughly 33% of the game) which is the only way to play as a female as there is no character creation.\n\n[h1]Bad[/h1]\n\nEnemy Variaty\nThe games biggest weakness in my opinion.  Enemy \"species\" come in different flavours, e.g. humans can wield any of the 7 weapons, however this doesn't realy trigger the visual stimulation of seeing something new. Saving grace: the game throws you into different 1vsX situations, so the combination of enemies keeps things interesting, kinda like DMC4 which also has wack enemy variety. I think they could've done much more in terms of creativity when it comes to the yokai/oni realm given the huge amount of lore.\n\n\nRepetition\nSide missions take place in mostly the same batch of areas or in parts of main missions. \nThey try to keep things fresh by switching enemies and spawn points. But they still feel kinda tedious because skipping them isn't realy an option as you can't deny yourself the experience, rewards and loot.\n\n\nMusic\nGood but gets repetitive as only few themes are shared across bosses.\n\n\nFunky Optimization\nSelf explainatory. FPS tanks in London and I had random crashes. The later were solved by the tips mentioned at the top of the review.\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nI found the combat mechanics to be more than able to compensate for the games weaknesses (repetition, enemy variety). This means you've to take up responsibility and be creative yourself. If you're the type who doesn't like experimenting and spends 90% of his time with spear in mid stance, and plays like its DS (dodge > R1 > R1 > dodge > R1 > dodge...), then you're gonna get bored quickly. Although, I've seen those guys during co-op all the way up to NG3-4, so who knows... .",
      "Ok to make it short.\n\n- Poor graphics (like 10 years old PC game)\nBUT nothing more to complain about.\n\n- great atmosphere, great story, very good fighting mechanics. Of course great price.\n\nIf you have nothing against japan style - just play the game. One of funniest games in some years for me.",
      "For a company as big as Amazon, this game is extremely sub par. It feels as though it's in Early Access and some of the recent patch notes are very worrying for the game's future\n\nPros:\n- Stunning gfx. Especially for an MMO, the lighting in particular is amazing\n- Sound track is great and ambience adds personality to the zones\n- Some really cool zones to explore, feels as though you can get lost when you start\n- Controls/Keybinds are already really good imo, I only changed a few\n- Tutorial/Starter Quest chains do a great job of introducing you to the game without being too slow\n- Combat (when it works) Is really fun. Lots of action based fights\n- Wars are a really cool mechanic, they are ultimately flawed but are still a lot of fun\n\nCons:\n- Game is extremely shallow. It is borderline addicting for the first few levels, this soon dies off. When (If) You reach lvl 60, you ask yourself what do you do now?\n- As beautiful as the game is, a lot of it is copy and pasted. Literally. There are zones, towns, dungeons that are almost identical. Ruins immersion\n- Quests are extremely repetitive and boring. They consist of kill mobs, loot mobs, loot chests and that’s about it. No diversity\n- Combat can be laggy, you weapon swap and it doesn’t register sometimes. Wars can be a PowerPoint Presentation at times\n- Guild UI is awful. There is no guild bank, treasury ledger so you cannot monitor who donates money for wars etc. Makes running a guild a nightmare\n- There are countless exploits and duplications that have been abused upsetting economies, player numbers and the general integrity of the game\n- Server population has been decimated since launch leading to many dead servers. They’re merging already\n- There are some very worrying patch notes/future releases that are changing fundamental mechanics of the game. In some cases nerfs which punish players who didn’t rush to level cap\n- Watermark is a stupid progression system for gear. It forces you to run daily elite zone farm chains which get extremely repetitive\n\nIf this was a small indie dev company, I could give them the benefit of the doubt. However this is frickin’ Amazon. This product is totally unacceptable and needs to go back in the oven.\n",
      "IMHO this game is highly over-hyped, glad I only spend a few € and bought it at sale.\n\n- Basic concept of dungeon crawling with horror is copied from D&D Ravenloft or Call of Cuthullu. So nothing new here. \n- Story is simple and stereotypical: Old man evokes some unnamed horror in a cursed mansion that curses the land...  \n- Graphics are nicely painted ... but still painted, so outdated concept. It's a indy game, ok ... and maybe some gamers still love playing games on their 386er personal computers from 1990 ...\n- The gameplay itself is IMHO stale, because it's always the same: go into a dungeon. Fight. Grind. Survive.\n- Stress could be an interesting factor, but not in the way it is implemented. In its current form is nothing but a second health bar, which is either difficult or expensive to heal. It makes the game not more complex or more interesting but only more frustrating. Stress could be interesting, if it had different stages with different effects. But in its current form and the difficulty of the game itself it is simply idiotic to take stressed heroes into battle. \n- Random number generator is bad. Really bad. Maybe intentional bad? Who knows...?\n\nThe game itself is grind, more grind, and … grind. Combined with the lame story and the frustration it is a game for masochists and people that want to become one.",
      "I've been playing this game since it was in Kickstarter! It is the best Story Rich game that I have ever played and the most unique. I have played through maybe 7 times and it's different every time. The ability to replay this game countless times is what makes it such a great game. Tons of questions that change based on the questions you've asked, you see a question that might not be there after you ask another question instead. Every version of this game that I played kept my interest and had me sitting on the edge of my seat waiting for more. I have reached 2 endings so far and I can't wait to see what happens next. The Developers are great, I can't wait to see what they create next.",
      "I play 100+ puzzle games every year and this is likely my favourite release of 2020.\n\nDraknek and his team have truly advanced the state of the art in how the game's world is put together and how exploration and puzzle-solving are interconnected. There is no other puzzle game that does quite what this one does in terms of the interaction between mechanics design, navigation, and secret-finding. It's not just a game about pushing and rolling cylinders around, it's a game about really interesting cause-and-effect relationships between the cylinders, the spaces they're placed in, and the places that you wanna get to but can't.\n\nIf you're a serious puzzle gamer, don't be put off by the game's pastel appearance and the choice of marketing and press quotes that emphasize the soothing or cozy nature of the gameplay. The game's content, including the low-difficulty puzzles, are still very interesting even if you're an experienced puzzle-solver. \n\nThe approachability of the game is achieved by having an \"easy path\" through most of the areas. In this case, easy does not mean \"uninteresting\", but instead means \"interesting puzzles that are rigged so that low-skill solvers are highly likely to stumble upon the solution\". If you're a veteran puzzle-solver, you may not even realize this. It's quite clever. The puzzles off the \"easy path\" are quite challenging (some mind-bogglingly so) and many are incredible feats of design that you will not want to miss.\n\nThe art, sound, and writing are competently executed, and the controls, audio, and visuals do not get in the way of the puzzle-solving. The narrative is entirely flavourtext and is completely irrelevant to the puzzle content, so you can ignore it if you don't care for it (but some of it is hilarious).\n\nThere is one \"thing I wish I knew before I started playing\", and this is that if you want to find all the secrets, you should first rush to complete to the game (get to the credits) before spending a lot of time trying to find secrets. Trying to 100% each area individually during your first playthrough will lead to a lot of frustration and wasted time.\n\nThis game is wonderful. I hope Drak makes an expansion/sequel with another 500+ islands. There are enough unused tricks and unexplored design space here that he could easily fill it (but adding 3x1 logs might also be fun).",
      "This is the best Civilization up to this point, and the DLC just made it even better. I will grant that the with all the add ons it would feel a tad crowded to anyone who hadn't played it before, but you have a crazy amount of options. The game series tagline of \"one more turn\" could not be more applicable.\n\nYou can strive for one of several victories: diplomatic, cultural, technological or domination. Each has its unique challengers to overcome and create a lot of the fun of the game. They are also not necessarily mutually exclusive and after completing one victory, you can go for the others. Each AI opponent has their own personality, and are pretty predictable in how they behave. Any one who has started the game next to Neopoleon or Ghengis Kahn knows they immediately have to have a decent military to repel invasion, while Ghandi will to muscle you out with religion and culture.\n\nThere are some important changes between Civilization IV and V. One of the most notable is that wars are plausible again as you dont constantly lose health in enemy territory and cities are easier to conquer. Additionally, culture doesn't automatically take over neighbor's cities anymore. \n\nThis game is easily worth the money. I'm not entirely sure how it stacks up to Civilization VI, but any game that I log 200+ hours on over a period of years and still haven't come close to doing everything is doing something right. A great game from a great series.",
      "Homeworld is typically known as the very first 3D RTS -- despite this distinguishing trait, it's not very popular. It's rather obscure, which I find odd for a game that was made with so much love and detail. The story of the two Homeworld campaigns is very nice, the aesthetic of the game is excellent in my opinion, but when it comes to the multiplayer, in vanilla 2.1 Homeworld, the current version, you will face severe balancing issues between the races.\nFortunately, the community has come up with a solution, one that took a lot of time and effort to be. Thanks to them, the multiplayer is now playable with the patch that they made -- the 2.3 players patch. It's still being updated and is worked on by people who understand the overall concept of the game and the genre it belongs to.\nIt's available to everyone in the workshop and is in my opinion (and a lot of others's) the best way to experience both multiplayer and the game itself.",

      "This is the fighting game that you give to a friend who doesn't play fighting games to learn, the Steam Edition of Killer Instinct comes with all of the characters as well as the extra premium skins that were added into the game. Killer Instinct has arguably one of the best tutorial systems that I have played with in recent years, if not one of the best period. It allows you to learn at a reasonable pace each and every one of the specific features of the game, including assists so that people are able to learn what combo breaker they need to use versus specific attacks. Combo Assist in this is less a crutch or a hand hold mechanic and more of a guide when it comes to using combos, it will automatically add in linkers to combos so that people who are unfamiliar with the game aren't left mashing buttons and making a fool of themselves because they don't know what they are doing, it will free flow the fight as best as it can to help guide people toward what they need to be doing, showing off what specials people could be doing to link the combo together and maximize the amount of damage they could possibly get, and due to the combo meter it stops people from being locked into combos forever since once a combo ends you are forced away, either by the opponent's combo ender or the combo forcing itself closed.\n\nThe price that they ask for on Steam you will get more out of the game than you could expect from something this priced. There are two story modes specific to the first two seasons of characters that came out, then with Season 3, which brought back the two original bosses from the franchise, Shadow Lords, a seperate scenario style campaign in which you pick the team that you wish to take in your attempt to overthrow the Shadow Lord himself. That's without taking into account the Shadow Lab mode which allows you to train a Shadow of yourself, an AI that learns and builds off your own patterns to fight in a similar manner to yourself, these Shadows are used within its own unique survival mode, as well as special missions that can crop up within the Shadow Lord mode.\n\nIf you're after a fighting game to get into, or you're looking to get a friend into fighting games, this is the best one that you could possibly start with, since it will not only teach the specific mechanics to this one, but also allow you to learn in time a lot of the mechanics that other competitive fighters share, though this one, eases you into it, so that it is a less daunting experience, as well as being much friendlier to new players.",

It has beautiful art, beautiful music, wonderful narration, it's atmospheric, great characters, meaningful choices, a story of overcoming hardships similar to a real life instead of just a story, and the ending I got was beautiful! I have only played the game once but the game has a lot of different branching paths with choices really making a large difference in the game.  This game will always have a special place in my heart.",
      "So, I hated this game at first...\n\n I've never been into a MMO before, and I went into it with a mindset of \"FUCK YEAH! MULTIPLAYER SKYRIM LETS GO\" - In short don't do that. This isn't going to be like playing Skyrim, Oblivion, Morrowind. \n\nIt is when it all comes down to the core an MMO, it's set in Tamriel, it sounds like Tamriel and the storylines feel like an Elder Scrolls game. However being an MMO, it has a lot of grindy MMO style quests. And don't get me wrong, it's bewildering at first, all these mechanics, all these places to go....and before the 'One Tamriel' update if you chose the wrong faction, you were screwed, in a place all on your own surrounded by all these people who are WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY higher level than you. But thankfully they changed all of that. The game scales now, so you can rock up to a dungeon with your level V300 mate, and still have some fun slicing up enemies.\n\nSo I saw a friend playing the other day, and spent a few hours installing this to join him (By the way its like 70 Gig...If you have slow internet prepare for a few days of download), I got back on it after not playing for 14 months, but this time I was playing with a friend who was already Veteran Level 250, So I was in luck, he introduced me to everything and I got used to all the deconstructing of equipment to get my blacksmithing up, showed me about dungeons and bascially got me to enjoy the grind. I think my previous time was a bit lackluster because I got dropped in the middle of the Aldmeri Dominion on my own, without any of my friends. So I left.\n\nNow I know what I'm doing, and keep in mind I usually hate MMO's never played WoW or anything like that, this is the first one. I'm enjoying myself, I'm triple digits into this game time-wise and I don't see it stopping now. We've made a guild for noobies. To help them out, and get them to enjoy the game also. Because the community is nice...but you still get the elitist fucks from any competitive game kicking you out of dungeons because you're only level 14. But you won't get that when you're in a guild, having people to play with and explain all the mechanics did help, a lot. I've even gone as far as to buy this AGAIN on steam just to collect my hours and so on.\n\nAdd-ons are awesome being able to mod basic features of the game to help with information and quality of life improvements is a must. I'll provide an essential mods pack if any of you wish to know.\n\nFor those of you who actually got this far into this, well done. I didn't think I'd keep you captivated long enough to get to the end.\n\nIf any of you are new to the game, on EU server and would like to join a guild to show you the way, add me or visit our [url=www.godsofsalt.com]website[/url] and join us on teamspeak, or just message us in game @diseasedcrow.\n\nBut all in all if you like Elder Scrolls and you think you want to try this, just do, I'm glad I gave it a second chance.",
      "This game looks incredible and I'm really enjoying the story so far. It does have some bugs still, but nothing I've come across has particularly bothered me, much less ruined the game. It's incredibly immersive and detailed, the voice acting is really good, and the gameplay is fun.",
      "As a fan of Mimimi's Stealth Strategy Game,\nI love it so much, the operation system is getting smoother and more user-friendly comparing to Desperados III & Shadow Tactics.\nAlso I like how they added new elements to the game to make it more playable (E.g. Flexible team choice, character stories)\n\nThe only thing I don't like is the art.\nGame design is good but it'd be great if there's good looking characters...",
      "Horrible game couldn't learn how to drift in 13 hours i was using a wheel btw apparently its harder but like wheel is cool I'm not gonna play it on controller that's lame. My dad also couldn't drift either and he knows how to drift irl. I also cant get a refund because i spent so long try to drift :(",
      "As i previously stated, i was going to play through metro fully and i have done so, so here is my update to this review. \nThis game is not the best selling triple A game in the world and it may have some bugs (like a table that wasnt solid or the objects in that room lol) however it is a decent game. the story is decent and the characters voices are way off but they sorta make up for it with their personalities. \n\nExploration in this game is by far one of the most interesting in my opinion and the way your character acts in the enviroment makes it more interesting aswell, for example wiping your visor when it gets dirty (wasnt that helpful for me in my play through but it was a nice touch) and your visor taking damage in combat adds to the immersive feel of this wasteland/paradise almost. Scavenging weapons and parts and combining them to make better equipment is quite intriguing and quick to do if you can find the parts. \n\nat the end of the day my final review of this is its a good game i would play it again even if it is a bit clunky sometimes (atleast it was for me lmao)\n\n\n\n\n\nOh and hopefully my punctuation is good enough so no one passes out this time lmao",
      "\nWell, after almost a year of not playing this game, I must say, the devs did fix most of my issues. *Most*. Creative mode is fun, but you still need to collect stuff to make things, which is incredibly tedious. On top of that, the character dialogue is still really annoying and you need a NASA computer to play at a stable framerate, but hey, you can actually play without getting your ass beat. I'd like to up my ranking to an 8/10. Very fun, but I highly recommend playing with others. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOG REVIEW (outdated):\nThis game has potential, but unfortunately having fun with it is impossible if you aren't a hardcore survivalist.\n\nCritical Issue #1:\nThe main characters won't stop talking. Everytime you eat or hold the torch they say an unfunny one-liner that makes me want to gouge my eyes out with forks. Even Robin Ayou from Subnautica: Below Zero talked less, and the original game had a silent protaganist. Having characters that have constant dialogue that always repeats is just so annoying to the point where I had to turn off the volume. If the main characters were silent but atleast talked with each other, then I could see potential in that. But they just talk and talk and talk and none of it means anything.\n\nCritical Issue #2:\nThe enemies are way too hard to battle. To make better gear, you need to take on enemies that are so difficult to battle. Maybe you could say I'm just not good at battling enemies in survival games, but I was able to easily battle monsters in Terraria, Minecraft, Subnautica and Raft just fine. When your in-game monsters are too hard to defeat without gear that requires you to battle even MORE monsters, it is not fun, repetitive, and frustrating.\n\nCritical Issue #3:\nThe story is in the background. The fact that the story doesn't impact the game as much as it should is probably the worst aspect of any piece of media out there. The game sends you an a goose chase to find the  main story and it is infuriating. The story itself is all over the place. First it just seems like you need to make yourself grow bigger, but then it goes completely off the rails and into this scientist bunker with a robot that gives you quests, but you can ignore him and continue playing. I don't know if they finished the story, but so far it is not good.\n\nSomewhat Critical Issue:\nThere is no setting to dial back the graphics without lowering the resolution to look like Terraria. I can't see, and it is dumb and brings the whole beautiful vibe of being small down, ironically.\n\nMinor Issues:\nThe music is bland, and although I love electronic/synth music, this is just not it. The fact that you can't have bugs as pets or mounts, or even herd them is extremely upsetting. The farming sucks ass, it gives you 4 items of what you grew every 2 in-game days, when you can just find that item in more abundance at the place where it is located. Under the pond... JESUS CHRIST, the graphics are so bad. The wavy filter looks so bad, and you can see the entire underwater area crystal f**king clear, even though other smaller bodies of water have some kind of murkiness to it. Minor issues like this hold back the game.\n\nAlthough this is still in early access, it feels as if they wasted a lot of potential already. For such a unique world and concept, it never really exploits the amazing and obvious things that it can accomplish. Why not grow your own personal army of ants? Oh sorry, you can pick up eggs but they hatch and they aren't friendly. Why not create a raft made of weed stems and lilypads? Oh sorry, you can just build a base that looks like a boat. Although there are much worse steam games out there, and ones that I have hated more than this, this was sort of a slap to the face. It's not god-awful, and there are a lot of good things about it like the cartoony bug designs and the beautiful graphics, but honestly, it's a 6/10 bordering on a 7, and although many others have enjoyed this, being the super critical demogorgon that I am, this didn't exactly \"ground\" me.",
      "To date, AirMech is the closest thing to a fun MOBA-strategy hybrid I've ever played. Unfortunately, after I came back to this game recently, I have to change my review from Highly Recommended to Not Recommended (this is solely for AirMech Strike, and not related to Wastelands, its PvE counterpart, which I will do a review on at a later date).\n\nTowards the end of 2012, the game was doing really well. There were 500+ players online on average, and it was real easy to get a match.\n\n(+) PVP was simple. Choose your airmech, pilot, unit list, and one item that gives a certain minor bonus. Cosmetics are optional and offer no advantage.\n(+) Player Market introduced later on for trading cosmetic items.\n(+) Badges for people who supported the game.\n(+) Diamond rolls in the chat where players can randomly win Diamonds.\n\nHowever, some downsides also happened.\n(-) You need to pay fees to list an item on the market, using Diamonds, instead of Kudos.\n(-) Books were introduced to either increase trade slots and decrease fees. You needed to spend more Diamonds on these books.\n(+/-) Parts were introduced, adding buffs/debuffs to your AirMechs, though I personally preferred to limit stat customization to Pilots and Items, keeps things simple.\n(-) Nanoforge was introduced for crafting, but is a complicated mess. This wasn't necessary if the game itself wasn't so complex.\n\nWhen AirMech split into AirMech Strike and AirMech Wastelands:\n(-) Parts, Pilots and items were transferred to Wastelands. RIP customization for PVP.\n(+) Keys now available via daily login rewards (the only improvement I've seen).\n(-) Airmech balancing is way off. Once simple skills are now too specific, and there's no need for an ultimate skill, really. AirMech was fine without it.\n\n5 years later and the peak is just over 100 players. The devs took a simple fun game and made it so incredibly complicated that it's no longer a fun game, for me at least.\n\nI hope Carbon Games brings AirMech closer to the late 2012 version, which I feel is the best and most fun version.",
      "Guys this game is brilliant!!\n\nIf you have the chance and you like nostalgic and engaging exploration and mystery solving, I promise you won't regret buying this one.\nI honestly kept searching for more games like this at Steam and I was not able to find any that were this good.\n\nThe pixelated artwork is >very< detailed.\nI don't know how to describe it, but every scene feels like it's straight out of a framed vintage painting that you'd see in a farm cottage made by the grandfather of the previous owner. It just has this vibe, and I love it.\n\nAll characters are voiced and the VAs did a really great job, especially the main VA. Sarcastic, funny and witty lines are all over, as well as capturing the weight of each life, of their memories, and when they share their stories.\n\nYou won't regret playing this one! Go ahead, and have a great excavation...\nDon't forget: the answer lies in the soil...",

Yes.\nIs it fair and enjoyable? Well, it depends.\nGames get very intense, and playing as killer is some of the most intense gaming experience I've ever accumulated...\nWhich is where things often go wrong. The survivors seem to have decided that the killers have to honor strict code of rules. Don't use these items, these abilities, or these strategies. If you do, you'll be insulted after the game.\nIf you follow these rules, the odds are that you will spend the game running in literal circles, the survivors will win, t-bag you at the gate and then insult you after the game. I don't know about you, but that kind of ruins the game for me. It is actually kind of amazing how helpless one can feel in this game.\n\nSo to conclude my thoughts; I really like the game, but I also really hate it. I can't recommend it, as every time I fire it up, there is about 50% chance I feel more harassed, than entertained.\nI play a lot of online games, from League of Legends to Tekken, but this is the only one that makes me frequently think: \n\"I should really uninstall this\"\n\nEdit: \nI returned after a long break, and I still kinda like the game. \nHowever, same pattern repeats whenever I return. Eventually, I get teabagged one time too many and uninstall the game. The game is fun, the community could not be much worse. And sadly, that often ruins the experience.",

      "One of the better RPG maker games i've seen and played, especially considering it was made on RPG Maker 2003. The beginning of the game was great and felt like there was a ton of potential, but a lot of the overworld mechanics were underutilized (jumping, swimming, orb flying). The writing was alright in the beginning, but started to turn into a bad fanfic in the middle/end of the game. The ending was... wholly unsatisfying and abrupt. It made very little sense, and did absolutely nothing to answer any questions asked at any point in the game, rather asking brand new questions and providing no resolution for any of the characters. You'll get about 10-14 hours of this game, which is kind of amazing for an RPG maker game, but honestly, steam has SOOOO many better titles available in this price range that unless you're into RPG maker, you should go elsewhere.",
      "You know that feeling when you are hesitant to buy a game because you're worried you might waste your money on something that might be a crap game in the end, get boring, and not sure if you should believe all the ratings because you dont know if everyone has the same interests and likes as you? well this game is the bomb diggity, straight up. Made by the same people who made rollercoaster tycoon and man did they deliver on this. For me it's the small things in a game that matter and did they really take the time to make sure this was as polished as it could be. Not sure if anyone remembers when they announced another rollercoaster tycoon a while back, and everyone was super excyited to find out what it was, and it ended up being some dumbass phone app? Well imagine all that excyitment, but instead of them coming out with that stupid app they came out with this bad boy. This is exactly what everyone was wishing and hoping for (just different name). Do I reccomend you buy this game? hell yes. will it be exactly what you are wishing for when you fist clicked this game to see the game play and reviews? sure as cocks will. But will it be just as fun as the original?.... YOU BET YOUR MOMS TITS IT WILL BE. \n\nPROS:                                \nbeen one since 1990\n\nCons:\nYou'll never know how fun it is till you buy it.",

      "A new game from Zeboyd, you know I'm there! And this was such a fun game\n\nThis game is about as long as Cthulhu Saves Christmas and it's just as Linear. However given their statement on this video, that's meant to be the point these days.\n\nThe Graphics for the main game are basic but it's fitting for the Genre. Also they have dropped the random battles with on screen monsters to avoid if you want to not fight (And you still have the option to start a battle through the main menu). The fighting system is identical to CSC too which I've enjoyed but I can understand those who may not like it. The Animation for the transformations are incredible...except I'm always stuck watching them every single time which can get very tedious.\n\nThe story is clever, and they provide \"Translations\" for the Ole English of Shakespeare...but a lot of the translations are jokes and very silly ones at that.\n\nThere isn't a LOT of replay value but you will enjoy the story enough you'll want to play it again eventually.\n\nThere is no New Game Plus mode...yet but given how they patched it into CSC later on I'm certain they're do that here eventually.\n\nI say the game is incredible for the price range and is entertaining for all ages.\n\n\nVIDEO REVIEW: https://youtu.be/wuw9pJPowqM",
      "Ok so let me start off by saying that I absolutely loved the first game in this series. I loved the subtle changes when you compared character interaction throughout the game as you progressed playing non-lethally/lethally. Now I never buy games at launch, I always wait for sales. When I got Dishonored 1 for $2 I was blown away and mad at myself for waiting for such a sale. I would've happily spent more on that game, it was worth it. Now all that said, here we are at Dishonored 2:\n\nPros\n- Mechanics have been vastly improved upon and the gameplay is just so much more fluid. As much as I loved the previous game I can't deny it was somewhat clunky.\n- Customization is so much better! The upgrades are plentiful and the bonecharm crafting system is awesome once you realize what you are doing. It really expands on how many options you really have at your disposal.\n\nCons\n- The difficulty still just isn't there for me. I LOVED that there was a custom difficulty mode, but even making things harder than the 'very hard' difficulty I still completed the game using no powers and never getting detected with relative ease(I did save A LOT obviously). The only things that really present a challenge are the clockwork soldiers, and as the plot of the game makes evident, you really don't encounter those enough to really present a big challenge.\n- The story is weak, plain and simple. It was like you were on a storyboard that used the same format as the previous game. The story, especially the universe and how you were immersed into it, was a big part of the why I loved the first game.\n- How low vs high chaos is handled. It isn't like there are no changes, in fact I was surprised a few times in my 2nd playthrough which I was doing as a hardcore murderer of every man, woman, and child(if there was any) that crossed my path. It just never really changed the dynamic enough like Dishonored 1 did. The way the final mission in the first game played out when comparing no killing playthroughs with bloody ones was VASTLY different right from the start of the mission.\n\nAll in all it wasn't a bad game. I still definitely enjoyed it for being a niche genre game. Just maybe I would have liked the game to stand out more like the first did.",
      "No one sees \"Purchases made in this region will only receive the Russian language.\" before the release data\n\nThis really kills me.\n\nThey didn't say there would be a region lock before.\n\nBut today, the release date, there is one.\n\nWell the fxxk done Ubsoft",
      "\"It has guns, swords, sexy characters, cheesy dialogues, and a whole lot of action. What more do you want?\" somebody posted and is recommending this pile of poo.

Should have bought some dinner instead of wasting money on this bollox.",
      "FEZ was overhyped.\n\nThere is no denying that. When I first started playing it, I was let down. The world-turning mechanics were boring, the platforming unresponsive, at least to my tastes, the art style didn't suit me. I wondered, what was it that people loved so much about FEZ. I hated the game so much that I dropped it almost immediately.\n\nFast-forward to yesterday, to the day that everything changed. I forced myself to play just a bit more in order to at least beat it. I thought I was returning to the land of tedium, and yet this wasn't the case. Maybe it was the anti-hype quarantine period that helped. I discovered that this game was not what it seems. Instead of platforming, I found increasingly challenging puzzles. It was filled with cryptic messages, lingustic riddles, hidden ciphres. It was fascinating. \n\nThis game does nothing to help you discover it's true beauty. It's radiance comes from the fact that it holds you to extremely high standards. What other game forces you to decrypt a language using a Rosetta stone like device? Pen and paper are a must here.\n\nThink of a brutally hard, unforgiving game. Be it Super Hexagon, Dark Souls, Super Meat Boy, I'm sure you remember the extreme sense of accomplishment that surged through you when you conquered it's many challenges. FEZ is like that, only instead of your reflexes, it challenges your mind. Do yourself a favor and play it. Do yourself another favor, and never use guides. You will love it. I promise.",
      "Read all the 10 negative reviews for the game, and not a single positive review is present. All the reviews are fairly accurate to what the game presents to its players. A tacky First-Person Shooter with bad FPS rates, mediocre animations and effects, as well as a cursor that is not even aligned to the target pointer. No comment on the goal, as it is either self-explanatory, or the audio and Sound effects, as it was nothing note-worthy.\n\nIn short, not a single pro is evident in this game, or in my experience during playing. By the end of it, I simply ran Tales of Destruction for the Trading Cards, then uninstalled, and proceeded to Hide from library.\n\nTales of Destruction is not worth a single cent, nor is it worth playing.",
      "As the holder of a degree in Plant Sciences, I wholeheartedly endorse this game.\n\nReal talk: One of the best things about this game is how it totally commits to the old-timey apothecary/greenhouse theme-- it’s extremely atmospheric. It also has a compelling story with recurring characters that you can affect with your choices. If the prospect of discovering and using plants to solve problems (or mayhap even a grim mystery) appeals to you, I recommend trying this game.",
      "[b] Target Audience: [/b] [I] Anyone with a Soul[/i]\n\n[b] Summary: [/b]  \n\nIt's a damn shame that this game isn't topping people's game of the year list this year, because Wandersong is one of the best story based experiences that I've played on Steam. A game that is beautiful woven from start to end, every element works together in harmony to make what will be a cult classic in my mind: and only a cult classic due to the fact that it should be a blockbuster, but won't get the recognition. The 3 man team took an upbeat story of a young bard on a whismical journey and \nmade someone who usually gravitates toward more depressing/out there stories and fall in love with the Bard, Miriam, and the vast cast of characters here. \n\nThe funny thing is, it's hard to quantify what makes Wandersong such a complete package, because everything works in harmony so well with everything else. Take the music for example: I actually struggled to specifically remember any individual track at first, and that's because the games tracks are so tied to the emotions that you feel during scenes. You are the music in how you play through your game, you experience this game how you want, and it's singing mechanic that alters the world aroudn you allows you to be the player you want to be while still staying in a relatively linear story line. The color and presentation is fantastic, the gameplay mechanics stay just long enough before changing up, it's hard to really think of anything that the game did wrong.\n\nLook, even those who may hate games with less “gameplay” will most likely be charmed by Wandersong's spell. It's a siren of sorts: except it'll make you crash into jagged rocks of love and happiness. Story elements feel earned. Everything has very specific detail. It's clear this was a labor of love, and it shows even in the scene select: where the splooshes by the team just make you smile. You will sit and wonder about your own life after playing certain sections, and the club scene is one of the best set pieces I've seen in character development. Honestly, I really struggle to think of negatives for the game: each thing has a purpose and is there for a specific reason, and executes it beautifully. \n\nIf you're reading this review, it's because you're considering buying the game. Do it. Do it now. It's worth it.\n\n[b]Video Review: [/b] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ycIvIVfblk\n\n[u] Lists: [/u]\n[b]Positives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Oozes charm and love.\n[*] A fantastic buddy story that is great from start to finish.

All of it.\n[*] Colored presentation is sharp and vividly pleasing, while always matching the emotion of what it's depicting.\n[*] Music drives the game forward via emotion: and makes you remember the set pieces and small moments easily.\n[*] Perfect for all ages: and adapts to the way you view it. \n[*] Every game needs a dance button. Every game. This proves it.\n[*] Attention to detail making every action feel like it effects the world makes a game you can get lost in.\n[*] Length of the game is perfect for story being told.\n[*] Each gameplay mechanic cleverly twists the singing base element and uses it in a new way. Only stays long enough before it gets over used, and then moves on to the next.\n[*] Controls work rather well and great indicators for actions.\n[*] Despite music focus, can still be played by deaf/colorblind players.\n[*] No performance issues.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Negatives:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] There's one jump in the game that will frustrate you. This is literally the worst thing I can think about this game. \n[*] Once in a while the game gets a strange bug that makes you laugh more then anything.\n[*] People expecting fantastic gameplay aren't going to get it here, but the thing is, it fits the game and the story. \n[*] That it hasn't sold more.\n[/list]\n\n[b] If you want more reviews/information regarding games I've reviewed, visit my curator.

      "Plays and looks just like the Park Ranger and Cruise Director HOG series, if you enjoyed those then you will likely enjoy this series. Game is composed of hidden object scenes and simple puzzle transitions that have a loose story to bridge the movement between them. The hidden object scenes follow an older couple as they take their grandchildren to a variety of European counties on their vacation, they sprinkle in a few interesting facts between each location. There are collectibles in each scene along with a raccoon. I overall enjoyed it for a laid back experience and the weirdly fun photostock based scenes. It took me about 2.5 hours to play through the game along with the bonus scenes/puzzles.",
      "An amazingly fun and short adventure from the creator of Rakuen. Mr. Saitou is a game based in the same universe as Rakuen, but follows the story a salaryman, Mr. Saitou. Mr. Saitou takes you on a journey that explores some serious undertones, but approaches the subjects with incredible sensitivity, respect and some very light and silly humor. There's tons of flavor text to be discovered, pop culture references to be recognized and if you've played Rakuen, familiar characters to meet. As you make your way through the story, there are lots of puzzles that are simplistic, but well thought out in a way that adds to the story.The game is made to be played in 1 sitting that may vary depending on how much you interact with the world. This game can also be played by many ages and is family friendly. You DO NOT have to play Rakuen first to enjoy this game or understand it, but it will definitely add a depth of sentimentality to the game, as there are some call backs. I would absolutely recommend this game to anyone and you may find yourself learning something about your own life during Mr. Saitou's journey.Have a long day!",
      "This game is a mood-lifter, absolutely! Sweet colors, catchy music, wonderful narrator saying very kind words, the sound effects are poppy and fun, it's rewarding to watch the donuts drift across the puzzle. This is the kind of game you play to vibe and unwind after a hard day, refreshing and sweet. <3",
      "PC version doesn't have rebindable controls for controller for some reason\n\nupdate: i have finished the game, still no rebindable controls, i can give a real review now. i wouldn't rate it negative but i wouldn't rate it positive either. this is a \"eh\" review.\n\nthe game is two games at once and neither of them are great.\n\n the roguelike part is like 20% of the game and is very simple and shallow, there's like 5 weapons and they all play the same, its also super easy. its ok but its not as good as a real roguelike.\n\n the cult building part is 80% of the game and is a bit more fun but past the earlygame its a bit eh too. choosing what you get doesn't really matter since you'll unlock everything pretty fast, and the doctrines 90% of the time are a choice between 2 useless things and 10% of the time a choice between a busted thing and a useless thing. the randomly generated quests the followers give you are just chores like revisiting old dungeons you already completed and the reward is pretty much nothing. its ok but its not as good as a real colony builder.\n\nnone of the systems in either part of the game are particularly deep.\n\nas of the time of this review, the game is still quite glitchy, though being patched by the devs.\n\nthe game is about 15 hours with side content and 18 hours for a completionist run. no real replayability \n\ni'd just recommend you get a full on action roguelike if you want to play a roguelike, or a full on colony builder if you want to play a colony builder. this game does both but is not great at either of them. \n\n game is very cute tho and the soundtrack is great. like 5/10",
      "   I just finished playing the 5th episode 😭. It feels incredibly sad to say \"Good Bye\" to this game. While playing I had a chance to get to know every in game character, especially Max and Chloe. They've become like my new friends, we've been through so much together, and realizing that it's over now, it's hella tough. \n   I've seen a lot of great games before, but never did a game make me feel SO connected to its characters. And every time you need to make a choice, you start seeing everything you've been through before and thinking how to make things even better. But I think the most important thing here is not to overthink (I mean not to try to Google what consequences your choice is going to have because it kills all the excitement of not knowing). Just do what feels right and what your heart tells you even if you might be wrong. I guess that's the lesson I learned in here. \n   Other important things that make Life Is Strange my favorite game: The developers paid attention to the smallest details, some of them you don't even notice playing for the first time, but the fact that they're there makes me appreciate it even more. The graphics is hella amazing, you just have to see it for yourself :) The plot and the music complement each other in subtle ways, and I can guarantee you'll have at least several of the soundtracks in your favorites playlist ;) \n   The game's definitely worth its money and even more. I wish I'd be able to forget everything that happened in the game and start playing it from the very beginning, so I'd be able to feel everything with the same intensity I did during my first playthrough. But I'll definitely come back to it after some time just to do it all over again. \n   Dear Developers, THANK YOU so much for Life Is Strange. I wish you all the best and I'm looking forward to seeing more masterpieces from you.",
      "This is how a Remake should be made, feels and plays much better than the original. The overall game design be it characters or the level is amazing!

      "Ahh, CrossCode.\nLet's start this review with what this game does right.\n\nPros:\nEverything. There review is complete. But on a serious note I'll elaborate.\n\nThis game starts out very generically. You got an amnesia stricken heroine. You got fairly archetypal characters. The story is the typical trying to figure out your past. But it's not. I lied about all that, that only covers the first 10-15 hours then you see drastic changes in the pace and tone. The story turns out to be well done, not the best, but enjoyable. 8/10 for story and characters.\n\nLet's talk about gameplay. It's perfect, seriously. The pacing of combat is fairly quick. There's a decent variety of enemy types which nearly all of them have some sort of unique trait. Your skill set leaves you with a lot of variety and different tools to take on different situations. I have yet to get bored of it, despite the fact combat isn't inherently profitable for most of the game. Puzzles. You have timing puzzles, logic puzzles, memory puzzles, enemy based puzzles. It's all there. It's all enjoyable. They're quite varied, no two puzzles feel the same. This game has over 200 'maps'. And just about every 'map' has a puzzle or two (optional or not). Ez 10/10.\n\nArt design. I'm a sucker for 16 and 32 bit graphics. The level designer, this guy made the game. He created some beautiful and interconnected maps with nearly everything having purpose. In all honesty, I have never seen design quality this high, it even beats out SquareSoft games (you know before they became that crappy company that is SE). 10/10 again.\n\nCharacter design. It works. Not the best. Not bad. The characters look the way they should. Lukas' nose drives me crazy, it's huge. But Holiday Man is solid. 7/10.\n\nMusic. Some of it's great. Some of it annoyed ME (but I'm picky). They stayed true to what they were trying to make. But it's obvious their composer was no Yasunori Mitsuda. But still, what I enjoyed, I really enjoyed. 8/10.\n\nDid I enjoy it? Every single minute of it. Even when I was confused. \"I WILL figure this puzzle out.\" 35/40, based off my personal taste, but CrossCode is as damn near perfect as you can get.",
      "(This is a spoilerfree Review)\nI recommend not to search any character or even the name of the game to avoid spoilers.\n\nBasic:\nDanganronpa Trigger Happy Havoc is a murder-mystery game with a focus on deep Story.\nThere are 3 main games and 1 spin-off game. This is the First one to start with.\nYou can expect about 40 to 50 hours in this game (depending on how fast you can read and think)\nI recommend reading all dialogue and not skipping any cutscenes.\nThe overall gameplay is simple and hard at the same time, but I bet everybody could play it.\n\nStory: (Spoilerfree/no spoiler)\nThe game is about a bunch of Students who were being dragged into a Killing Game.\nThe only way to escape is by killing another Student and getting away with it.\nYou'll learn more about it while playing, there are a bunch of unsolved questions in the beginning.\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay is mostly divided into 2 different Parts: typical visual novel gameplay\n(freetime use and social interaction) and the Class Trials. In these class trials\nyou have to solve some Minigames but mostly try to discover the Murderer (or imposter if you played Among us).\nThe class trials are definitely the best Part of the game and you can be hyped about each of them.\nBefore each class trial you have to do some Investigation about the Murder and during that time you can\ntheorize who it was and how they've done it.\n\nCharacters:\nThe characters in this Game are as different as they can be. I bet you'll have different favourite ones.\nAll I can say is that you'll learn to love each and everyone on their own way.\n\nBuy Recommendation:\nDo I recommend everybody to buy this Game? No. If you are getting bored because you mostly \nonly play Shooters and MOBA's, I dont think you will enjoy this Game even if I did. But to everybody else\nwho enjoys mystery games like Ace Attorney or even mystery/detective shows I highly recommend buying this game\nand try it out. You'll enjoy it!\n\nAs I said try to avoid any spoilers. So dont look in the Steam Workshops etc.\nThank you for reading!",

      "Wow, talk about a disappointment. I was really excited to check out \"ASU Global\" but it's clear that the developers didn't put much effort into it. From the glitchy login process to the lack of translation and sound effects, it's clear that this game is a rushed, poorly executed mess. And to top it off, it's just a generic mobile Korean port. Save yourself the trouble and skip this one. It's not worth the hassle.",
      "If you are into space opera, transhumanism, cyperpunk-esque narratives, you're going to have a great time with this one.

      "the game itself is pretty ok and fun for what it is, and runs great on deck. but man, F**K THE ALWAYS-ONLINE-DRM WHICH AT TIMES TAKES AGES TO CONNECT, GETTING THE GAME STUCK IN THE MENU WITH NOTHING TO DO!!\n\n>> Update after 20h played:\nI really enjoy playing the game. It is good, it is fun and runs great on the Steam Deck, which is especially important to me, as I tend to travel a lot as part of my job.\n\nThat being said, however, is core of the issue: The Always-On-DRM actually prevents me from playing this game on the go. Having this sort of DRM is, in my opinion, only predatory and inexcusable in any way. I get that the online-components of the game will not work when I am on the move, but I am mainly interested in the single player experience, from which I am also locked out. I am even locked out of the main menu without a stable internet collection, which is just ridiculous.",
      "Stellaris is the contemporary 4X sci fi galactic empire grand strategy to play.  The spiritual successor to ancient space exploration games like Master of Orion and Star Wars: Rebellion.  Start out with just your homeworld and send out scout ships and colonies until you've got your own star empire. \n\nManage your population, tell them what to build, design your own spaceships and fleet structures, and then get pounded into the dirt by the far too cheaty AI... yeah, it's another one of those games where because it's hard to make the AI smart, Paradox decided instead to just make the AI units cheat and become ridiculously overpowered.\n\nI have to say the game is probably far too difficult even if you set all the difficulty to the easiest levels, it's unclear what the developers were thinking, but you can mod the game easily in Steam Workshop to make it viable to play single player. \n\nAs with all Paradox games the DLC pricing is murder, and it adds very little to the core game experience, so my advice is to grab this on sale if you were a fan of MOO, go straight to Steam Workshop and mod it until it's playable, and then you'll have a perfect time sink well worth your money.",
      "I came across Dreamscaper after playing 200 hours of Hades. I was looking for similar games that could recapture some of the magic of discovery and progression that made Hades such a delightful experience.\n\nDreamscaper is not Hades. There probably isn't any game that can measure up to the experience of playing Hades, and there probably won't be for a long while. But a lot of the same elements are there, and I did really enjoy Dreamscaper for what it was.\n\nThe \"story\" in Dreamscaper is more of a personal journey. There aren't really \"events occurring\" so much as a character working through her issues. The supporting characters are fairly interesting, though not quite on par with the literally larger-than-life dynamic personalities of Hades. But to be fair, the characters in Dreamscaper are ordinary folks, not mythological deities.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the game is \"nostalgic.\" It's an exploration of the protagonist's childhood memories, so that makes sense. There is a very different energy here than Hades' cheeky and horny angst. It's more sad and calm.\n\nIn terms of the feel of playing the game, Dreamscaper has a lot of similarities to Hades. There is a varied arsenal of different weapons and abilities, progression through randomized levels with boss fights, a wide selection of permanent character upgrades to purchase using resources gathered during runs, a relationship system to grow closer with the characters, etc. Unlike Hades, every aspect of your loadout can change throughout a run: you can swap out weapons and abilities as you encounter new and better ones along the way. It's both more flexible than Hades and less; you're not locked in to one weapon for the entire run, and there are many more weapons and abilities (and combinations thereof); but with more randomness comes less control, so it's a lot harder to craft and hone a particular build in Dreamscaper than in Hades. A lot of the \"builds\" are elemental damage modifiers, in which all you're trying to do is find a bunch of gear that (say) deals Lightning damage or increases your Lightning damage dealt. The upgrades are largely \"number get bigger,\" and while it can be satisfying to get a bunch of cool multipliers, it does feel less \"combo\"y or \"breakable\" than Hades (though there are certainly some very powerful and broken-feeling builds you can end up with).\n\nThe gameplay is challenging, like Hades, though perhaps slightly less. Like Hades, a lot of your ability to clear rooms and defeat bosses effectively comes from learning their attack patterns and timings. I do wish there were more variety to the enemies, as many of them are just \"the guy from the last level but he is stronger and has more abilities now\" (though that criticism applies to Hades as well). The boss fights are by and large much easier once you learn their patterns, though there are still a few that can be tough for certain builds. The \"hard version\" of bosses are definitely a force to be reckoned with, though.\n\nThe art and music are attractive and inviting. It's much more The Sims than Guilty Gear, but in a way that fits the atmosphere nicely. It's stylized in a very different way than Hades, but it works in its own way.\n\nThe developers are also very community-oriented and are responsive to community input through their Discord. The Hades developers probably are too, but I have no direct experience interacting with them.\n\nSo in conclusion, if you liked Hades because of its horny angst, badass metal riffs, mythological themes, and bloody humor, you may not have much interest in Dreamscaper. But if you liked Hades because of its randomized runs, variety of weapons and builds, feeling of progression, challenging boss fights, and dynamic cast of characters with complicated relationships, then you should absolutely pick up Dreamscaper. And if you didn't like Hades, then you probably stopped reading this review after the first paragraph.",
      "[h1] Brief summary of why the Chinese players are so pissed: [/h1]\n\nThe reason for the chinese players to absolutely despise the third party modding website is that the \"official modding\" was promised to be released over a year ago, but kept getting delayed. When it finally got released, everyone felt betrayed because it was a garbage third party website with so many restrictions.\n\nBut the reason why the game is still getting review bombed is the [b] developer's initial response [/b] to the first round of complaints. The team was dead silent for about 2 weeks, no comments about all the fiasco, yet people that were complaining about the modding on the chinese forums got their accounts banned left and right. Thats why many resorted to steam review bombing, and almost as soon as the steam review tanked, the developer came out and said the steam workshop will be launching in the end of the month, something he had being saying was \"really hard for the team\" and kept \"facing difficulties\" for the past year.\n\nSo yeah.... I kinda understand why people are still really mad about this one",

      "After the past few years of broken, buggy AAA games I've started to lose the passion I once had for the industry. This masterpiece came out of no where and completely reignited my love for gaming. PLEASE do not sleep on this game, it's such a breath of fresh air from the garbage you'd normally expect from modern day companies. Definitely taking a spot in my top 5 favorites and I haven't even scratched the surface of the game yet, it's just that good. Beautiful art style, crisp animations, a unique concept, FUN gameplay, its everything I've been wanting and more. Kudos to the devs for making this absolute banger <3",
      "Never understood why everybody started hating this game.\nFirst it was too hard, so dev made it easier.\nThen it was too clunky, so dev remade the UI again and again (it's still not perfect though but I saw big improvements overtime).\nThen it was another thing and another one and no matter what dev team did, people were still mad at them ...\nI did enjoy this game since the beginning, I adapted each time the game changed and yet people kept whining because it wasn't exactly how they felt it shoud have been.\nAfter all this hard work and still getting pooped in the face, the dev team left ... how strange, right ?\n\nI'm not mad at the dev team, but I'm so sad that people can't understand that making others miserable because they don't have exactly what they want (and having paid for it is no excuse to this behavior in my opinion) will make them give up on their task ...\n\nFor what it's worth, I miss you Handyman team :(, but thank you anyway for the actual game cause I really don't feel that I've been robbed and I still enjoy it from time to time.",
      "MySims, Scribblenauts, Poly Bridge and just plain old Lego building.\n\nIt's hard to describe this game succinctly without drawing a comparison to one of the above so I'll just do it off the top. Bricktales is a very pleasant blend of these sources, offering light accessible and honestly quite relaxing game play centred around a mix of lego building challenges and overworld puzzle solving. It's an ideal game for kids or even adults looking for something breezy, especially considering just how nicely it's presented.\n\nThere's a few small gameplay gripes, the controls for the building mode are decent once you get to grips with them - but getting to grips with them takes a little time. On the over world it can feel like you spend a lot of time switching between traversal powers and watching the corresponding animation. And in some places the game can let you build something that counts as a valid structure but isn't actually traversable for your character. None of these felt like a big issue though.\n\n I think the most engaging thing personally is that the themes chosen (Medieval, Egypt, City, Caribbean and Jungle) are all very familiar genres for original Lego sets of the past, which combined with the simple blocky nature of the things you build in the game makes it feel much closer to the vibe of just playing with Lego as a child than something licensed. There's a very charming *vibe* around this game that I think gives it value beyond something just for children, and is a large part of why I would reccomend it.",
      "This game will leave you satisfied.\n\nI know that doesn't sound like much of a selling point, but it is. This game won't give you a sequal hook, it won't give you a product carved away like a thanksgiving turkey, each part sold seperately or held to ransom. \n\nThis is not a game about standing victorious over your enemies, it's not a game with some kind of adrenal rush that will leave you drained and empty afterwards.\n\nThis isn't a game about saving the world, as surprising as that may sound considering the hero's goal.\n\nThis is a game about hope. Hope for tomorrow, hope for your fellow man, hope for dreams and wishes, hope for a last shimmer of light in the encroaching darkness.\n\nThis is a game that will make you ask things about yourself, even if only subconciously. \n\nBut, most importantly of all, this is an experience that will make you say \"I was happy to be there, if only for a time.\"\n\nAnd I was, in fact, happy to be here.\n\nHats off to you ladies and gentlemen, you made a cyinical old bastard smile for a good ten hours.",
      "The game itself is great, but Square Enix really dropped the ball by removing the true PC version and leaving us with this Switch port as the only option. It's a huge visual downgrade, but it has more content. Luckily though, a small handful of incredible modders have taken the time to painstakingly transfer the old, high-quality PC assets over to this version which is what saved it for me. Without the mods, I would not have kept playing.\n\nIf you're on the fence, I'd say catch it on sale, then head over to a modding site (Nexus is what I used) and start installing the mods that restore this game to its full PC potential. It's probably the easiest-to-mod game I've ever dealt with too btw. You don't have to be super savvy to get things the way you want them and you don't need any additional software. Just grab the .pak files, slap them into the game's pak folder, enjoy. It really is that simple. (You may want to edit some .ini files to tweak things to your liking, but that's as complex as it gets. If you can open Notepad, you can do this.)\n\nAs for the core gameplay, it's an incredibly solid JRPG with a likable cast and well thought out story. There's plenty of content to enjoy here and it has a good end game. The music is absolutely phenomenal as well. Visually, it's very vibrant and the aesthetic is charming. I think it's a fantastic game overall and is very enjoyable as is, but playing it in 1440p/144Hz with high resolution character and texture assets with better lighting/animation mods and subtle character/NPC/monster upgrades totally elevated it to the next level.\n\np.s. If you do install mods, I HIGHLY recommend grabbing the one that removes the black borders around characters! That gives the game a clean and refreshing new feel that greatly improves it in my opinion!",
      "Great game! \nLooking foward for the next chapters of the game!\nI love the spritework, its amazing!\nEven the music is very catchy and memorable \nFor an Early Access game, this game is very charsimatic and has tons of personality!\n\nIts just a shame that it was short in my opinion, i know you are going to add more stuff obviously, but i was hoping to get much more out of it because i loved it alot xD.\n\nPirate Software, I can't stress enough how much my excitement for this game is,  the demo back in 2017 already left me intrigued, but now im excited to see how this all plays out!",
      "It's hard not to compare this with Divinity: Original Sin. Both were funded on Kickstarter, both have a 91% score on Steam, both are rich, engaging cRPGs, and they were released months apart. It's fair to say both games have been wild successes that have surprised even the developers. If you had to pick ONE of these to invest time in which should it be?\n\nTurn-based vs. Real-time with pause: I eventually came to accept and even enjoy the real-time with pause combat of Pillars, though I much prefer turn-based. Real-time combat presents many problems that aren't the result of player mistakes. On numerous occasions I'd have characters stuck in place because the pathfinding didn't work right. The real-time combat often felt like a jumbled, chaotic mess instead of the tactical plan I had set out. Divinity is much cleaner in this respect and offered a much better experience, especially with respect to using the environment as a weapon. With Divinity I felt each power had a time and place, whereas with Pillars I ended up spamming the same powers and hoping for the best.\n\nStory: Pillars of Eternity definity wins out here. While the story in Divinity:OS wasn't bad, I would call it playful to the point of campy. Pillars had a deep, mature fantasy story worthy of a novel. While it was almost too much reading at times, the story was serious, dark, and dealt with real themes. \n\nArt: Pillars harkens back to the golden age of Infinity Engine games like Balgur's Gate, Icewind Dale, Planescape Torment, etc. The scenes are appealing, but prerendered and they felt a little static. This helps stoke the nostalgia for the late 90s, but Divinity feels up-to-date and immersive. Couple the art style of Divinity with it's highly interactive environments, and the world of Original Sin ends up feeling much more alive. \n\nMusic: Both were great soundtracks but Pillars feels just a bit derivative of the Lord of the Rings movies. They aren't bad at all, but almost generically fantasy at times. Music is important here because when you spend tens of hours in these worlds, you're gonna get this music stuck in your head.\n\nIn short, you should play both if you love deep, isometric, high-fantasy, western computer RPGs. If you MUST pick, consider the following choice. Choose Pillars of Eternity if you favor story and choose Divinity: Original Sin if you prefer combat. Both are hallmarks of a great RPG and each specializes beautifully.",
      "The cognitive dissonance in the original Space Quest games between the box cover art telling you that \"Roger Wilco is hapless!\" and the player's necessary mental exertion involved to solve the puzzles, is laid bare the moment you can type in the name you will be called by in the game.\n\nIt's one of the hardest lines to walk when narrative is the main driver of an interactive work:  balancing the player's actions with the personality of the character they are directing in a world that is clearly alive, regardless of the players's presence.\n\nThe Excavation of Hob's Barrow's succeeds in this fully with the denizens and everyday life of the town of Bewlay.\n\nFrom the moment Thomasina Bateman starts recounting the events that led to her writing a letter to her mother, any ambiguity is dispelled: the player is helping Thomasina relive her time in starkly bucolic Bewlay. But as players spend more time within the memories and stories Thomasina shares, the more off putting the narration becomes. It's not just that Thomasina is an unreliable narrator—the implications of the traumatic events that occured at Hob's Barrow are still a puzzle to be worked out. \n\nThis is the strength of the narrative design and writing in Hob's Barrow: as entertainingly crafted as linear story or film, but with eartnest player engagement required to work out what's happening in the very deep shadows of this cursed place.\n\nThe fantastic writing is supported by equally fantastic pixel art, music, and some of the best voice work I've heard in games…ever? The codgers, critters, and countryside all sound fantastic, the bleakness of the moors churning from peaceful to menacing with expert orchestration. Visual direction is solid, too, with sparingly, effectively used pixel portraits and closeups to highlight details both grotesque and filled with character. The dark undercurrent of humour throughout the game also adds some replayability for achievement hunters: some encounters are worth revisiting!\n\nI played this entirely on Steam Deck, mostly curled up in bed at night, but enjoyed the grand finale while docked on my TV. Performance and control was flawless, regardless.\n\nOne of my favorite games released in 2022, and definitely one of my favorite adventure games of all time.",

Bear with me. My career isn't accessible. Let me restart the client and get back to gushing over the game. The physics model from Dirt Rally has been pretty much refined upon in every single way, with new features such as Tyre Wear, and Track Degredation making significant changes to how you'll attack each stage, having the ability to select tyre type matters too, since each tyre type will wear through the available grip differently (and the state of the track will in turn factor how fast you chew through those t-\n\n[H1]Wait for it, waaaaait for iiiiiit....[/H1]\n\n\"Connecting to racenet, it appears there is a discrepancy between your data and Racenet, your event has been reset.\"\n\n...

      "I'm 17 years old. I'm sitting in front of my Pentium II PC and I've just finished installing Baldur's Gate. I've crafted my perfect character, and I'm now adventuring through a gorgeous world. I've fallen headfirst into the game reading novels worth of text and not noticing as hours melt away.\n\nIt's 17 years later. I'm 34 years old. I'm doing it all over again and it's like I'm travelling through time.\n\nEvery aspect of this game is perfect. I wouldn't change it even if I could. I find myself wondering how in-game mechanics work and I'm tempted to alt+tab and google what spell is best. Instead I just keep playing and figure it out myself. I can't even *remember* the last time I didn't look up this sort of info in a game. Who cares if this sword does a little more damage than that spear? My character likes that spear and he looks awesome wielding it.\n\nThis is the first Kickstarter decision I've made that I am completely happy with. Thanks Obsidian for taking me back in time and reminding me that you don't need gamefaqs to enjoy a game.",
      "DON'T BUY THIS GAME!\nThis is one of the best games I've ever played. It is quite possibly the best and most detailed Choose-Your-Own-Adventure novel ever written and if you buy it now the creators will receive *NO COMPENSATION* for their work. I am thankful i bought it when I did, while they were still involved, but due to contracting and political differences (ironically fitting for the content of the game) the 2 or 3 writers who pioneered this project were cut out and can't receive royalties anymore.\nThis is a game about the inherent flaws in dogmatic political ideologies, all ideologies including centrism and being a moderate, and it was essentially stolen by capitalists.\nI love this game with all my heart. It is a beautiful story about loss, depression, and finding meaning in a chaotic and absurd reality. Anything more is kinda spoilery so I'm gonna stop myself there. It is all narrated so you dont have to read the enormous amount of text on your own and it is HILARIOUS. Depressing at times but always that spark of humor lingers.\nDON'T BUY THIS GAME. And *DEFINITELY* don't *PIRATE THIS GAME*. Even though it is totally in line with the messaging of the game, would be a HUGE middle finger to the corporation that cut the writers out of their own creation, and is super easy to do with like an an hour of searching Reddit or something, *YOU SHOULD* not *PIRATE THIS OUTSTANDING GAME*. Thank you for reading this, I hope you do the right thing, and you should totally hit on that girl at the beginning she is super into you and there will be no repercussions. Peace.",
      "The Steam version of this game has some serious problems, most notably the high chance of losing your entire account. The game's servers have sync issues with Steam, and thus are not reliable at saving your progress. I played for 8 hours only to lose all progress and the entire account, forcing a restart from scratch.\n\nIf you link your google account, this seems to provide a reliable way for the game to save your progress, but nothing ever tells you this. It's absolutely inexcusable that the Marvel Snap servers cannot link to a unique Steam account without needing to link a gmail.\n\nAside from these massive issues, the gameplay is quite fun. However, the UI is a straight mobile port and needs a total overhaul. It also demonstrates a lot of the annoyances of mobile games, such as constant rewards and notifications littered all over the UI pointing you to those rewards.\n\nIf you can look past some very serious issues, as stated above, the game is very enjoyable.",
      "Medium performance issues (as of 2/28/22) but GOTY game. This game is amazing and absolutely dripping with content. FromSoft didn't make Dark Souls 4. This game is Dark Souls 4, 5, and 6 all in one. Absolutely massive game and the open world part doesn't feel like an attempt to pad the game like most games, here's why:\n- Picking up items in the open world doesn't have a pickup animation. This might not seem like a lot but go play something like Dragon Age: Inquisition and you'll know what I'm talking about.\n- You can pick up items while on horseback (also no animation), Greatly speeds up looting while in the open world\n- Summoning pools makes getting summoned for bosses is easier than ever. All you have to do is be in the same general overworld location as a pool and all location get a summon sign\n- Sooooo many more bonfire locations. Can also fast travel from almost anywhere using the in-game map.\n- packed with stuff to do. Very rarely are you walking/riding for long periods before running into a dungeon/boss/camp/npc/etc. Every single side location has something to discover, Plus you never know what you're going to get and the feeling of discovery is unlike any other game out there.\n\nThere are a lot of improvements over previous installments as well. In no particular order, here are some of my standouts:\n- POWERSTANCING IS BACK BABYYYYY. Was always my favorite thing from DS2.\n- Slottable weapon arts. Taking the weapon art system from DS3 and making it even better. This system is also tied to the weapon affinity system which allows you to switch up the scaling of a weapon at any bonfire. No more committing to a specific element or stat.\n- The open world makes the game more accessible. Hit a wall with one zone? Just go somewhere else and come back when stronger. Sekiro had this a little but this game it's extremely pronounced.\n- The statues of Marika make it so the runbacks for bosses is not nearly as grueling. These statues work as \"respawn only\" bonfires that you can choose to respawn back at and are usually just outside a boss fight room after a lengthy run. You can't rest at them or adjust your build there, but they prevent the grueling runback and allow you to smash your face into a boss over and over with minimal downtime.\n- Having a dedicated jump button but keep the power of jump attacks. Risky usually, but can also be used as a counter to low swinging attacks. This also adds into the next system of...\n- Poise breaking enemies. Is done by heavy attacking, jump attacking and guard countering. Adds even more move types to the game and makes every weapon a totally different playstyle and adds to the replay value.\n- What are guard counters? After successfully blocking and attack, you can follow it up with a special heavy attack that has high poise damage. Allows for more critical hits. You might think this makes it easier but it takes more skill than you'd think to time these ripostes and it always feels good.\n\nAs with any game, it's not for everyone, but if you love souls games, you'd be doing yourself a disservice by missing this one. If you've never played a souls game, this is the best one to try. The most accessible by far. No crazy hard tutorial bosses, the new ashen summoning bell gives some great support in difficult areas, and the fact you can always leave harder fights and come back to them later makes it so you rarely run into situations where you know booting up the game means you're gonna be brick walling until either the boss dies or you give up.",
      "I knew Journey is a great game,maybe one of the best video games in history,but...\n\nI didn't know why so many people moved by such a simple gameplay.\nI didn't know why people had a Journey-Fever,even players just bought PS3 only for this game.\nI didn't know how close a relationship could be in 100mins only.\nI didn't know how bad i wished to go back to the peak and stay with my friend i'll never meet again.\n\nNow I Know.\n\n“It is better to walk with a friend in the dark than alone in the light” – Helen Keller\n\nIt was an interesting experience for me, I had never played this game nor heard of it until recently. I went and looked at the store page, My Brother/Friend Ethan-Winters Just Told Me this game in the steam store now, so went ahead and bought it. After buying it, went and started up the game some day later. Went into the game, saw another model character that looks like mine, I thought it was an AI because I had thought it was a single player game. So I decided to play along with it, we went through the story, it progressed quite fast, mainly because we both did not really bother to check out other things. The more I played, the more I realized that the guy I was playing with was most definitely not an AI, it was a genuine player. As we went through the story, our cooperation got smoother, we no longer have a solo player attitude, we would signal to each other, wait for each other and walked, fly with each other. It was smoothing, relaxing, a truly unique experience. Even with the setbacks we had throughout our progression, we never gave up, we stuck together from the desert till the end, when one of us screwed up, we patiently waited for the other, chiming to the person where we are. I remember at the end, when i screwed up a jump and did not see the other player, I was genuinely scared, sad, I frantically searched for the person but to no avail. I was distraught, sad and disappointed but I continued onward. When I went up, there he was, chiming for me, assuring me that he had not left yet. I felt happy, comforted when I saw the person waiting for me and together we finished the story. I am not one to do reviews, but it was such a unique experience among my years of gaming that I had to share it. Thank you, punks for the experience, truly thank you. And thank you, for bothering to read my review.\n\ni'll never forget our journey kind stranger.\n\nThis wasn't a game, it was an experience. I highly recommend you do this.",
      "Portal is a first person puzzle platformer where you are testing science with portals guided by GLaDOS.\n\nThe game is a classic for a reason. It uses portals as the main puzzle mechanic and combines other mechanics with the portals such as falling and gaining momentum to launch at a higher speed through the other portal. The levels gradually build up with complexity, but are never too frustrating and half of them are done with access to only a single portal. The puzzles have great visual clarity with the mostly white colors and decent visual cues on how it should all work out.\n\nPortal has the classic Valve way of telling stories, as things are already happening before you get there. You are woken up to follow instructions for the testing purposes of GLaDOS, but you are also figuring out if maybe there isn't a role better suited that could fit you. It's an enjoyable mystery leading you on without forcing it's way in.\n\nGoing back from Portal 2 to Portal made me aware of the improvements to the overall gameplay. Exiting through portals in Portal makes the camera rotate in a weird way sometimes and the levels are generally designed to be slower pace than what Portal 2 offers.\n\nIf there is one thing I didn't enjoy, it's the advanced and challenge levels. Figuring the harder puzzles is one part of the challenge, but executing them relied on tight timings where the puzzle mechanics they rely on felt too clunky to be fun.\n\nFor achievement hunters:\nTwo playthroughs are required with 2 sets of collectibles, one of which requires to be done in one go, a few challenges through the story and completing the advanced and challenge levels that can be console cheesed.

      "After sailing around for an hour or so, killing some huge crabs and collecting some reports from new islands I had discovered, I was running low on fuel and supplies. The game reminded me of this with a prompt titled \"Desperate Measures,\" so I was left with little choices on the matter.\n\n I tried to use my last two boxes of supplies in a vain attempt to desperately scrape together some fuel so I could reach the port of Fallen London -- I failed. Now I was faced with the problem of starvation, on top of the whole fuel fiasco. \n\n  Fear was setting in, as was hunger, fuel was low, as was hope, so I decided to beseech the gods of the Unter-Zee for help, and help they did. I was, for lack of a better word, teleported to some kind of temple dedicated to the gods, and that was where things went from bad to worse. \n  \n   This temple couldn't be further away from Fallen London, and therefore aid, than I could have gotten on my own. So I decided to beseech the gods again, this time my pleading went unanswered, a cruel cold-shoulder delivered to an ingrateful neophyte. The only purpose my inane begging to a higher power served was to unsettle my crew and drive us all to the brink of sanity.\n\nSo I abandoned ship and we all died, lol. 11/10.",
      "[h1]One of the few multiplayer games that reminds me that people can be amazing[/h1]\n\nI've been playing games for a long time, I've seen some sh*t. I've seen people crumble, I've lost friends, I've watched people eat each other even when they are winning. When people are supposed to be working together and yet they would rather treat their ally like trash because they refuse to take the blame for their own wrongdoing.\n\nSquad is a game in which I have seen true potential. A group of 40 individuals work together to plan, execute, and accomplish masterful plans to outsmart their enemy. I've seen teams rally from the depths of defeat and flip unwinable games into incredible victories. Heros emerging from the storm of mortars landing upon their bunker, to squad leaders risking their own lives to save those of their squad.\n\nSquad is not a game for the light hearted. To enjoy squad to the fulllest, you must communicate, work together, and form a bond with the soldiers at your side. You are a team, you are a unit, and you will never win alone. Be it a medic patching the wounds of your comrades, a logistics driver supplying your team with the supplies they need at the front line, or a squad leader putting the responsibility of 8 individuals on your shoulders, each person is a vital component of the team.\n\nFor this reason, Squad has now become my most played game on steam. The depth, the people, the comraderie, it's an amazing experience that no other game captures. I encourage you all to try it out on a free weekend as I originally did, I have been playing it ever since.\n\nI'll see you on the front line.",
      "People in the reviews don't understand this game.\n\n1. This is not Final Fantasy Tactics and it has a good reason for it.\n2. They barely removed any skills compared to the previous version and you will find most of those \"lost\" skills integrated into new skills or mechanics while certain broken mechanics were removed for a good reason. They also made things more challenging which i see as a welcome change. Things are also generally more viable and that is never a bad thing.\n3. You don't need to grind in this game, so why do i see people bring up grinding? Sure there's 40 weapon levels but in the endgame you get max level after like a couple battles if you really feel like you need to grind it out. In the previous version you had to level up a ton of different skills and some of them went up very slowly so there's actually a lot less grinding in this one.\n4. The reason you're struggling with doing damage is not because the game is bad, it's because you're not looking at what your equipment does or you don't understand it. The attack value in weapons is a base value which is used to penetrate your targets armor. It makes sense to do 1 damage against a person wearing heavy armor if you're firing an arrow at them. All the various boosts that you get in this game are applied to the damage you do AFTER you penetrate your targets armor. In order to do real damage to heavily armored targets you need to either use the right kind of weapon to attack them or make use of the new elemental system since now every character has an element that can be used to deal more damage OR you can simply apply a debuff to them since debuffs affect their defensive value directly. So yes this is not a game where you always win by rushing at your enemy and pressing attack. You have to understand how the game works and going through that process has been incredibly fun for me.\n5. You don't need to worry about those permanent stat gain cards or leveling your unit in a certain class to get the best possible stats. What you get from doing that isn't really going to make a difference if you're not playing well enough BUT if you really want to have a super powerful godlike unit, this game still allows it through those mechanics.\n6. The buff cards on the field are also not something you're required to make use of to beat the game, they're just there to make the battlefields more interesting and a way to make boss-characters stronger without directly cheating their stats.\n7. They removed random battles but you don't need random battles for anything because you can recruit units in the various long dungeons or simply go back in time to recruit a specific unit from any level in the postgame.\n\nIn summary it's a game that requires you to think a little bit but as you understand more you can also make things that seemed underwhelming at first viable because you found a way to make use of them. The story is also integrated into the gameplay so it's easy to keep interested in it especially since you get to make choices that affect both the story and gameplay. As a remake it definitely feels like they remade the game completely as it's so different from all the original versions. It's not for everyone and it doesn't have to be but hopefully the enjoyers of games like FFT or fire emblem will not dismiss this because of the reviews since this might become one of your favorite rpgs if you just bother to look into it without wanting it to be a cheap remake. It's too easy to jump into conclusions when we live in a world filled with terrible \"remakes\" popping up each year. This is all so ironic too as the spirit of this game when it comes to the story and gameplay alike is that you will never truly win by jumping into conclusions and there will always be something you didn't consider.\n\nUpdate: Replying to comments and addressing things for people who are familiar with the originals: \n\nI don't think they took away anything so vital that it would ruin the game. I can't really think of anything important other than the rogue class myself. You can call it removal but I'd rather say that they moved a lot of stuff to a different place from the list of skills and changed a lot of them to better fit the new card system and the new skill/spell limits. \n\nYes in my original review I didn't mention anything about the skill limit being reduced from 8 to 4. I think this change mostly just made the game easier to understand and when it comes to strategy I don't think anything was lost. You were going to use those extra 4 skill slots for things like strengthen or spellcraft either way and with the new scouting system moving around 8 skills before each encounter would probably be a little tedious (as it already feels tedious to setup units with the current system). \n\nAnd when it comes to spells, I simply can't understand why I would want to have access to more or all equipable spells as it would result in casters being a lot stronger than what they are supposed to be. This also makes each caster class more defined instead of them just being some kind of upgrades of each other so that a lategame class like the shaman can be a lot less useful in certain situations than your starting mage class because they don't have access to debuff spells but in return they hit super hard with their damaging spells.\n\nWhat else did they remove? They reworked the weird elemental system  into something that's always in play and I find this change very welcome as it adds another layer of strategy to the game especially through finishers and equipment bonuses even for non-spellcasters (but is still a little weird to get the hang of at first). They removed spell scrolls... yeah i probably dont have to mention why I see that as a good thing as well.\n\nAnd sure you can dislike these changes but we have to remember that steam reviews are black and white. Posting a negative review based on a subjective change is indistinguishable from saying \"this game is trash don't even look at it\" when it comes to statistics which is what everyone first sees when they open the store page of a game. \n\nI'm completely on the same page with you about playing your own favorite version, whatever you prefer and I myself would like to mess around more with things like One Vision in the future. But imo giving this game a negative review is also bad for the reputation of other versions of tactics ogre.\n\nAnd ofc the game is definitely not perfect there's still imbalances and some skills are pretty underwhelming compared to what they used to be (RIP Rampart shadows...). But imo this is better than what I've seen from literally any other game remake ever so I simply can't agree with calling it a bad remake.",
      "Firstly, neutral reviews should be a thing. Because although the game's story is pretty solid (and some elements of it still very relavant even today), the game suffers from a multitude of issues, so no, I don't truly recommend this game because of those factors. Rockstar themselves should be fixing the broken state of the game, instead of leaving it to people to fix it.\n\nThe problem with this game is that you need to be online to be even able to play it. You NEED to be online to PLAY a SINGLEPLAYER game FROM 2009. I don't know what Rockstar was thinking when they force you to play online, but this is just not okay. There is no online functionality for the game besides maybe cloud saves - something steam cloud could've done just as fine instead of leaving it to their own messy launcher.\n\nBut that's not the only problem with this game. Being that it's an old game, it does not run well on modern systems, not anymore. It suffers from various performance issues. Thankfully, you can use DXVK to get around this problem - but as i said earlier, you shouldnt HAVE TO do this. Rockstar could have easily patched the game to fix the performance issues (that still happen with DXVK mind you - but compared to without DXVK it is MUCH better), instead they focused on patching who knows what.\n\nExcept after you use DXVK, you HAVE to edit a game file to let the game use more than 2 gb of ram. Again, SOMETHING Rockstar could've easily done by updating the game's code to meet the modern standards. Nobody has specs like the one in the minimum recommend anymore. After you do that, you HAVE to edit the amount of vram the game detects by using a command line to fix it. That's already 3 things you have to deal with JUST to be even able to play the game normally.\n\nSome people may see this as a small botherance - some people may see it as a huge inconvenience, but the apparent problem with this is that, once again, you SHOULDNT HAVE TO do all of this. Going past those issues and playing the game, you also have to ensure you limit the fps to 60, either using DXVK or the in game vsync (former being more recommendable as it doesn't hog as much as cpu power). If you decided to bother with all of those steps to make the game playable, congratulations. Now be severely annoyed like I did  because Rockstar has not, for all this time, patched the final mission with the helicopter QTE. One suggested fix for it was to limit the FPS to 60 - which did NOT help me. Other was to install a script file to fix it, which ALSO failed at first, till I tried again like 5-6 times. You as a player should not have to install this stuff and edit games just to fix the game, when the publisher themselves should be doing it. I expect a game to be supported if it's still being sold on Steam. And don't think they don't care about the games being on Steam - they clearly cared when they removed the classic gta trilogy from Steam (which were also left in even more of a broken state compared to how they first came out - but that is an entirely different point).\n\nPutting all of those factors aside, the game itself is very solid, story wise. I really loved all of the symbolism that was apparent throught the game, and concepts such as \"American Dream\" or \"Land of Oppurtunity\" being presented as something that was clearly flawed - which is precisely why people like Nico go down the path of killing people or doing drugs just to survive. You can't go from rags to riches in a \"strong eat the weak\" country - you either do whatever it is you have to do - like Nico - to survive, or you let yourself and your close ones get killed. There are other things the game criticizes as well, like that one conversation where Nico criticizes the food in the city for using \"chemicals that your body spends time getting it off your system\", or something along those lines. I don't think I need to mention that this isn't something they added as a joke, because it is very much there. The game's serious and dark tone might be considered bad by people, but it is because of this dark tone and seriousness that we can actually learn some lessons from it and open our eyes to some truths in our lives.\n\nThe gameplay itself isn't really that complicated, except when it comes to driving the vehicles in the game. They are based on a realistic driving system and although it is debatable how much of a good gaming experience it really is when they made it so realistic, since it introduces a huge learning curve and can end up frustrating the player, I actually ended up loving it for what it is, except when it came to driving motorcycles of any form. The game's simplicity in other regards is what makes it pretty good, in my eyes. Though it sometimes doesn't work the way you think it would (like when you are playing with a controller and have to use auto aim), it is nevertheless solid enough that those are only minor inconveniences and not the kind of problem where you'd want to stop playing the game.\n\nThis game definitely deserves more attention and love - but Rockstar really needs to fix this game themselves if they are still keeping it on Steam's store, because the current situation of the game is not acceptable.\n\n",
      "[h1]Prelude[/h1]\n\nWorld's Dawn is relaxing/life simulation game. While it's inspired by Harvest Moon series (probably FoMT, BtN or other's  before 2004), farming isn't the core gameplay of this game. It's developed since 2010 with RPG Maker VX, so personally i wouldn't compare this game with other game which have higher price or far bigger development budget.\n\n\n[h1]Story/Character[/h1]\n\nThe main story of World's Dawn is similar with Harvest Moon series before 2004. You move to a village with goal saving the the village. To progress the main story, basically you need to do 5 things such as farming, friendship & romance. While the main story isn't outstanding, it's better than i expected for Life/Farming Sim game.\n\nSugar Blossom Village has fair amount of lore & festival. There are few interesting secrets waiting to be discovered with OKish reward. The festivals are very fun & enjoyable, it's unique experience that i don't get on many Life/Farming Sim game. There are 4-5 festivals on each season to keep you engaged, although 2 of them are market festival.\n\nThere are 24 characters in this game, with 8 more as you progress the story. Each character are unique with decent writing. Each of them has decent amount of conversation lines for many occasion (take a walk with your dog, after marriage proposal, before/after festival, about new villagers, etc.). It's best part of World's Dawn, although i hardly can remember their name.\n\n\n[h1]Visual/Audio[/h1]\n\nEach character has lovely art style. I like it since doesn't lean too much towards cutesy/anime artstyle which is common on today's Farming Sim game. Most marriage candidate also have 4 different portraits depending on the season, which is nice addition.\n\nThe general visual of the game feels dull though, even considering it's RPGMaker game. It fares better during Winter & some festival though. Each season also looks quite different, so it's far more than simple reskin. Animal need better sprite/animation though.\n\nThe soundtrack is decent & it doesn't feel boring hearing it many times. Each seasons & some area have it's own soundtrack, although it's something you'd expect from Farming Sim game. The audio effect/SFX is only average though. On a side note, i also wish each marriage candidate has a bit more voice acting.\n\n\n[h1]General gameplay[/h1]\n\nWorld's Dawn core gameplay isn't farming, there are so many things you could do (fishing, mining, social interaction, etc.). I'd say World's Dawn is a bit of everything. The game offer little progression though, so the gameplay feel stale after 2 seasons. Combining that & linear story, this game has no replayability value.\n\nThe control is easy to learn, although little awkward. But due to limitation of RPG Maker engine, you can't rebind any action. While there are 2 free hotkey for item, you only can bind shovel & watering can. It makes barn work rough.\n\nI also experience few bugs. None of those are game breaking, but could annoy you. Here are few that i could remember,\n> Few achievement not unlocked on Steam\n> Some items sometimes not shown on inventory if you spam button up/down/enter/back\n> 99 maximum item quantity, where additional item you obtained simply gone. I proved it by through item shipping & cooking\n\n\n[h1]Game mechanics[/h1]\n\nThis section review each game mechanics in more detail. Here's rough meaning of sign that i use in this section,\n> (+) Positive, neat game mechanics or i like the game mechanics\n> (*) Neutral, average, acceptable or what i expect from Life Sim/Farming Sim game\n> (-) Negative, poor game mechanic or i hate the game mechanic\n\n[b]Energy[/b]. (*) First of all, running deplete your energy. (-) At beginning of game, you only have small energy capacity  so you can't do all tasks. There are many ways to replenish your energy in this game. (-) Consuming food/beverage is rather useless/costly, (*) while resting on bench is fine option only when you have time to spare. (+) But hot spring restore 100% energy which only took 20 minutes (once per day). (+) It's really powerful mechanic after energy capacity is increased. (*) You can use Eden Fruit to permanently increase your energy, (+) where you can obtain all of them within first 2 seasons.\n\n[b]Farming[/b]. Just like most Farming Sim game, there are 4 seasons with different crops for each seasons. (*) Your farmland is limited to 40 tiles & possible upgrade only give 12 additional tiles. (*) There are only 3 crops for each season, excluding Wheat which can be planted on any season. (*) Initially your watering can only can water 1 tile at a time, but later you can get upgrade which water 3x3 tile. (+) The upgrade could be obtained with small amount of coin & watering few hundred tiles which could be obtained quickly.\n\n[b]Animal[/b]. (*) You can have 5 types of animal: Chicken, Cow, Horse, Dog & Cat. (*) For first 3 animal, there's nothing much to do besides feed, interact, brush and bring them outside. (+) You just need to ring bell to bring all livestock inside/outside though, which is convenient. (+) Dog is quite helpful, you can send him on errand & bark on spot which contain an item. (*) The cat only act cute though.\n\n[b]Fishing[/b]. (+) While fishing is also good way to earn coin, (-) it has really poor mechanic/balance. (*) It takes an hour to fish, where you only can get one fish with initial tool (Fishing Rod). (-) After you upgrade your Fishing Rod into Landing Net, the mini game isn't changed where you must hook one fish at a time. (-) Finally, you need to spend 20 hours to get 1st upgrade & 70 hours to get 2nd upgrade. I really don't like this since each upgrade let you catch larger variety of fish.\n\n[b]Mining[/b]. It's quite simple, you destroy stone, get raw gemstones & refine it to jewels. The cave only has 5 depth where lower depth has better drop rate/quality. (+) It's really powerful way to earn coin, especially after pickaxe upgrade & increase maximum energy. (*) RNG is involved to determine which raw gemstones & jewel you get. (*) But since 2 process use RNG, there's small possibility you're very lucky & vice versa.\n\n[b]Cooking[/b]. Basically i find it's unwelcoming. (-) You could miss chance to buy 3 out of 4 cooking utensils from TV program. (-) The next chance is either next year or festival on Fall/Winter. (*) Finding recipe also take some time, coin, effort or trial-and-error (only for mixture). (-) Many recipes (excluding mixture) need lots of ingredients where some of them only available on certain season, where i barely cook anything until Fall.\n\n[b]Social interaction[/b]. (*) Giving item is fastest way to increase villager favorability. (+) The good thing is the game has manual which list what each character likes, although you need to find out their favorite item by yourself. (+) You also can talk to them, join certain festival & take part time jobs to increase their favorability.\n\n[b]Other[/b].\n> (+) There's TV in your house which gives some useful information, (*) although you only can see tomorrow weather forecast from 6 PM onward\n> (*) To see list of festival, you need to buy calendar or see someone's else at their home\n> (*) There's no portable map, so you have to remember village environment or going to sign which show village map\n> (+) Clothing has some impact on gameplay, (*) although the description is somehow confusing\n> (*) LockBall control is somehow awkward & locking mechanic is confusing, (+) although it's fun for me\n> (+) Event-specific mini games is short, but fun while it's lasted\n> (*) Foraging is just average, but has decent importance on this game\n> (+) No tedious item management, everything is stored on your knapsack\n\n\n[h1]Closure[/h1]\n\nWhile i have some criticism on the gameplay, the story & character are best part of World's Dawn. I find this game very fun for first 2.5 seasons & quite fun for later 1.5 seasons. If you're looking for relaxing game with good character/story & unpunishing gameplay, you'll like this game.\n\nP.S. **** 8K char limit!",

      "Tentative review of game in progress, but so far it is amazing and I had to leave a review in support of it.  As far as the game itself goes, I'm giving it a 9/10.  As far as the port goes, the lack of keyboard input prompts seems frustrating when they already have the ability to change between xbox and ps4 buttons, but I use a controller and expect most will for this, but it's worth mentioning in the sake of fairness and accuracy.  There is a certain graphics setting called \"effects\" with high and low.  High is causing major fps drops under certain conditions even on a pc with an rtx 3080 and a 5800x cpu.  Devs have acknowledged it and are working on improving it.  Other than these issues though, no problems at all.  Online play has been smooth and i haven't experienced any disconnects.  The game itself has only crashed once in 93 hours, but that was also during excessive alt tabbing while the game was in true fullscreen mode, and it crashed on an alt-tab itself, so I'm not really blaming the game on that one given it was the only time.  Again, overall the game is playing great and I have no problems with it on a functional level as well as an entertainment level, I just want to be as fair and accurate as I can, and these were really the only problems I could find with it.",

      "After around an hour and a half of bad spawns, scarce resources, and short-lived ventures into the more inhabited areas of the map, I ran into the first friendly player I had met in Rust. I had initially spotted him pretty far away, but I paid no real notice to him as he had a rock equipped. Eventually he got close enough for us to clearly see each other and, upon the realization that neither of us were hostile, we both pulled out torches as a mutual sign of peace (or the highest possible level of non-aggression that can exist in Rust). I dropped my old hatchet for him as I had just finished crafting one with metal, and he gave me some food as a sign of good faith. After nearly 30 minutes of searching and scavenging, we had pooled enough resources to craft us each some minimally decent gear. We knew that if we wanted to progress any further we would need to mine boulders, and a lot of them. I used what remaining materials we had to put together a 9mm handgun and several bullets, though I reminded him it was only in case we really needed it. I had decided earlier during my many unwanted experiences with bullets to the face that I would try my hardest not to run around slaughtering every newly spawned player that I came across. A few minutes out from camp we had encountered a player with a hunting bow. I had been running with my hatchet out, so I quickly took out the handgun in my inventory and pointed it in his direction, attempting to scare him away. When the player was far enough away we continued up a road towards a few stones. The area was surrounded by trees so I opted to stand guard with the handgun while my friend mined. Just as we were moving on to the next boulder, I heard the gunfire start. I turned around to see a player with an assault rifle gunning down my friend, and before I could land any shots on him he had already begun shooting me. It was at that moment that I remembered I hadn't even crafted a sleeping bag for the camp, as that was one of the objectives of the trip we were taking. I typed into the chat, thanking the friend I had made for all of his help and asking the player who had killed us if we had been intruding in his area or something along those lines. He simply wrote \"Sorry guys :D\" This is the single problem that I have with games like this. Why does it have to be \"shoot-on-sight?\" That player had obviously taken us by surprise and was better equipped than us. Even if he had a justifiable reason for approaching two very poorly equipped players (which he really didn't considering we were in the middle of the woods and he had pretty much all of the gear you could need in this game) he could have easily told us to cooperate by either putting away our weapons or just leaving the area. But of course, he comes around, sees some players trying to gather enough supplies to get to a stable point in the game, and decides to go out of his way to approach us and use unecessary ammo for a hatchet and a handgun with four bullets. Then, to add even more of an insult, he adds an apology at the end, as if he had no choice but to shoot two unexpecting, half-naked, unprepared players. \n\nAll in all, though, I do see a lot of potential in this game, and the good in the community does shine through every once in a while. I just wish that people would realize that they don't need to go around killing players who haven't had the chance to experience the game. People like that are the single reason why so many players on steam feel that they wasted money on what would otherwise be a great experience.",
      "Falcom's Action RPG Masterpiece.\n\nbest story in the series. it follows the latest adventure of Adol and his companions, stranded in an island and slowly uncovering their secrets. the tight, but well developed cast are absolutely the best written characters in the series. from party member to your fellow castaways all have developed motivation, personality and charm. \n\nalot of the horribad translation and voice acting have been fixed, and it finally got the treatment it deserve as a masterpiece. \n\nthe gameplay is an evolution of the modern Ys game. at its core, ys 8 is an action RPG where you control adol and several other party members with unique set of skills, moveset, weapons and super attack. each character represent an attack type (slash, pierce, smash) that are pitted against various enemies with certain weaknesses. great variety of enemies, amazing boss battles, music and story. \n\non release, there seems to be a big problem for the port, but as far as i know, everything has been patched to very good level of stability. over 70 hours, the game crashed twice (and saved by the intuitive autosave system), run flawlessly 60 FPS and 1440p without a single slowdown. \n\n10/10 game go buy so we get monstrum nox on PC.",

      "Launch controversy aside, what this game should have been called for the longest time is 'Early Access'. Around the time of the Beyond update is when I'd say would have been the true 'launch'. \n\nI didn't get this when it first came out, but even when I did it was a fragmented mess of a game. Now, finally, with the Beyond and Synthesis updates there's a solid game here that's almost (but not quite) like what Sean Murray promised way back at the beginning.\n\nPerformance on PC has dramatically improved with the switch over to the Vulkan API, and it finally supports Ultrawide and various other PC-specific options. The game itself provides a significant amount of variety, offering a combination of Elite-lite and 'Minecraft in Space' mechanics. There's plenty to see and do, and the exploration aspect is enjoyable - if a little bland. The planetary biomes and overall game could still do with further diversity, but there's plenty here to get to your teeth into.\n\nHello Games show no sign of slowing down their support for the game either, having just recently released a bizarre in-game music synthesizer of all things, and going by the evidence of their progress to date I can only see the game improving further as time moves on.\n\nEDIT - 24/09/2020 \"Origins\" Patch: well, you can ignore the previous comments about diversity being a bit on the low side. They already added things like living ships, derelicts, space creatures and robots since I made this review, and with the Origins patch the variety of experience on offer is on such a scale now that I don't think I'm going to be lacking for things to do for some time. Also, impressively, the game runs even better than it did when I originally posted this - and the rejigged UI looks fantastic on Ultrawide. \n\nBrilliant work by the team at Hello Games. I can't think of any game I've played (and I've been indulging since the late 80's) where I've ever gone from \"I can't stand this\" to \"this is one of my favourite games\". It's taken a while to get here, but No Man's Sky is definitely one of the greats.",
      "[b]Playing status:[/b] 100% achievement\n[b]Grindy Achievement(s):[/b] No.\n[b]Optional Achievement(s):[/b] Yes (9 achievements).\n[b]Difficult Achievement(s):[/b] No.\n\n[h1]Intro[/h1]\nYou were sure that you weren't supposed to be here: a dark forest with a thick mist surrounding over it. Where is this place? Can you go back? Join Kihara Kashin in her adventure, looking for a way to return to where she belongs in [b]Tales of the Black Forest[/b].\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n- Heartwarming stories\n- 2 endings\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n- Dialogues might be hard to understand with the untranslated words and a lot of Japanese names that are given at once\n\n[b]Specs[/b]\nIntel Core i5-9300H 2.40GHz, 8GB RAM, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650\n\n[h1]Should you buy this game?[/h1]\n[b]Yes.[/b]\n[i]If you like to play games with a heartwarming story and don't mind reading a lot of texts, buy this game. You might want to familiarize yourself with Japanese terms though.[/i]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1]In-Depth Review[/h1]\n\n[h3]Visuals[/h3]\nThe game is presented in 2D pixelated art. As an RPG Maker game, all of its assets and interfaces have been customized, leaving no trace of the default one. It does a good job with the interface though - everything looks beautifully made and straight to the point. The maps are also done well to promote the areas, whether it's the bustling city or the abandoned village. The areas, although usually depicted at night, are still easy to see with their blue-ish colors. Everything is done well to help you enjoy the scenery.\n\n[h3]Story[/h3]\nThe main selling point of the game is in its storytelling. The world of [b]Tales of the Black Forest[/b] is separated into 3 interconnecting chapters, each focusing on someone and the event that was happening around them. The story has a different vibe on each chapter, although one thing is certain: it does a good job in delivering a heartwarming story at the end. I know that creating good storytelling with just 2D sprites is not easy, but this game does it seamlessly.\n\nSince the storytelling focuses on a different person in each chapter, the story is obviously non-linear. You'll find some clues of what was happening to a certain event, which will help you in understanding another event in a bigger picture. It might be hard to keep track of all of them, especially with the recurring names, but the game is kind enough to give you some explanation about it. There might still be some mysteries lying around, but I found it to be concluded nicely at the end.\n\nThe translation might hinder you from enjoying the story to its fullest. It tends to not translate some words, whether it's some locations or simple terms. Some words like \"komusume-chan\" can be translated into English nicely without ruining the sentences, but the translator decides to just give a translation note surrounded in brackets when you encounter it for the first time. People who do not know Japanese terms might have trouble understanding these words sometimes, especially when you also have to remember a lot of Japanese names in the process.\n\n[h3]The Game[/h3]\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nAlthough the story is the main focus of the game, there were times when you have to walk around, whether to initiate another cutscene or solve some puzzles. Important objects are marked in the game, making it easier to locate where you are supposed to look. If you are the adventurer type, some additional dialogues will also available to give a conclusion to some characters after you progress the story. They are not related to the main story though, so you can safely ignore them if you choose to do so.\n\nSeveral puzzles are available to break the repetitiveness. Puzzles in the first half of the game usually take the form of finding some number combinations based on the provided hints, although the second half of the game starts to be more creative with its puzzle-like minigame. I wish that the game will do these puzzles right from the start since it helps to break the monotonous pace.\n\n[b]Length and Replayability[/b]\nThe game lasts for about ~5h. Despite it having two endings, the point of no return is obvious and the game is kind enough to tell what you have to do to reach both endings. That being said, there is no point to replay the game since you can save before the point of no return to unlock both endings at once.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nIt's been a while since I found a quality RPG Maker game on Steam. I didn't expect that it will do a good job with its storytelling. The music, art, and dialogue - everything helps to enhance the story, giving this heartwarming feeling after you read it. I was satisfied with the story, although I admit that I got bored sometimes because of the number of dialogues that I had to read. The game is completely not for those who don't like visual novels, and people who appreciate the story aspect in a game will enjoy it to the fullest.\n\n[quote]Visit SaveOrQuit.com for detailed game reviews, posted daily![/quote]",
      "I genuinely had no expectations with Odyssey. Assassins Creed died along with Desmond for me. However, I was truly blown away with positivity for this installment of the series. Odyssey reminds me and takes a page from the Witcher 3. It's incredibly enjoyable and in my opinion more superior and engaging than Origins. That said, I couldn't get into Origins it wasn't for me.\n\nI've been a Assassins Creed fan ever since the first game. Over the years the game has evolved, adapted, and improved on every aspect up to Black Flag. I didn't feel the need to play the future installments after Black Flag. In my opinion they didn't fit in the mold of the series and I didn't support the actions Ubisoft were taking with the title. Odyssey changed my perspective on that with its fresh ideas and made me believe that a different direction isn't a bad one.\n\nI still miss my boy Ezio :(",

People who have problems with flashing lights should avoid this game since the game isn't as good as it is with some options turned off.[/i]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1]In-Depth Review[/h1]\n\n[h3]Visuals[/h3]\nThe developer spends a lot of effort crafting beautiful, quality cutscenes. Some scenes show the beauty of the night sky while others show what the main character is feeling from close range. Food images look so carefully made that I couldn't believe that it was a pixelated image at first. Every scene does a good job in supporting the story, combined with the relaxing music that is running in the background.\n\nBlurry effects are applied on the screen, whether it's just to make a certain area stand out or create a cool-looking effect for the cutscenes. The game relies on a lot of transitions in its cutscenes, some can leave you shocked with the inverted images and flashes of red colors at intense moments. People that have problems with these can soften the red color in the option with the downside of making the scene to be less effective. Moreover, since the option affects all red colors in the game, some scenes will look weird with the faded color.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441881358 \n\n[h3]Story[/h3]\nThe story is a relaxing one, set in a place where people are helpful and empathetic to your actions. Every character gives a positive vibe through their attitude and kindness, supporting you whenever you are down or helping you to enjoy the moment. Reading the interaction between characters warm my heart, especially when accompanied by the relaxing music that is playing in the background.\n\nThe storytelling is wonderfully done with the combination of visuals and music to let you drown in the story. Sometimes, an intense moment kicks in, changing the scenery into one full of effects and transitions. The fast-paced music also helps to set the mood with its upbeat tone, increasing the intensity. The ending is told in a similar manner, although instead of an intense moment, it crafts a touching scene instead that is fit for an ending. Some people will find a small part of the ending not to make any sense, although luckily, it won't affect the overall experience.\n\n[h3]The Game[/h3]\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nThe game is focused on reading memories of an object to progress. Your hidden ability to read an object's memory by touching it will help you to solve various tasks, ranging from looking a lost object to finding a hidden area. There are some limitations though - some objects have no memories that you can read while other objects can't be interacted with until they are discovered. Fortunately, they are quite easy to discover as long as you spam the space button and/or pay attention to the dialogues.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441881785 \n\n[b]Puzzles and Minigames[/b]\nThe rest of the gameplay is focused on the usual adventure games where you have to pick up items and use them to pass through the area. Most problems that you will have to solve has the same theme as the building you are in. It's nice to see how puzzles are related to the corresponding area while still being unique at the same time.\n\nMost puzzles and minigames are easy to solve except for a select few. I found the last one to be the trickiest because not only does it cover a huge area, but it also requires you to use the mechanic from a previous area, something which never happened in other puzzles. It's still easy to solve as long as you are attentive enough, but if you happen to get stuck, the game offers subtle hints in the form of memories that you can read.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2441883206 \n\n[b]Length and Replayability[/b]\nI finished the game in 9.7h after experiencing all the bad endings. Although the game only offers one manual save slot, it has an extra checkpoint slot that you can load before the story branches off. A hidden secret can also be found after you finished the game, which might take a long time to find due to its randomness. I found it to be a waste of time though, especially since there isn't much that you can learn from the secret. You'll also be left with more questions than answers, giving more reason not to look for them unless if you are an achievement hunter or the curious type.\n\n[b]Problems[/b]\nDespite the game requires you to restart the game several times, you can't skip the cutscenes. Some parts of the game will lead you to a bad ending and the unskippable cutscenes can take a significant amount of time if you don't know how to bypass it. Moreover, checkpoints tend to be placed minutes before the story branches off, wasting more of your time. Lastly, the game isn't very clear whenever it autosaves your game. I had to save manually whenever I took a break from the game because of this.\n\n[h1]Specs[/h1]\nIntel Core i5-9300H 2.40GHz, 8GB RAM, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nThe game has a lot of elements that complement each other. The nice-looking visuals, the calm and relaxing music that can heat up in intense moments, the superb effect - everything blends well to make the story stands out. The detailed cutscenes are done well to capture the emotion that can't be portrayed with a simple portrait and character animation, while portraits are expressive enough to handle simple expressions. The game is designed with quality in mind and although it can be slow sometimes, the relaxing music helps you to savor the moment.\n\n[quote]This game was reviewed with a key provided by the developer for free through [url=https://discord.gg/xc22zZP]Reviewers' Paradise[/url], a group that connects both developers and reviewers in one place[/quote]\n\n[quote]Visit SaveOrQuit.com for detailed game reviews, posted daily![/quote]",

Each stories of the main spirits are well written and realistically human. The endings are top notch too.\n\nIf you’re even considering playing it… play it… I promise you won’t regret it. I was much more emotionally invested in this game than I was on Hollow Knight. Lilly is an amazing protagonist… and she never even utters a word. She doesn’t have to.\n\nIt's a beautiful game with fun combat, awesome art and amazing music. My only real complaint was a bit of exploration fatigue having to go around finding all the collectibles. \n\nI think the easiest way to sum up Ender Lilies is \"It's Momodora, but better.\" It has the same gameplay loop of \"slash slash roll behind the enemy slash slash repeat\" and fairly challenging bosses, in a much bigger and more non-linear world with nearly every single room having some sort of collectible. It's also aesthetically atmospheric and pleasing, and the soundtrack is great.\n\nI can safely say that this game is a creative masterpiece. And in the end… Like Lilly, don’t we all have a little girl inside of us, telling us to stop all this silliness and go back to being the proper good boys our Mother wanted us to be?\n\n10/10",

      "I'll make this quick.\n\nThis game has been amazing fun so far.\n\nLiving in a clan is definitely a unique thing for farming sims, and it even helps with the gameplay. You're not working for yourself in Roots of Pacha - you're working for the betterment of your tribe. The better you do, the better everyone does and visa versa. \n\nI love exploring to find new seeds, herbs, animals and materials... I actually find myself staying up until nearly 2am in game almost every day because of that. \n\nThe npcs seem to be an interesting bunch too, but I have to say that I've yet to see many events with them. This is something that I'm looking forward to though because the writing has been enjoyable so far too. \n\nIts my opinion that if you're an enjoyer of \"cozy\" games like Animal Crossing, Stardew Valley, Coral Island and  others like them, you'll likely enjoy Roots of Pacha as well. I've been telling my friends they should check it out.",
      "[h1]SMOOTH RIDING WITH A FEW BUMPY ROADS[/h1]\n\nFirst off, I am going to get this out of the way. If you are planning to buy this game and wondering which version to get, ask yourself this. If you are a minimalist, standard is fine. If you want the expansions, get ultimate. Deluxe on the other hand I think is worth skipping entirely. If $99.99 is too much for you for Ultimate, just wait for a sale. Ultimate is definitely my choice for recommendation. The amount of content you get is impressive and worth the price of admission. \n\nForza Horizon 4 is a car collector's dream, with a roster of over 700 cars (with Ultimate). And also a racing enthusiasts dream playground with a decently sized map with tons of racing variety and events to play around with. I have tons of racing games on Steam personally, and none have held my interest as much as Forza Horizon 4. It's a shame though that this came so late to Steam. But even still, I got my money's worth with over 120 hours of playtime at the time of writing this. \n\nIs Forza Horizon 4 perfect though? Sadly, it is not. The Steam version is hampered with some unfortunate bugs. People may experience random crashes, which while not happening often after the last few updates, still do happen, as this game is a few versions behind the Microsoft store's own version. Something I don't know if will ever be fully fixed. Also online racing can be hit or miss with issues. Those issues usually lie in the wait times sadly, so it might be offputting for those looking to race with others. Luckily there is more than enough content without having to do online races to keep most people happy. \n\n I'm still giving this a recommend regardless of that issue, just because more often than not, the game does run smoothly. \n\nIf you happen to just get the standard version of the game you get access to the main map which is a caricatured version of Great Britain, which includes many race events ranging from your standard street races, dirt tracks and even full blown off road events. There are also other events which include speed traps, drifting, massive jumps, promotional events (like racing the Halo Warthog, racing against trains, and more), and some cool little story events like racing for Top Gear, or even opening your own businesses. There's plenty of content for sure. If you decide to get the expansions, you get other maps, including Fortune Island, which is, well, an Island, complete with both low and high altitude locations, lots of off roading, some impressive night time visuals (Aurora Borealis anyone?), and more. You also get the Lego Speed Champions map which is a fun and impressively designed map based on the Lego toys which features it's own variety of fun and unique settings, including a beach riddled with pirate ships, a haunted lighthouse, a stunt arena, and more. Also it gets it's own radio station that plays just 1 song on loop. If you guessed that song is \"Everything is Awesome\", you'd be right, Both expansions also come with a unique way of progression and their own vehicles to collect. Fortune Island will have you progress to unlock a variety of treasure hunts, that each unlock 1 million credits, and the Lego expansion has you doing different tasks to collect studs which can be used to build your house and also collect new cars. Both expansions will also include a majority of the types of events you will be used to in the base game, with their own unique flair. \n\nWith 700 cars luckily there is enough variety for anyone. But for those looking for more, you can custom tune each vehicle to your own liking, with a variety of parts and overhauls, including full blown engine swaps. For those who are not gear heads, the community has you covered and you can even download custom tunes from others. Forza Horizon 4 is one of the most generous racing games I have ever played with the sheer amount of cars they dump on you. You can win cars from events. You can win cars from wheelspins. you can win cars from leveling up. You can win cars from performing certain tasks. You can win cars from barn finds, which are like little treasure hunts. You can also buy cars from both an auto show, or take your chances at an in game auction house, which is also a great way to make money, to well, buy more cars. Basically, Horizon does not let you down with the cars. It's like Pokemon for car lovers. And once you have that dream car, don't forget to give it that unique look. Most cars can have some visual parts swapped out, ranging from spoilers to bumpers and more, and you can add custom designs to the paint jobs too. Want to race around in Jurassic Park Jeep? Want to race around in the Bandit 1 from Smokey and the Bandit? Forza has you covered. And if you just want to look at the cars in all their glory, Forza also has a nice little feature called Forzavista which allows to do things with your car like opening and closing doors, and for some vehicles you can open up trunks and hoods and look inside at the engines. If you get the James Bond pack, you can even look at those nifty little gadgets like the machine guns mounted to some of the Bond vehicles. Pretty neat stuff. \n\nAt the end of the day, is Forza Horizon 4 worth it? I'd say yes.",
      "TL;DR: This game didn't receive a similar love and praise than Undertale because potato. Play it.\n\n------\n\nIf you're reading this, I already like you and I already think you have a good taste in videogames.\n\nOneShot is one of those little surprises you might have heard of but always keep pushing onto your backlog, assuming other games should have more priority. Eventually I decided to try it out and it took just a few minutes to regret all those delays.\n\nIt is extremely hard to give you some useful information about OneShot without spoiling the heck out of it. You start the game in a dark, small bedroom where the main character (Niko) simply wakes up. That's it. By simply walking around and interacting with elements you soon get some clue of the mechanics that will be present through the whole game and how to progress. \n\nAnd you will also see why this game is special. \n\nWhat the game attempts is probably not new to you. It has constant elements of surprise but many other titles (Undertale as the easiest example) have done so too. When the idea is saturated, it gets harder to eventually fulfill its purpose and, well, surprise the player. \n\nOneShot is the game that will surprise you no matter what. \n\nThrough a simplistic but engaging plot, amazing and memorable soundtrack, and interesting dialogues you'll get yourself into a journey you won't regret. I wish I could give you more details but like many other reviews here, I feel like I would ruin the experience for you. The best I can do is to assure you that you will easily feel like us: that this title is an incredible gem and that you will feel bad for giving it a chance so late.",

      "I bought the game and the mechanics are fun! The battle system is super impactful and just FEELS fun. It really gives you a sense of satisfaction. And it has interesting elements that really every game should have... but the UI sucks, the classes are genderlocked, and there are so many systems going on at once it's annoying. Like something as simple as a constant notification in the middle of the screen of some other person or random guild you know nothing about doing quests or getting skill points. It's a fun game, but has WAAAY too many minor (except genderlocked classes. Genderlock is never a minor thing) problems that just add up making it annoying to play",
      "It's criminal that a team of 5 people can build such an amazing game like this and sell it for $20.\n\nI continue to be amazed at the thought that went into this game and all the little details. From the changing weather, the waves in the ocean, the ebb and flow of the water along shorelines, the smoke from the campfire as it fills the room, the ease and simplicity when it comes to building, the way the trees fall, the music that feels seamless and relaxing, and so on.\n\nI truly appreciate that they didn't make an \"open world simulation that simulates things for no other reason than to simulate them\". Made a mistake while building that house? No worries, just remove it and get all your materials back. Ran out of food while busy building or crafting? No worries, you're not going to die from hunger. Broke your axe? No worries, just repair it. Troll smashed your cart full of ore? No worries, just put down a workbench and rebuild the cart and put everything back in the cart.",

      "I love the Disgaea series (I've owned every game).  I gladly paid full price when it initially came out on PS2.  As the years have gone by, release after release, I find that the core game is pretty much the same.  With that said, these iterative approaches should by no means be priced at what they are.  I'd be semi OK to buy these at $40.  For such a niche genre, the price needs to be more accessible for folks to really want to get into it.\n\nI liked my short time with it, but I'd only recommend it at half price.  Thumbs down for price, which outweighs the thumbs up for a good game.",

      "This is half of a very good game. You might be impressed in the first 10 hours, but after that it becomes evident you are playing the skeleton of what could be a generational game. Here is some of the good and some of the bad.\n\nThe Good:\n-Graphics look great, even on lower settings\n-Decently varied battle maps\n-Sound design makes killing blows feel amazing\n-Decent variety of weapons\n\nThe Bad:\n-Extremely shallow \"campaign\"\n-Almost zero role playing elements. Every character behaves identically towards you. Even your own wife will try to introduce herself. Kill someone's father/brother/entire clan? They will never mention it and will behave towards you just like anyone else.\n-\"Realistic mode\" means all your enemies will be absolute tank meat sponges while you are made of glass.\n-After you get your first settlement the game becomes extremely tedious. You will play whack a mole with enemy armies who take almost no time to recuperate. Wipe out 3 enemy armies in a massive, \"war changing battle\"? Oops, looks like all of those armies are back to full strength in a matter of days.\n-Almost zero variation of playstyles. Sure you can be a trader or a rogue mercenary for the early game, but you will always end up cheesing the smithing economy mechanics to support the larger armies you need in the mid game\n\nThis is simply an unfinished game. The fact they have been selling it for $50 successfully for years is wild.\nWould have much rather paid $100 for a fully finished product.\n\nUnless they have a massive overhaul on the \"Official Release\" October 25th, I cannot recommend this game. Shame.",
      "On the Steam Store page for [i]Candle[/i] I saw:\n\n1. The game's description: \"Candle is an adventure with challenging puzzles.\"\n2. The 5 most popular tags for the game: Indie, Adventure, Hand-Drawn, Puzzle & Fantasy\n3. The beautiful screenshots\n4. The 'very positive' reviews\n\nSo I bought it. I should have actually read some of the reviews, though. It turns out [i]Candle[/i] is just another platformer game. Granted, it's a \"puzzle-platformer\" but still a platformer where agility, dexterity and a lot of trial & error are key to finishing the game, although there is some light puzzling involved, as well. I don't like platformers. I also don't like pixel hunting for items, which is what you need to do in [i]Candle[/i] to find all the items you need to advance. You see, some items are almost absorbed in the background and frustratingly hard to spot. So there will be a lot of backtracking, unless you follow a guide, which then kills part of the fun anyway.\n\n[b]In summary, just a friendly warning: if you think [i]Candle[/i] is a beautiful point & click adventure game, like I did, don't be fooled. It's actually a beautiful, frustrating platformer game with some light puzzling.[/b]",
      "For context, I played it on PC for 77 hours including the post-game content which I presumed to be obligatory to complete. I highly recommend to use a gamepad or other controllers instead of K+M controls because support is bad in the ported version.\n\nNow, to start with: Undernaut: Labyrinth of Yomi is a first person dungeon crawler at first, then a horror game second. To my surprise, the game remarkably managed to show the correct way to set an ominous tone and a gritty narrative of a sick and twisted world with the story pulling-no-punches when it's required which I personally absolutely enjoyed. You, as the main protagonist will be subjected to numerous morally dubious acts to survive under the whims of otherworldly beings whether you want to or not. And adding that, the somber visual style captures perfectly the way the story should be told. And I simply adore the art directions and the representations of the characters in-game such as the Mad King and The Divine Child which I noticed to be quite different from the other characters' design of which heavily came from the Spirit Hunter series artist. Different from the other games, ULoY is a reverse-isekai game where the world takes place in Yomi Ward - Japan during the Showa period. It's a very interesting take on the trope and one I thoroughly enjoyed.\n\nFor the gameplay section, you have the freedom of choice to role-play as either Male or Female MC, as well as choosing a multitude of charming portraits for your subordinates with the ability to add backstories and backgrounds for the full immersion. You have 8 classes to choose from, with each diverging into Specialized and Comprehensive jobs. In my opinion, Experience Inc had done a wonderful job of not overpowering one class to another, instead adding great complimentary skills i.e buffs that lasts until returning to base, withstanding K.O etc. Not to mention, fine-tuning the equipment system such as weapons, armors, and accessories having elements of diversity to effectively and efficiently killing enemies and dungeon-crawling.\n\nBut there are two gameplay elements that I absolutely enjoyed using. The first being the \"Flowers\" mechanic to build ladders, bridges, fast-travelling and much more to progress in-game, connecting shortcuts or finding secrets. It's very interactive and simple in design but contributes extremely well for the overall dungeon puzzles in the game. Next is the \"Switch Boost\" mechanic during battles, allowing you to select 3 wonderful benefits such as \"No skill consumption\", \"Damage halved & HP recovery\", and \"First initiative + raised accuracy and evasion\" to maximize your strategy. There's also the added benefit of speeding through battles if you want to which is a plus for me.\n\nThere's also the \"Talk System\" where you could either Talk, Attack or Use Item to glean information and lore of the game as well as multiple-choices in the dialogues that implies your MC as being money-loving or having a dry sense of humor. Earning money is not a problem in this game, since you will be selling quite a lot of items and junks (which I did) that you could use to upgrade equipment, buy flowers and create items. It's a neat thing to have, that's for sure.\n\nAs for the music direction, there's quite a number of reused tracks from Experience Inc's older games such as from Stranger of Sword City and the Spirit Hunter series which while I appreciate they're being used effectively, I hate that they didn't have much variety and lacking impact in certain areas of the game. Though admittedly, I have found myself quite fond of the Mad King's theme and Kenji Yazawa's \"Namennayo!\" as well as certain bosses and dungeon themes.\n\nSpeaking of variety, the dungeon and enemies designs quality compared to other Experience Inc's DRPGs are somewhat lackluster. Lackluster is an understatement, they really do pales in comparison to Demon's Gaze and SoSC in terms of innovation and atmospheric sense. Whether they have the lack of production values which you could definitely notice since the game doesn't even offer voice-acting or simple battle cries for your party or being simply plain lazy I don't know.\n\nFor the main cast, I'd say they are amazingly done with great personalities, no cap. Hanba is your self-centered supervisor, grounded in nature but kind nonetheless. President Kaori is your money-loving mysterious female supervisor, a very cool one at that. The Divine Child is...your main driving purpose in the entire section of the game, at least from my perspective. Her presence and representations are very emotional, depressing and tragic. Which ties very well with the Mad King with his grand delusional obsession to his dream that makes her life a total suffering. The Cyborg, my personal favorite, is your reality-check being made form. I love them all though, really digging their art styles and backstories.\n\nThough some of their flavor text including the equipment and dialogues hint of their world spiritually connected to Demon's Gaze, SoSc, SoSW and so forth which is a pleasure to know. But ULoY is a standalone game with its own self-contained story, so you don't need to play older titles to understand the plot.\n\nOverall, while I'm happy I got to enjoy this game and invest in its world, I do think Experience Inc should've ported with good K+M support, charge a well-deserved price tag instead of ripping their consumer off as well as implementing prime QOL updates i.e permanent SAVE OPTIONS so I could save and backtracking my choices or place in game, fixing text that's not running their usual lines going outside the text box and adding simple battle cries to your party (like they used to do in past titles).\n\nI paid, played and enjoyed it immensely. ULoY is a game that you should not skip if you're a fan of DRPG since the story is a true gem in this genre, however niche it is. Paying a premium price (60$) for a game that's not triple AAA quality is my way of supporting the devs, but for those interested to play do not follow my example and wait for a sale or something.\n\nOnto my closing thoughts, I truly think Experience Inc. have great potential, and I wish more quality DRPG games from them while maintaining the same dark narrative they are known for. Overall a solid DRPG experience 8.9/10.",

      "Okay so,\n\nFirst off, the Streaming of the game play yesterday did this title zero favours. Whoever made the decision to allow a copy of the game which was 400 builds behind to be live streamed made a mistake.\n\nThe character creation is a nice touch, makes you think and get involved with it characteristics of the nation you pick to play as. I like this and rarely see stuff like this in game.\n\nThe Steam page states 'SuperPower 3 is tailor-made for all the megalomaniacs out there who are convinced they can do a much better job at running the world than real politicians and military leaders across the globe'. That's a rather bold statement for a game that has 5 or 6 laws you can change for a whole country...., \n\nOverall the game in its current state is incredibly basic and lacks any depth in regards to the actual management and running of a country. No parliaments behind a leader etc, why? Even the excuse of the focus is around you and your characters decisions doesn't make much sense. It takes away the feeling of running a country, that which you are describing in the games description.

However, I can't recommend this to everyone as after the first few hours it's become a bit of a chore.\n\n- The game is a \"clicker\" type with rpg/upgrade elements.

You build tower defense style, and equip new items, but beyond that you don't have any special abilities, no \"oh shit\" once per loop power, no ability to target specific enemies, nothing. Just watch everything play out and hope your little guy doesn't get pulped.\n- Crafting/Supplying is sort of hidden away and if you don't know about dismantling you'll never grind out all the items you need to build new stuff.\n- Lore/Journal entries are hidden away and require resources to unlock using a little button on the bottom of the screen that's easy to miss. I only found it 20 hours in. The writing is cringey and obviously done by someone who probably enjoys Adam Sandler films.\n- The card system is a neat idea, but jesus christ there's too much garbage shuffling. Imagine playing MtG with a deck of 100 cards and 90 of them are lands, and everytime you get a new hand you reshuffle the whole deck so all you get is more lands. Oblivion (destroys a tile) rarely, if ever, pops up. \n- Character skills are kinda bad? You might get a good one every level (which again, takes forever) but half the time it'll be useless \"leave 10% of food/resources at camp\" when you're not doing a resource grind run.\n- So much trash equipment you have to sort through and breaks game flow.\n\nAnd the biggest \"don't recommend\" from me would be the issue with how combining tiles works. If you put two tiles beside each other they sometimes change the tiles to something else. Example - put a Vampire Mansion beside a Village and you get a town full of ghouls that after 3 loops around the map turns into an upgraded town. But you still get trash equipment from the quests it gives, and putting a Vampire Mansion beside any other type of town doesn't change that town at all. So there's no reason to experiment, and it really limits the gameplay. You'd think they'd focus on that aspect gameplay wise, especially with experimentation to get the most bonuses out of all your tiles... but no. There's a small list of things that interact with each other, and that's it.\n\nI still highly recommend it since the game is cheap, the art is amazing and the artist/indie devs should get support. But I think it's a good 2-3 major updates, expansions or fan modding away from getting really, really amazing.",
      "Is Duskers a fun game? Yes. Would I recommend it? No, because of one simple reason:\n\nA lack of content with no mod support.\n\nDuskers is a little like No Man's Sky in the sense that the first few hours are filled with fun and wonder, but everything afterwards becomes a disappointment because the game turns out to be far more shallow than it initially seemed. As a player, I yearned to explore more of the randomly generated galaxy in Duskers because I wanted to see what other horrors, mods, and derelict types I would encounter in the empty universe - but in the end, it turned out that there was really very little else to see besides what you find in the first couple of hours. \n\nHere's a quick rundown of where the content was most lacking:\n\n--Enemy types: there's only 4 different enemies. FOUR. They also behave pretty much identically with the exception of the last one.  This was definitely the biggest interest-killer for me. \n\n--Derelict types end up mattering very little. Government A? Salvage C? Military B? It really doesn't change the layout in a particularly noticeable fashion, with the only differences being 1-2 extra ship defense turrets or something like that. \n\nI really, really wanted to give Duskers a thumbs up - I loved the aesthetic, I loved the atmosphere, and I loved the unique command line interface - but unfortunately, after a few hours, I came to realize that there's really just not enough actual content here, and that's heartbreaking for fans of this niche genre like myself.\n\n",
      "I have only one point of criticism:\nThis game lacks a proper ending or epilog; something like The Witcher's Blood & Wine DLC. After adventuring hundreds of hours, after growing fond of and close to my companions, I got kicked so hard out of the game - it hurt!\nIn fact I immediately started a 2nd playthrough, because I wasn't yet ready to let go. Please Larian, give us an epilog or at least one last night at the camp with all my allies, companions and friends for the Definitive Edition.\n\nedit: As of patch5 this has been implemented.

      "[strike][h1]Best Sex Language Synonym Reference Book 2016, 10/10[/h1][/strike]\n\n-Nah. Not really.\n\nEdit: Upon completing this game, here's something I'll have to claim in advance: while still recommending this great game with an 8 out of 10 and it has quite a solid story, I'll have to admit  that apart from Dorothy's hidden scenario, this game did not dig very deep into its cyberpunk/dystopian background, which is really a pity - and it's becoming the reason to expect another game (more specifically, A [b]SEQUEL[/b]!!!!! or prequel) from them :)\n\nVA-11 Hall-A - or Valhalla for convenience - while seemingly was a Waifu Bartending Simulation game, is actually somewhat [i]Papers, Please[/i] with excellent characters, vivid graphics, elaborated dialogues and not-so-mind-fucking gaming mechanics.\n\nDon't get me wrong: I love [i]Papers, Please[/i] and of course would rather NOT say that one is superior to another; they are both one of their unique kind, but with the very same root - under the daily life of dystopia denizens, truth and conspiracies weave with vague notices in advance; and just before you could think twice things are going really, really out of track.\n\nThat being said, I mean these two games are very similiar in story-telling: as long as you enjoy taking in all the random, weird stories as a bystander, just to find out that all these fragments come together and form a bigger picture, this game is definitely for you. And you get cyberpunk waifus, a Joshikousei hologram, a pretty cool onêchan as protagonist - and more!\n\nLast but not least, the developers of this game are nothing but truly [b]RESPECTABLE[/b]. We have crybabies on Kickstarter and Steam Early Access every focking day blaming everything for their faulty products, while this army of two whined [b]NOTHING[/b] about all the fuck-ups in Venezuela unless asked. Game dalayed? Only apologies, no excuses. That deserves a huge fricking medal and Developer of The Year.\n\nGrab the game if you want some real relax and good story before they grab Dorothy. And support the developers! They deserve this, Dorothy deserves this.",
      "Visually-speaking, this is possibly the highest quality otome I've ever played. Characters blink, their mouths move when they speak, and even backgrounds have some animated aspects, such as water movement, crackling fires and other neat little touches. The art is top-notch and, in my opinion, the game's strongest point.\n\nAnother aspect that makes Bustafellows a standout is the heroine. Teuta has much more presence than a lot of other protagonists in the genre because she has a face, voice and strong personality. She's her own character and not one of those 'we're going to make MC as bland as humanly possible for self-insertion purposes' heroines, which I very much appreciated.\n\nThe Steam version is a bit clunky compared to the console release, and at times it suffered from some pacing issues, but all the characters and their interactions were enjoyable. The main story was great; I really loved the group dynamic they established in the common route, and while Shu and Crow were definitely my favorites, there was nobody I really disliked as a love interest. They each had an interesting story behind them and unique dynamic with Teuta.\n\nThe final stories that attempt to wrap everything up were the only part of the game that just really didn't do it for me. I can't go into much detail without spoilers, but the best I can describe it is everything comes at you too fast, parts of it felt out of nowhere, and for me it was a downer. Not awful enough to ruin the game, and some of the ideas were good, but I feel like they were executed poorly.\n\nAll in all, Bustafellows is one of the better otome games out there. It's not perfect, but its strengths shine brighter than its flaws, and I'm dearly hoping Bustafelllows Season 2 gets localized so I can see more of its wonderful art and characters.",
      "[b]HUGE DISCLAIMER[/b]\nThe Steam version of Titanfall 2 STILL REQUIRES ORIGIN. It has NO useful Steam integration whatsoever. It launches the game through Origin, and you can only invite friends through Origin. If you've already got Titanfall 2 on Origin, you may as well skip this. \n\nTHAT SAID\nTitanfall 2 is one of the greatest (if not [i]the[/i] greatest first person shooters of our generation. The game's four years old, I'm not sure I can say anything that hasn't been said before.  The story is short and sweet, and genuinely really really good. The multiplayer is the meat of this game, and it's fantastic. Movement is fast and fun, shooting feels great (I mean, these dudes made Modern Warfare, so), piloting a giant robot is sick as hell.\n\nI don't know what to tell you. If you play FPSs and you've never tried Titanfall 2, you owe it to yourself to buy this game.",
      "A Short Hike is a relaxing, casual game about exploring an expansive, mountainous island park and eventually making your way to its summit so you can get cell phone reception.\n\nYou play as Claire, a bird who can climb, glide, and flap to great heights using a stamina system based upon how many golden and silver feathers you’ve collected. Along the path to the mountaintop you’ll encounter Animal Crossing-style characters who are friendly, punny, and usually have some minor task for you to solve, ranging from finding lost items to making deliveries.\n\nHelping residents of the island is completely optional, as is just about every activity in the game other than locating a few feathers and reaching the summit; as a result, length can range from an hour if you don’t stop to smell the roses to a few hours if you decide to make friends with everyone and see all the park has to offer.\n\nActivities include filling out a fishing journal by trading in your catches, digging in suspicious spots, solving treasure map clues, parkour racing, and opening up shortcuts by breaking blocked entrances and watering bouncy flowers. \n\nA Short Hike has a charming aesthetic and a lovely, peaceful soundtrack. I felt driven to see everything the game had to offer despite not being forced into any of it and never lost interest until I did so. It’s a beautiful little world that will make fans of Animal Crossing feel right at home.",
      "Fun Tower-Defense style indie game. Definitely one where your skill improves every time you die. And you will die, repeatedly. :P Expect to try out many monster combinations per floor before you find something that can delay the hordes of adventurers long enough to set up the floor beneath! I would probably enjoy some more horizontal progression + permanent upgrades for long term re-playability, but it seems like a solo dev/small scoped project. Definitely worth the price for the current amount of content!",
      "Based on the generic, cartoonish-sounding name and (at first glance) Hearthstone-looking graphics, I initially ignored Monster Train. But I later read some praise for it that made me think it might be worth a look. Especially since it turned out that I already owned it from a bundle or something. \n\nAnd what I discovered was a compelling mix of the best elements of Slay the Spire and My Life as a Darklord. A run generally takes less than an hour, and with so many possible combinations there's always something new to explore and try to exploit.",

The events for certain skins are also really fun. Sure there could still be some improvements like personal usernames or maybe a way to trade in skins you don't want.

      "This is more than a game for me.  It has become a hobby.  What started as a random purchase for myself last Christmas -- I had an old electric guitar I never played in the closet, so this gave me an excuse to see if I can learn -- has become an expensive obsession for me.  Warning -- but a good warning -- you'll find that you're learning guitar very quickly on this game, and it will become the start of an expensive habit!  I have downloaded hundreds of dollars worth of songs, bought a brand new guitar, I've signed up for music theory and guitar lessons at the local county college ... this has become a genuine hobby for me.  Literally, it is one of those rare games which has genuinely made an impact on my life.  Six months later, and the game has not gotten old.  I look forward to new songs, I laugh when a new chord I've never seen magically appears on the song that I've practiced the hell out and achieved a new difficulty.  The game is, most importantly, fun.  It remains fresh and only gets better as you get better.  I highly recommend.",
      "Hello Charlotte is not a game; it is a confessional.\nIf you're here you've probably already realized, but I wish to place massive emphasis that Hello Charlotte, and Hello Charlotte 3 especially, has very little gameplay, and what is present is very standard RPGMaker fare. If you are the kind to balk at visual novels, HC3 will not be your cup of tea. Watch a playthrough or something if you're interested, but don't expect any kind of engaging play.\nWith that said: Hello Charlotte 3 (and its DLC, Heaven's Gate) has been one of the most emotional, impactful pieces of art I've ever engaged with. It is horrifically honest, incorrigibly vulnerable, and, as previously stated-- more a confessional than a game. With everything I know how to say and with everything I have to say about it, I cannot find a way to truly articulate what Hello Charlotte made me feel (still makes me feel) and how it has affected me.\n\nHello Charlotte: Childhood's End is from the perspective not of the Charlotte of the previous two games, but a new, blank slate PC. While not necessary to play the previous two games, I strongly recommend it. It develops on the themes of the previous two games, and in doing so, completely recontextualizes them. C and Anri of HC2 return, as does Scarlett, though not in the forms we are accustomed to. We are finally given a full understanding on the nature of Charlotte and the False Realm, and what we are in relation to it.\netherane's art has markedly improved since the second game, with impressive sprite and background artwork, though their style is still recognizable. The music (some composed by etherane, others outsourced) is varied and distinctive. Most prominent about etherane's work, however, are the themes and writing, which have matured considerably since the release of HC2. Though often garish and on the nose, HC3 is a poignant commentary on the nature of art and fiction, the impact we have on one another, and our understanding of realness itself.\nYou will experience confusion. You will experience whiplash. The game intends to make you unsure and uncomfortable in its consumption, <i>deliberately</i> so. In the process it becomes a jarring, distinctive work of art unique to its creator and an important representation of the Millenial psyche. It's a psychological horror game and by God will it force you to experience psychological horror.",

Rowling, at a time far before Harry & friends were even born. You’ll play as a fifth year student in the titular magics academy, admitted this late because of unspecified ‘special circumstances’. The virtual rendition of Rowling’s works is nothing short of exceptional, with not only Hogwarts itself, but also its environs (like the town of Hogsmeade or the dangerous Forbidden Forest), all recreated faithfully and down to the most minute details. Of course, some things will differ from movies and books, with the game being set in the 1800s. \n\nThe main story follows the classic ‘manifest destiny’ archetype, where your custom-made character will discover hidden potential that ties them to a greater purpose. Despite some genuinely memorable characters and some interesting side- and main-quests, the overall narrative can’t help but fall a little flat and stale, especially towards the ending phases. Nonetheless, many enjoyable adventures await you. Notably, there are no romance or love/hate dichotomies in the relationships you have with side-characters, as your choices will always end up in pretty much the same results during questlines.\n\n[h3]Exploration, Collectibles & Secrets[/h3]\nThe world is vast and visually magnificent, peppered to no-end with points of interest that often hold collectibles, currency or other utilities. Initially on foot, and later on with the iconic enchanted brooms and even flying magical creatures, you’ll be able to explore at leisure and clear the enormous amount of side-activities. A good portion of these, however, will prove inaccessible until you gain the right spells or abilities, in a sort-of ‘metroidvania’ fashion that promotes meaningful backtracking. Fast travel and an item-highlighting spell prove invaluable in saving time while exploring. Collectibles are mostly cosmetic, enabling the customization of both your wizard and your own private room once you unlock it, to suit various styles. \n\nMost dungeons and locations have additional puzzles or hidden paths that often lead to collectibles or extra resources; exploration feels rewarding, with a genuine sense of mystery surrounding each new point of interest you’ll find. Despite that, most dungeons and locations play out in the same way, and become repetitive in the long haul.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2933385898\n\n[h3]Combat System & Bosses[/h3]\nMagical battles use spells as sole means of offense and defense. Usually against multiple enemies at once, sometimes supported by allied NPCs, you’ll have to time your protection spell right in order to deflect incoming attacks, or dodge-roll away in case of unblockable ones. Enemies are varied and range from magical creatures to dark wizards and goblin soldiers, to name a few. Some of them may be weak to specific charms, others have shields you can break by using specific spell categories (damage, utility, movement) or other special abilities, like immunity to certain effects. \n\nCombat feels engaging, well-paced and is more than a little gory for this universe’s standards, death will be far more common than in the movies or books. The way you can combine spell effects to your advantage and use the environment further adds to the base system, while the amount of passive upgrades with item traits and spell-related talents you can gain progressively add another layer of depth. In late-game however you’ll become overpowered between potions, passive traits, talents and endgame spells - so much that supposedly fearsome dark wizards will prove little more than a nuisance due to power creep.\n\n[h3]Quests, Minigames & Challenges[/h3]\nQuests usually involve retrieving something, talking to a specific NPC, solving a treasure hunt based on visual clues, getting the solution to logic-based puzzles and more, depending on the case. While some side-quests are unique and memorable, most will be fetch chores or dry open-world shenanigans that you’ll have to repeat over and over in the same fashion. Less, but more meaningful and unique quests would have been better than this bloat, for sure. \n\nChallenges are paramount in unlocking unique bonuses like increased inventory capacity, many cosmetics, and even unique passive upgrades to equip in gear pieces. They often require you to slay X of a specific enemy, finish X of the same activity, and such “long-term” goals. Some of them are a massive grind and will only give you the 25th pair of gloves you don’t need, or other cosmetics that aren’t worth the effort.",
      "9 studios, 3000 people working on the game and this is what we got... Best selling and most advanced COD ever made its debut as a technical disaster. People getting banned for no reason, couldn't able to play the game due to crashes and very bad, laggy servers. And after 2 months from the launch, most of the issues aren't fixed. Just like everything else in the game.\n\nBeen playing the game since launch on Battle.net and this game hasn't got any further. It's just another unfinished AAA game.\n\nSince this game contains Campaign (not included in this review), MP, DMZ and Warzone, this might be a long review. So here is the [b] TL;DR [/b]\n[b] Pros: [/b]\n[list]\n    [*]Gunplay & sounds such as airstrike, guns etc.\n    [*]Weapon tuning\n    [*]Al Mazrah\n    [*]New battle pass and backpack system\n    [*]Proximity chat\n    [*]3rd person modes\n[/list]\n\n[b] Cons: [/b]\n[list]\n    [*]New 3D Audio which is worse than previous game. Leads to inconsistent audio and makes impossible to hear footsteps\n    [*]Movement\n    [*]UI\n    [*]Lots of improvement from Warzone not included in this game such as option to remove or wear gas mask\n    [*]Lots of bugs and issues, unfinished product\n    [*]Animations takes too long if you don't have fast hands. Some gun reloads can be considered as inspecting\n    [*]TTK (Time To Kill)\n    [*]Much worse SBMM than previous game\n    [*]Too many bots in DMZ and their god tier accuracy\n    [*]Bad designed multiplayer maps\n    [*]Big maps in multiplayer but not enough players to fill the map\n    [*]Camper friendly designed maps and gameplay\n    [*]Flashbangs and stuns. If you got flashbanged/stunned, just leave the kbm/controller\n    [*]Not enough contracts in Warzone\n    [*]Not able to create our own perk package\n    [*]Disconnected from Steam\n    [*]The price\n    [*]Infinity Ward's realism obsession\n[/list]\n\n[b] Some bugs/issues the game has/had: [/b]\n[list]\n    [*]Crashing a vehicle into a mountain sometimes causes server to crash\n    [*]Respawning as mortar(a.k.a cluster) strike\n    [*]When enemy used voice chat, people's names that appear on the left side might stay there until you close the game\n    [*]Unregistered hits such as melee\n    [*]Broken anti-cheat that bans people for no reason\n    [*]Unable to move for the rest of the match when you deploy recon drone sometimes\n    [*]Disappearing HUD after using airstrikes\n    [*]Getting 10 kills in a match gets you shadowbanned\n[/list]\n\nAnd the list goes on.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h1] Long Version [/h1]\n\n[h3] Multiplayer [/h3]\n\nKinda fun to play. Game's less buggy mode is either multiplayer nor campaign. But beware, you'll find yourself playing one of the worst designed maps in COD, maybe even in gaming history. And there is the Infinity Ward fetish; big maps but not enough players to fill the map. Vanguard was bad too but in my opinion, they did one thing right which was the matchmaking up to 20v20 in a single map. This game needs the same thing because most of the maps are HUGE.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h3] DMZ [/h3]\n\nThey called DMZ in beta state but they should've called it alpha or pre-alpha. Just a mode where you get in, do some contracts or some faction missions and get out. No economy etc. Nothing exists to keep it alive. Once you finished your faction missions and the 7 weapon cases, you're basically done with this mode.\n\nBots are way too much aggressive, it's not even fun. You get almost no armor if you don't purchase it from the buy and there are bots everywhere, shooting from far away, dealing tons of damage that will knock you out immediately. Beware, if you're skilled player or SBMM decided you're, bots will have higher accuracy. All thanks to SBMM.\n\nThere is also another map you can play which is called Building 21. The idea is really good in my opinion and it changes the whole atmosphere of the game. No mini-map, armored bots (annoying af), limited equipment and mini bosses. There are times where you'll see an enemy from away but you might not think that was the enemy if their skin is black/dark.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h3] Warzone [/h3]\n\nOh boy, Bugzone my beloved. I don't know where to start. First month in a nutshell: launch the game, crash, repeat.\n\nThis game is really [b] 2.0 [/b] because they abandoned everything what made Warzone unique/good and tried something different.\n\nTTK (Time to Kill) and movement what makes Warzone 2.0 not enjoyable. Can you kill fast? Yes. Can you get killed fast? Yes. Seems fair right? But if you're a rusher like me and someone is camping in the corner (which is the 80% of the community, sadly), most of the time you have zero chance to react. You need 3 plates to stay alive otherwise you'll die almost immediately. They need to adjust ttk a bit. I think long range ttk is kinda ok but close and medium, not at all. Akimbo's and Fennec will insta-delete you in close range. RPK, Kastov 762 and TAQ-V are so powerful in medium and long range. If there was a bit movement in this game, it might help you get out some situations, even with this ttk. \n\nYou thought Warzone had bad audio? Wait until you play Warzone 2.0. They managed to create a [b][i] new 3d audio [/i][/b] which is worse than the previous Warzone. You can play this game with no sound without a problem because you're not able to hear any footsteps.\n\nIW obsessed with realism but they forgot we are here to play COD, not something like Tarkov. Animations that takes forever to end etc. If I wanted to play something realistic, I wouldn't be here playing COD. But hey, lets take a look at their [b][i] realism [/i][/b] logic.\n\n[b] IW Realism Logic [/b]\n[list]\n    [*]9mm pistol can kill you with 3 shots while you're fully armored but 50 cal. sniper requires 2 headshots\n    [*]Melee > Bullets\n    [*]Jump out in a vehicle while driving so fast and get no damage\n    [*]Heli dropped 1 meter above the ground explodes\n    [*]Truck going faster than most of the cars\n    [*]You can't armor up/reload the gun while running and not able to fire a single bullet while sliding but, you can run & jump while you're carrying 100 rounds lmg, 50 cal. sniper and 50 rounds smg at the same time\n[/list]\n\nMuch more can be added to the list above. I think IW continue to provide/develop the engine and gunplay but for the love of god, stay the hell out of anything else about gameplay because your decisions made this game less enjoyable.\n\nThis game is pain but I don't know why I'm still playing it. Still, not recommended in its current state.",
      "A simple but detailed explanation of why, after having played both versions, I prefer Definitive Edition (DE) instead of 2013 Edition:\n\n-2013 Edition's farms don't automatically re-seed, forcing you to either order your villagers to re-seed them, or to mash the \"queue re-seed\" button in the mill. In DE, you can set the mills to automatically re-seed.\n-Definitive Edition lets you shift-click construction orders just like in 2013 Edition, but in the latter, the villager will move to build the last building you placed down. If you order several buildings, they will stop constructing the building they're already working on to go build the new one. In DE they will wait to finish the first building before starting on the next one.\n-2013 Edition's unit sprites are very pixelly and hard to distinguish one type of infantry unit from another, and to a lesser extent, one team from another. DE's graphics are much clearer so it is very easy to distinguish unit type/team.\n-Definitive Edition is far, FAR more customizable than 2013 Edition. Not just with the settings (graphics, UI, and controls are much more changeable) but especially with creating a game, namely win conditions, starting conditions, map sizes, unit restrictions, etc. You can adjust many more settings to make a new game into whatever kind of scenario you want. Also you can see what the map types actually look like in DE.\n-Definitive Edition has noticeably better pathfinding than 2013 Edition.\n-In DE you can zoom in and out. In 2013 Edition you can't.\n-In DE you can queue build orders while simultaneously upgrading the building. In 2013 Edition you can't even see any build options while a building is in the middle of upgrading.\n-In DE you can tell scouts to automatically scout out the map.\n-In DE the HUD shows you how many villagers are working on each resource. 2013 Edition does not do this, you have to play hide and seek with each one to count them.\n-The soundtrack for DE has more faction-specific songs, as well as less repetitive music. Both game's soundtracks are good, but I find having the DE soundtrack playing in the background to be more enjoyable. This point is pure preference.\n-2013 Edition's graphics are nice if you enjoy the old-school style, but DE's graphics are significantly easier on the eyes and prettier.\n-Definitive Edition has more civilizations.\n-Definitive Edition is just as moddable and has a very passionate modding community.\n-Definitive Edition seems to have more balanced gameplay.",
      "This game deserves a more in depth review than it has had yet, so I'll do my best.\n\nBetween the campaign and the puzzles there is some good content that will make you think hard.\nThe Campaign's final battle was suitably epic.  Unfortunately, beating the campaign and trying all of the puzzles and only failing on 2 out of 17 puzzles, both of which I think were bugged, only took me 13.8 hours.  paying the 6 USD sale price for 13.8 hours of good fun, I think I got my money's worth, but I've had better deals. \n\n what would give this endless hours of fun would be if the multiplayer or offline vs. CPU modes were good.  Unfortunately I've tried searching for multiplayer games without being able to find any.  It seems like this game got buried in mass of games being produced nowadays and noone bought it, so unless you have a steam friend you can buy this game for and convince to play it with you or this game shocks everyone with a second wind of sales then multiplayer just isnt going to happen.  Multiplayer also lacks a menu where you could potentialy see what other players games are going on and have an option to observe those games if those players allowed observers into their games.\n\nthe Offline VS. CPU mode didn't impress me either.  This and multiplayer are the only modes where you can build your deck from the full complement of cards in the game.  The Campaign, while fun, doesnt even use a deck in 6 of the 9 missions, and when it does use a deck, your card choices are heavily limited.  Unfortunately, the CPU AI is pretty bad, so I can't realy test what cards are good or bad effectively in the VS. CPU mode.  Another feature I would have liked to see for the VS CPU mode would have been the ability to play with or give the CPU a random deck.  there is no random deck option, you have to pick your opponents deck, so you know what they have.\n\nOne thing that disappointed me from Steam's side is that in the window for \"similar to games I play\" on this game's store page, it didn't list Pox Nora.  This game is infact similar to Pox Nora and less buggy than that game.  Last I played Pox Nora was like 2 years ago though but I have over 390 hours in that game.\n\nOverall I'll give this game a 6.8/10  I wanted to give it a higher score, and I still do reccomend it.  It is good fun and takes a good amount of thinking hard for about 13.8 hours.  Understand that if you do buy it, chances are you probably wont find yourself playing it much longer than that.\n",
      "I highly recommend this game for the atmosphere alone. It's worth learning the ins and outs of the combat just to explore the wider world of this game.",
      "Intel Core 2 Quad @2.66GHz\n8GB Memory\nWin 7 64 bit.\nGeforce GTX 680 (X2) SLI\n\nMy CPU is pretty far under minimum requirements, but the game still loads up. The tutorial was releatively lag free. Once I got out in the open, however, the lag was incredibly noticeable. I'm sure I can \"play the game\", everything looks great, but it's clear to me I will be doing everything in slow motion.  Reading other reviewers who have specs above minimum, others are having lag issues as well. I'm hoping it's just a universal patch needed or a new driver update. Either way, I dont regret the purchas. I can still finish the game, it will just take a good buddy or two to hold my hand through the intense stuff...and to revive me.",
      "$15 during the autumn sale was a great price for a ton of fun and a game with some truly breathtaking visuals and effects, one of the best looking games I have ever seen. It is a worthy addition to the JC franchise. Combat is more of the same from JC2, there's tons of explosions, a big open world, great sound and music, and solid mission progression without having to grind which is becoming a thing of the past now with microtransactions in games. The game's biggest flaws are that dirt bike handling is the worst vehicle handling I have ever seen in any video game, some wingsuit missions are beyond frustrating, and it is Square so it of course isn't optimized very well unless you have a powerful setup. That and the ending is one big lazy cop out sucky easy boss fight.\n\nI was luckily able to bypass optimization issues with a powerful setup and minor tweaks. So don't risk it unless this is on sale, your pc is powerful, and also provided you don't mind a few crashes in a couple missions. Just remember that Square is #1 in continually barfing out horrible pc ports and they will never learn so even with a beast pc you are still taking a chance.\n\n7/10 because of a ton of glitches I didn't mention that would take way too long to write down, and because of Square continually sucking balls on making optimized pc games. In which they cannot do.",

      "(If you're past a certain age, I can just say that this is Take Two Interactive's \"Bureau 13\" game, except actually done WELL. If not, keep reading.)\n\nTechnobabylon was one of the best games I played in 2017 (yeah I know it came out in 2015, shh). Wadjet Eye has done it again with Unavowed, one of the best games I played in 2018 and an amazing capstone to all of their work so far. You can play this game without having played the Blackwell series, but you'll get a little more out of it if you have.\n\nIt's also a rather dark piece of work, with a tone somewhere between Sleepy Hollow (the TV show) and something like Buffy. Your character (whose gender and former profession are chosen by you) gets possessed and goes on a year-long murderfestival rampage across New York City. Eventually the Unavowed, a brave supernatural-evil-fighting duo show up, and with the body back in your own control you sign up to fight evil with them. \n\nAs the game goes on, you recruit more characters in Bioware style, solve mysteries (all of which center around that year of hell your character went through), make Tough Choices and work to make the city a better place. All in absolutely gorgeous 640x480 resolution pixel art. \n\nThere were a couple of puzzles that slowed me down (the word \"LEGS\" is going to cause me to make faces for weeks) but this mostly flowed very smoothly. If you're at all a fan of past Wadjet Eye creations, this game needs to be in your life. If you're not, it's a good starting place, maybe the best starting place except that its quality might spoil you for the rough patches of past games.\n\nThis game contains some gore, some body/existential horror that might be jarring to some, and a lot of swearing.",

      "In 2013, after 10 years of waiting, the Sim City community of modders, fans, and aficionados rushed out to purchase the fifth installment of Sim City. Ten years is a long time to wait for a game, but people had a lot of faith in Maxis when they announced the title. Long story short, it was a massive dissapointment. Maxis and EA crippled Sim City 5 with DRM, Always On APM, tiny maps, forced origin installation, lacking mod support, no steam support, and a forced multiplayer aspect.  I decided to not purchase the title, so it may have been a decent game, but 2 years later a team of 12 people created a game that does everything maxis insisted was utterly and totaly impossible.  \n\nEverything the mod community did that kept Sim City 4 on the shelves in Wallmarts across America for an entire decade was ignored. Maxis (and to a lesser extent EA) ignored the fans, and gave the people who had kept them in business for twenty years a crippled subpar game.  And for that Maxis is now out of business. They will never make another game, and it is no one's fault but theirs.\n\nNow pretend none of that happened. It's 2013 again, and here it is people: Sim City 5. \n\nThe game balance is a bit on the easy side for veterans of the genre, but the potential map size is ENOURMOUS and customizing your city could fill up years of gameplay time.  The game runs so smoothly with so much going on, it really shows how lazy Maxis was with their approach.  The glass in buildings reflects the sun and the buildings near it, there are dynamic shadows, zoning is back, and it is not 'dumbed down'.  A single tile in this game is twice the size of the alloted map in Sim City, and you can purchase dozens of additional tiles to expand.  The map editor is awesome, the community is thriving, there are mods to do anything you want, and this is the city building game we've all been waiting for.  I can not possibly reccomend this more.",
      "\"The good things, the happy things, all of it changes. Nothing can stay the same forever. Still...can you find it in your heart to still love this place?\" (paraphrase)\n\nClannad . . .\n\nOH Clannad . . .\n\nI remember watching the anime in high school, and absolutely falling in love with it. Upon realizing the REAL story was told in a visual novel...I HAD to get my hands on it. I almost died of a joy-induced heart attack when a legitimate English version of the game was released on Steam.\n\nThis game bro. This f***** game. When I was a senior in high school back in the day, this game was my refuge. I was mostly friends with older kids back then, so by the time I was a senior I didn't really have anybody to chill with cuz all my friends already graduated. Its kinda hard for me to make new friends, then and now if I'm being honest. I related to Nagisa a lot for that reason. \n\nI mostly related to Tomoya and Sunohara tho. One of my best friends growing up really reminded me of Sunohara no cap lol. Type of dude who was the comic relief/brunt of everyone's s*** talking but w/ a mutual understanding its done in jest and love. And when things ever got serious we always had each others' backs, and even tho he's a goofball and kind of a meme, he's seriously loyal and a true ride or die.\n\nMany times when Tomoya was expressing himself in this game, I had to almost pinch my face and remind myself I'm not the one thinking these thoughts: I'm playing a VN lol. That's how much I seriously related to Tomoya. In so many aspects and ways that would make my review even longer than it is now if I were to attempt to explain why I relate to Tomoya so much. Yeah, sure that could just be shrewd character design from Maeda Jun's part, but it was almost uncanny how many of the things Tomoya went thru when he was younger/issues with his father/intimacy issues he develops later on in adulthood etc. almost perfectly mirrored what I was struggling with irl. It gave me something to relate to. It expressed emotions I was having trouble even admitting were present in my own self. Maybe that's the real reason I love Clannad so much, and maybe because of that I sit here biased with rose-colored nostalgia goggles. But even if I type this review with a tinge of rose-coloring obstructing my critical eyes, I can say with confidence that Clannad is more than a game. More than an anime. \n\nClannad is an experience. An experience I wish I could forget all about...just so I could experience it anew all over again. Whether you experience Clannad thru the anime, VN, movie, whatever...Clannad is an experience in a league of its own in my book. And the best way to have your Clannad experience is by playing this masterpiece of a Visual Novel. Hands down. \n\nHonestly, I'd ideally have all Clannad virgins go straight to the VN and play it to completion but that's just not a realistic request as this game takes the average player 80+ hours to complete just the main story apart from optional achievements haha. If you're a fan of the anime...why haven't you played the VN yet!? Lol. If you've never seen the anime or movie I'd STILL recommend playing this game. Just keep in mind to use a guide (just trust me on that. please) and be willing for it to be a bit boring at first. If you stick with it, believe me...it's not gonna stay boring for long.\n\nIf you liked the anime but hated the anime ending, PLAY THE VN. No spoilers, but trust me when I say the VN ending is the true conclusion of the Clannad experience. You'll find out what I mean if you stick with the VISUAL NOVEL to the end.\n\nI didn't go to my senior prom. I spent it playing this game. And I don't regret that decision one bit to this day. I experienced this game, standing in similar shoes as Tomoya at that time irl: rebellious kid about to graduate high school with no real goals or aspirations, struggling to find it hard to \"love this place\" or truly find something passionate to live for. I didn't want to go to college. There was nothing I wanted to do there. Most of the people in my grade back then thought I was quiet and lonely freshman-sophomore, then bad news junior-senior when I started acting out. I was just, lost. \n\nExperiencing Clannad helped me find what I was truly passionate about in life. Family. Friendship (as corny as that may sound). Being able to step up for what only YOU can protect when life is calling you to maturity.\n\nClannad helped me see that even though things can get dark... even though tragedies will happen regardless of our efforts to keep them from happening... even though things can never, and will never, ever stay the same in this life...and even if you lose your way eventually... and sadly reach such a lost and depressed state in life, that you mistakenly conclude for a short while you'd rather sever all your connections and ties with the world and everybody in it... in an effort to try to prevent experiencing even more pain... \n\nThat \"loving this place,\" loving this world, loving people, and forming deep, lifelong and lasting connections with this world and its people, NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS, is ALWAYS, ALWAYS, worth it in the end. Especially when it matters the most.\n\nNow I'm not gonna front: Clannad isn't for everybody. Some people just can't get into the moe art style. Some people may find it a bit too melodramatic at times. Some people may find some of the comedy or bits of the story weird, or just not their cup of tea. Some people may find it hard to relate to all of the characters, and for some people it won't have a Cindarella's slipper level of relatability like it did for me. For those people who are kinda feelin \"ehh idk if i'll really like this game\" I'd say it'd be smart to watch the anime first. But if you're feeling good about it and wanna experience Clannad the BEST way: cop this VN. Just wait for the good bits to slowly boil. Patience is a virtue :) And save yourself hours of rage by using a guide from the beginning until the after-story credits roll. With Clannad I'd say its almost always recommended to use a guide.\n\nAnd if you love the anime and haven't played the VN... you're weirdo number 1, 2, 3, 4 and even 5. Haha I'm playin but srsly get the VN already you owe it to yourself to experience the VN. Knowing what happens in the story and getting some events \"spoiled\" doesn't detract from the VN experience. That I promise you. As someone who watched the anime before playing the VN, who's now such an obvious fanboy of the Clannad VN as demonstrated by my wall of text of a review (lol), trust me: I'd bet money you'll love this game just as much as I do.  \n\nTo Maeda Jun, and all of the brilliant writers of this quintessential, modern classic of a story: thank you. Thank you for gifting all of us the experience that is Clannad. Because of your labours, you've helped a wayward knucklehead like me finally be able to declare this in spirit and in truth:\n\n\"I love this place.\"\n\nLong live Kazamatsuri!",
      "So, I've been playing games for 36 year now. All the genres, like them all. Most of all RPG, turn based strategies, WW2 shooters (BF) etc. And just achieved victory in Slay the spire, after 206 hours of hugely enjoyable play.

      "[h1] Look at my hours real quick. That's about. 4 hours? [/h1]\n\nFallout 76 is boring. There's no other way to put it. The Core objective of Fallout 76 was to gear the Fallout 4 engine for multiplayer. They succeeded! The art is visually amazing, even down to the 2D art shown all over this store page, so what's wrong?\n\nConsider who's still playing this game. Who's desperate enough to play this game? Well, It's not a lot of people. And they aren't very good people. It's just people. Existing. I had 0 conversations during my 4 hours. \n\nLets talk playing. The game is boring. Since I just mentioned the objective, lets talk about the NPC's ETC. [b] I got this game for free, I cannot emphasize how little this game means to me. It's terrible. [/b] The NPC's & story were not part of core development therefore the game suffers. You get stuck doing some quests you don't care about and play a game you'd rather not play. The NPC's are essential as expected so, you cannot kill them either. \n\nMicrotransactions Via Atomic Shop & Premium plague the game [i] but lets talk about more! [/i] There's free events like a crate dropping & player trading outposts. Wanna know what's wrong here? The game boils down to, find a player trading outpost and buy sh*t, or just dropping crates? well the crates are full of nothing. the games gear-towards premium really gives you nothing in terms of loot so you're playing what is a hollow, unfinished, boring, game. Even in 2021! \n\nCreatures & enemies are cool however there's a big issue of the game not being cool. You may say its worth it to play just to engage the wild-life but even they feel soul-less and void of life. I don't know how you make a game so devoid of soul really. I've met mannequins with more personality than anything I met in Fallout 76. \n\nThe world isn't interesting, it's a barren void forestry area. Sometimes you get a tiny bit of quest, however aside from this game being a complete and utter lore-destroyer for those interested, what it does leave is not good enough to compensate for all of the cons. Honestly, if this was a mod for 4, I'd feel better. But even when getting this for free, I feel scammed.\n\n[b] I'll end this by repeating my hours. 4. At no point was I excited. Enthralled. Interested. I sat for 4 hours, wanting to tear my hair out and scream, because I was so bored. I had tests in school, more interesting than this. The entire 4 hours I spent playing, I wish I had played anything else, & I got this for free! I genuinely wish you the best of help if you end up buying this game. It's horrific. [/b]",
      "I am a day one player who quit the game within a few days. After coming back after almost 2 years, I am shocked and surprised. The overall improvement is great, quests are not bothering you.

      "Should you buy this game? So glad you asked. Yes!\n\nShould this be your very first JRPG? Yes, [i]but...[/i] read on.\n\n*\n\nMy recent gamplay was a 90+hr adventure (some offline) that was well worth the discounted price (-50% = 8€). The game's positive reviews are well-deserved, but tell little of actual gameplay to someone who might be interested in this kind of RPG, but never did play a JRPG/SRPG. \n\nThis was may be your case, too, so here's what I learned... \n\n***** [b] World of Zemuria[/b]: thoughtful, detailed, infinitely rich. (5/5)\n\nFor this installment in the popular franchise we get to adventure in Kingdom of Liberl, discovering a wide-reaching plot and tackling some mysteries. Cliché much?\n\nThis game does not shy away from the overused concepts, but delivers them with fresh spins, and gives them some unexpectedly serious reasoning. Talking to various NPC's, including random household members, paints the game's stage a somber shade of grey - with much emphasis on recently fought war and new orbment technologies available. (You'll be amazed at how many NPCs stress over a family member unable to get or hold a job.) As you march on, you'll learn that beneath all the apparent sweetness lies a serious, compelling narrative. Its logic includes economy, psychology and strategy and favours realism + logic to drive and resolve many conflicts. The overwhelming cuteness and apparent anime-aesthetics serve as a visual counter-point and a fun diversion for the consumer - as ever.\n\nXSEED did a wonderful job on translating and adapting the game. [url=xseedgames.tumblr.com/post/92769039590/xseed-blog-the-legend-of-heroes-trails-in-the]With the problems they faced[/url] and work ahead of them, this needs to be stressed.\n\n[i]Warning for the easily offendable:[/i] This RPG follows the tradition of amalgamating many diverse cultural and historical influences in a distinct blend of East & West. When the Gospel and an Apostle make an appearance, they singify something else from what one might expect. Also, while loved and cared for, children of Liberl do get exposed to real danger. That orphanage you helped? Burnt to the ground. The grand-daughter wanting to help her grandpa? Gets sternly warned, but ultimately joins for an incredibly dangerous infiltration mission to rescue him.\n\n***** [b]Playable characters[/b]: varied, with very flexible builds, require some system mastery. (5/5)\n\nYou get to make a party of up to 4 PCs and as the story goes on, more people join the Bright kids. The Bracer Guild they're a part of provides them with much quest fodder and some plot protection, but ultimately, they're on their own. Their companions are darn well excellent and come in very handy: if you can't fight through an area, wait until your ranks well. Of the 6 available, Schera's and Oliverier's antics made me giggle ever so often, and they are my favourites. In lieu of an old favourite of mine, imagine a game where most of in-game banter has Sands pitted against Neeshkas... You'll love it.\n\nSo what's with the builds? They are limited, but not in a bad way. The character level-ups are automated, abilities are unlocked intermittently and vary greatly (each character has a different build, but no class). You get a pick of 5 equippable items + some slots to fill wil crystals which are more than wondrous items, because they synergize. You may play around for a bit and just pick anything to wear/slot, because there's always a reload/retry or flight from a battle... I've actually made it halfway through the game before I read up on those orbal crystals and made my first optimized builds. \n\nAll in all, the character building is very beginner-friendly, which helps a lot. And there's ample room for experiment, which is great. Strategic value of turn-based combat is best described elsewhere, but let's just say it doesn't disappoint.\n\n[i]Warning for the lazy:[/i] The characters need to be fine-tuned, eventually. Final chapter presents a tournament which requires a higher level of orbal system mastery, while the final battle sequence ranges from enjoyable (if you got the combinations right) to downright enfuriating (if you didn't).\n\n[i]Warning for time-constrained:[/i] Beware the walls of text. Seriously. It's a living book.  It eats players.\n\n[i]Warning for the romantically inclined:[/i] There is much in-game talk about the nature of Joshua and Estelle's growing relationship, yet not one NPC seems to mind the fact that they're officially siblings (Estelle is Cassisus' daughter, and Joshua's his ward/stepson). Which is fine by me, because the two couldn't be more opposed than they are, and their confusion about life & love is delivered tactfully and with much wit. \n\n*** [b] The gameplay [/b]: a rocky ride to get through the story. (3/5)\n\nWhat I didn't miss here was a feeling of game being rushed and some content dropped because of time constraints - something my favourite Western RPGs chronically suffer from. The main narrative is one of adventure, with walls of text hinting at massive spoilers. I enjoyed it immensely, and can't wait for the sequel!\n\nWith that said, there are some glaring issues with gamplay and story presentation. The one thing I did have a problem with were wildly varying secret quests one can discover along the way (you'll need to consult a [url=www.gamefaqs.com/psp/933329-the-legend-of-heroes-trails-in-the-sky/faqs/62079?single=1]guide[/url] to get them). In-game Junior Bracer Journal served me well as an agenda, so that's a plus. \n\n[i]Warning in general:[/i] achievements such as best rank/weapon take a lot of time and effort, so be warned and grab a guide BEFORE starting the game properly. As TvTropes put it, my playthrough suffered a heavy case of Guide Dang It!\n\n[i]Warning for time-constrained:[/i]  I didn't mind all the grinding, but you can't escape it. Especially if you want the best gear the game's got or insist on micro-managing stuff. The difference between starting the Chapter 1 as L14 (my first try) and L18 (the second playthrough I finished) taught me to grind as I save: at every opportunity, as much as I can. And also, the railroading, apparently a traditional facet of the JRPG genre. Finally, hasty decisions versus small time windows. You can miss so much with only a click. I re-did the Prologue because I was merely getting to know the ropes and I missed two books I wanted to collect. The re-run was worth it.\n\n*\n\n[b]TL;DR[/b]: Very good game, with some issues for the uninitiated. Merits a sequel (localization's in the works!) and a second playthrough (especially for achievements).\n\n*\n\nThank you for reading this review. It was my first, and I hope it served you well. =)",
      "This now classic arcade made history as being one of the first twin-stick shooters that employed 3D arenas in an interesting manner - this was an important addition to the shmup genre, which really blew me away as a developer working in the same genre. But this also brought a problem: the gameplay was made harder by the 3D rotating camera. \n \nIt impacts overall visibility and the clarity of collision between the player and the enemies. Also, the game is often late with its warnings to the player related to the incoming appearance of enemies.\n \nThis makes the player die occasionally not because of their own error but due to visual glitches. \n \nI personally didn't like the upgrades because I found it unclear in what ways are they affecting the gameplay and they didn’t really help me achieve higher scores. \nOther noteworthy features include 12 battle modes including Paciﬁsm, King, Claustrophobia and 4 all-new modes, but also the local co-op.\n \nOverall this is an interesting addition to Geometry Wars franchise, but Geometry Wars 2 still sits on the throne. If you are a GW fan, I would recommend this game because it shines in all other aspects. \n\nIf you are looking for other interesting shooter games, I would like to invite you to check our community group on Steam:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/593680\n\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/593680/Rocking_Pilot/",
      "Someone has to be the first, I guess.\n\nI don't know, I just didn't really feel too hooked on the game's premise. I feel less like I'm solving a puzzle and more like I'm hitting a pinata for all the clues. Every replay, I'm just going to have to do something whacky in order to get a new clue as to what might further my cause. And that doesn't really make me feel like I'm a part of a story, as much as a I feel like I'm going through an eternally looping monday, getting increasingly distanced to the world around me as I finally end up throwing myself overboard, because 'why not?'.\n\nI won't refund it, because I think the devs have poured a lot of heart into this game and I do think they deserve the money, but I couldn't really find too much entertainment in the game.",
      "Remember when you first played Thumper, and you were expecting a rhythm game but got so much more?\nOr when you played Thomas Was Alone, and you somehow fell in love with characters who were literally monochromatic rectangles?\nOr when you got to the final level of Journey, and you nearly cried of amazement at the emotional EXPLOSION AND RELEASE?\nAll those feelings? That is Sayonara Wild Hearts.",
      "Way too much grinding, no crafting, bad performance, only 4 classes, not enough replay value. Overall an unfinished game. BUT it at least it has microtransactions to get those sweet skins xD",
      "Only one word to describe this game\n\nOutdated.\n\nThere is no real point to get this game unless you want a slightly better looking UI and atmosphere. L4D2 already contains the campaigns from L4D1 and is where the entire Left 4 Dead community is. Only a small playerbase still plays l4d1, mostly out of nostalgia. But there is quite literally no reason to get the game.\n\nYou can grab it if you are into achievements, but only do so when it goes on sale, i grabbed it for a couple penny, still a bad idea.",
      "First off, just want to say this isn't a Metroidvania. This is a Zelda clone. And a good one!\n\nI bought this game because I heard it really put stress on you. You have limited time to complete the game and NPCs will begin dying if you aren't fast enough. Pretty crazy, right? Well, I do have a few gripes with that, but let me point out the good stuff first:\n+ Amazing combat. You have access to both guns and swords, but most of your damage will likely come from melee weapons since they have the ability to do an extremely-easy-to-pull-off PARRY! Parrying an enemy stuns it and gives your next attack against it a massive damage multiplier. All enemies, all bosses, and most projectiles are parryable, so this is what combat ends up revolving around. Even though I call it easy, you still get that cool feeling when you walk into an ambush and clear it without taking a hit, so it never gets dull as you go through the game.\n\n+ Good dungeon design. Since this game takes after Zelda, it's not shy about inserting a few puzzles into its dungeons. The overworld as well has quite a few surprising secrets and side quests that you won't be expecting when you play for the first time.\n\n+ Sequence breaks. This is mostly for New Game+ (or New Game Extra, a separate mode where you have access to major exploration items from the start, but not your whole endgame inventory), but it was interesting to find out how many secret paths and shortcuts there were, and how tightly they were managed. The devs thought of everything!\n\nSo now for the bad stuff.\n- Underwhelming story. Guess how much is really explained over the course of this story. If you guessed \"all of it\", you would be completely wrong and here's your dunce hat. Unsighted ends up spending so much of its time on the protagonist's relationships that it fails to answer several of the more important questions concerning the game's backstory. Why was there was a war? Who started it? Where are the humans now? Why are they so disorganized? Why do they seem to have no chain of command whatsoever? How did the automatons ever win anything at all at any point when they seem so extremely outclassed? I guess it doesn't matter. Look, there's two robot-girls kissing.\n\n- Fake pressure. I heard there was going to be pressure before I started the game, so I decided to go DEFCON 1 from the get-go and rush everything. I ended up completing the game in 10 in-game days and I felt pretty good about it. Zero NPC deaths! Zero! I'm a super awesome amazing hero, right? Well, credits roll and... the only achievement I get is the one for beating the game. No one really cares and apparently you're meant to play through multiple times anyway. So... why did I ever care? Why is this mechanic even in the game? All it did was make me shy away from general exploration and side quests since all of those things are less important than, ya know, saving the world. You can call that interesting, but when it has no payoff, it ends up being frustrating.\n\n- No post-game. Did I mention, if you bumrush the game and finish with just hours left on everyone's timers, you don't get to do any extra no-timer exploring afterwards? No, the game's over. Load the save and you get set back to where you were before fighting the final boss. If you want to do any actual exploring, that's what \"Explorer\" mode is for. You know, that mode that makes you feel like you're cheating?\n\nBasically, Unsighted is another game filled with missed opportunities. I recommend this game because the core gameplay and level design is very well done and very well executed, but you should probably know this before you start:\n\nThe only pressure here is the one you imagine. Since the game does nothing to acknowledge your successes, just play it at your own pace and don't be shy about using Explorer. Shame on the devs for hailing the agony of defeat, but not the thrill of victory.",
      "It's a pretty game, but there's no option for manual saves, and autosaves only happen once in a great while instead of immediately after solving each puzzle or progressing through conversations. I also felt like the walking was extremely clunky with the mouse and keyboard, and I'd prefer click-to-walk.",
      "Ok, so... one of my favourite films of my childhood. HOWEVER; not being able to start in SANDBOX mode from the start almost INSTANTLY put me off this title, I mean, really? So you have to complete the in-game island tasks/missions (***)*)*)*)*). And after only 4 hours of play through.... \n\nSPOILER ALERT: Dinosaurs escape their enclosures!! ALL THE TIME, its frankly trying to emulate the movie (Jurassic Park 1) as where the DIno's always escape and again SPOILER ALERT: THE INTROS TO EVERY PART OF THE GAME BASICALLY TELL YOU THIS IS DEFO GOING TO HAPPEN.\n\nTo conclude:\n\n1) There is a heavy lean on the movies (I personally don't think that's bad)\n2) It offers a SANDBOX within the opening screen however then informs this is blocked (WHICH IS ANNOYING) until certain missions have been completed.\n3)  DINOSAURS ESCAPE CONSTANTLY\n4) DINOSAURS ESCAPE CONSTANTLY\n5) The game is more interested in visuals rather than content",
      "Great gameplay with baaad user experience. There are no tooltips or explanations as to what is going on at all, just kinda gotta figure it out. Otherwise the gameplay is smooth and there's a climb mode called spiral, slay the spire style, very fun. 5 different classes all able to level their decks and get new cards and abilities until lvl 30 I think, got my enchantress to 20 but still more to go. Story mode is more of a tutorial but still interesting.",
      "Impulse Control is a lazy, badly made ripoff of Angry Birds, with slightly less features and options, poorer physics, worse quality assets, and overall worse gameplay.  But to differentiate, they slapped a Facebook style personality quiz on the front, much like putting a hat on Frankensteins Monster works well as a disguise, you know.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, the game doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.\n\nThere's no options to change the resolution for the game or customise the graphics settings.  There's no way for gamers to ensure this is running at the native resolution of their displays... there's no guarantee this game will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.  There's no way for gamers to try improve the low quality graphics.\n\nThese technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.\n\nThe game is completely free.  This is noble a gesture that shows dedication to both gamers, and the gaming industry.  Nothing speaks more to a developers belief in themselves and their product than making their game available for everyone without remuneration.  It's a shame in this case that the implementation is below the minimum standards a dedicated PC game should offer to enthusiasts.  The quality here is simply too low for me to recommend, even for free.  I really feel like this should have been a mobile app, like the Angry Birds game this is a blatant ripoff of, but then it would have to compete with Angry Birds.  It certainly doesn't belong on PC.  Sometimes the only way to win is not to play.",
      "[h1]Game Pros[/h1]\n\n• Open world\n• Not a GPU/CPU intensive game. Easily runnable and runs quite smooth.\n• Beautiful cut scenes/visuals, gorgeous!\n• Clean menu.\n• Night/Day Cycle.\n• Weather does effect how you take on a mission.\n• You can easily get immersed in the game and play it for hours without even knowing it.\n• Tons of missions and side objectives. Tnere will be plenty to do.\n• Everything you do in-game affects the current and future missions.\n• Those who can stragically plan better will have an easier time progressing through missions with a higher score.\n• Various weapons/tools/items/gear to research. Lots of customization.\n• Custmomizable \"Mother Base\" with soldiers and objects/items from the open world.\n• You can infiltrate other players bases and steal soldiers/resources (FoB's/Events alike).\n• Multiple companion's that you can bond with throughout missions. (You are not alone!)\n• Intelligent and adapatable AI. They will deal with people using repetitive infiltration methods and the like.\n• If you punch one of your soldiers in the face, you will recieve words of praise.\n• Not a game you can just breeze through in just 10-20 hours.\n\n[h1]Controversial Features[/h1]\n\n• Mission checkpoints can have a large gap, punishing your stupidity and impatience.\n• Not necessarily a \"Pay to Win\" option, but there are microtransactions in this game that 'enhance' your online experience. (MB Coins)\n\n[h1]Game Cons[/h1]\n\n• Storyline seemed to be lacking/repetitive.\n• AI and player pathing have a few bugs when encountering ladders or something of the sort in small places (Seldom occurs, but worthwhile to mention).\n• Can feel repetitve at times during missions due to similar objectives (Go here and kill/rescure this person, etc).\n• Hackers have been spotted while online. (FoB Attacks)\n• You CAN NOT bind anything to a numpad key. Which blows for left handed PC gamers.\n\n[h1]Relatable Games[/h1]\n\n• Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes\n• Metal Gear (General Franchise)\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nWith the ingenuity of Kojima and Co. combined with the power of the Fox engine here is another gem to marvel upon- Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. The game/franchise as a whole continues to be a lovely experience with a multitude of things to do online post-story. Seriously, you will always have something to do. The story is mesmerizing, leaving you with a feeling of wanting more. For the hardcore Metal Gear fans out there, many of your questions regarding to 'plot holes' will definately get (at least some) answers this time around!\n\n[b]Overall Score: 90/100[/b]\n\nThank you for reading!

      "(UPDATED AS OF 1/1/23 AT BOTTOM)\n\nGame doesn't load. Running steam/EA (Origin)/Fifa23.exe as admins doesn't work. Reinstalling EA Anticheat doesn't work. Allowing everything thru firewall and antivirus (even turning them off) doesn't work. Changing bios to secure boot didn't work. Reinstalling game doesn't work. Any and all combinations of the above does not work.\n\nRequested refund from Steam. I have played maybe 4-6 hours right when it came out before the small update they pushed stopped it being able to load. I tried reverting to that initial version, doesn't work. But because Steam said I played more than 2 hours they won't refund it, even though it doesn't work. They told me to talk to EA. Requested refund from EA. They said to talk to Steam.\n\nGame won't work. EA wont fix it. They steal your money. Filing a report with the Better Business Bureau AND a deceptive practices report with the State's AG office, against BOTH Steam and EA. F them both, thieving C's.\n\n\nUPDATE:\n\nFiled a BBB report on EA. They said they cannot offer resolution such as a refund since I purchased through Steam. When I ask for a refund through Steam they state even though the game no longer works, its past their refund window and they cannot refund. \n\nSo, filing a BBB report on Steam. If that fails to refund, then I am filing a Deceptive Practices report with my State's Attorney General's Office. I'll update further, potential class action lawsuit in the works.\n\nAlso Steam has an F rating on the BBB - I wonder why??\n\n\nUPDATE 2 (1/1/2023);\nFinally got the game to play, here is how (worked for me - may not for others)\n-Uninstall Fifa 23\n-Uninstall EA App\n-Uninstall EA Anticheat in Programs Folder \n-Delete all EA Folders in Programs Folder\n-Close Steam, right click, Properties, Compatibility Tab, Run As Administrator.\n-Used CCleaner to delete all temporary files and clean registry errors\n-Settings, Gaming, Xbox Control Bar, Turn the Slider Off\n-Restart\n-Install Origin App, login, close, set to run as administrator\n-Reinstall Fifa 23 through Steam\n-Set Fifa 23 to run as administrator in the steamapps folder.\n-Set EA Anticheat to run as administrator in both locations: Programs Folder (under EA) AND Programs(x86) Folder under Steam\n-Restart\nOpen Steam, Open Origin, Run Fifa through Steam - WORKED FINALLY\n\nNOTE: I have been running in secure boot mode this whole time, so if you arent set to secure boot, you will also have to set that.\n\nI still dont recommend this game. It took me 4 months to figure out how to run this POS with zero help from EA and Steam. They also dropped the price of this sh!t game to like 25$ after I paid 85$ for early access and couldnt play it for 4 months. Think they'll refund that extra 60$? Fk no. So done with EA, never buying again.",
      "Really grimy visceral horror game, Puppet Combo always scares me even as a life long genre fan. SOOTH is very challenging, but also very rewarding. Love the retro aesthetic and uncompromising brutal demeanor of it all, massive respect to the developer. This gameplay style isn't my favorite, took me a few attempts to get through Nun Massacre, I prefer The Glass Staircase/Murderhouse ect. But SOOTH is well executed enough that I was able to get into it. I did encounter some pretty gamebreaking bugs but reloading saves/brute force I was able to get past them. A lot of jank in this game could definitely use some more polish. Jumping into the vent on the lower bunker level was insanely annoying. It's not perfect but honestly I wouldn't want it to be that's part of the charm. Just the amount of mental/emotional strain the player goes through during a Puppet Combo game is hilarious I love it lol. The puzzles are also a huge improvement over previous titles. The ending I got was extremely macabre this game doesn't mess around. Overall I'm glad I waited for the full release and plan on trying some more endings. Horror fans if you don't know these guys yet this is a good one to start with. 8.5/10",

      "There is a lot I could say in terms of ups and downs but ultimately this is a really amazing space drama. To say that I had an amazing time finishing all 3 on one save file is an understatement. I had all kinds of emotions going through this game. Some happy. Some sad. Plenty of indifference. At the end of the day it was a fulfilling experience.\n\nIf you play ME 1-3 I have a couple suggestions. If its your first time don't look up anything online on how to play because it will spoil it. Complete as much content as you possibly can first and then do a 2nd play through to complete what you wish you would have. In the 3rd version bring my boy Javik on most your missions; You wont be disappointed.\n\nBrings a tear to my eye to finish it all the way through for the 3rd time. Really makes me think about a lot. In terms of story telling its 2nd to none. I sincerely wish more games were this thoughtful but then it wouldn't make it nearly as special of a game. Thank you to everyone who had a hand in its development. You have created a modern masterpiece and a timeless classic. With that said; I should go.",

      "To whom it may concern,\n\nHere are the pros and cons for Civ 6:\n\nPros:\n1. Easy to learn and very begginer friendly, especially those new to 4X and turn based strategy games\n2. It looks for very good and the artwork (except for some leaders) is wonderful. Seriously, compared to any other 4X game Civ 6 is just stunning. \n3. Its just a very fun game\n\nCons:\n1. The AI is just absolutely horrible. Just completely sucks. At lower difficulty levels it's very stupid, and at the higher difficulty levels, its still just as stupid and makes the same mistakes. It just gets so much more starting resources to try to make it challenging, but any experienced player will tell you, that instead of being challenging and rewarding, it makes it, boring, tedious, grindy and repetitive.\n2. Some UI features that should have been standard (like having a Production Queue) aren't [art of the base game and need a UI mod to significantly improve the game.\n3. Because the Civ series has always had a strong emphasis on the single player part of the game, the different civs are NOT balanced for multiplayer, which really ruins the multiplpayer experience.\n\nOverall, I would give Civ 6 a 6.5 out of 10 and with a UI mod installed it's a 7.5 out of 10. I would reccomend it to players that are new to the 4X and turn based strategy game genres and fans of previous Civ games will enjoy it. If you are an experienced 4X or strategy gamer and looking for a challenge, you probably will not enjoy Civ 6 and I would not reccomend this for you (Seriously the Ai is garbage).\n\nI hope this review was helpful. Thanks for reading.",
      "Ever since an indie game showcase a while back, Sumire interested me. Hooked by its beautiful artstyle and interesting concept.\n\nToday I finally managed to play it. Game is not perfect, menu controls feel inconsistent and counter intuitive. The dialogue might mess up while fast traveling, and there's an area with some broken lighting.\n\nHowever, as a stroytelling medium Sumire excels. The game is short about ~3 hours long. The game has many beautiful moments and scary moments. I made some mistakes, and by the end i almost didnt want to go on, what if because of my mistakes i couldn't do what i wanted. But i pushed on, and by the end I was happy that i kept going.\n\nIn summery, Sumire is a short game that ask you to make the most of one day.

      "[i] THIS MATCH WILL BE RED HOT. HERE GOES [/i]\n\nLord knows what attempt number, and you again hear the ring bell. The level boss keeps laughing, taunting your every failure. The brainwashing music is starting to give you a headache, your eyes are moving on their own, the difficulty is boiling your blood to the very cells and the controller screams for mercy as every retry gets more and more intense. The anger flows and the addicted child in you claims it will be the last try.

But suddenly, it happens. \n\n[i]A KNOCKOUT![/i] \n“Phew, that was intense...time for the next one!”\n\nThis is the very essence of Cuphead.

This is a game that yells nostalgia and effort in every moment. It’s a wonderful experience that at every turn you can tell they didn't just put blood, tears, effort and sweat at every second of work for the last years, they put so much LOVE. Love for the past and love for an era long gone but never forgotten.\n\nThe most pure fun I had raging in the whole year.

      "I didn't like the FPS section; was honestly pretty repetitive and gratuitously violent. Also the 8 hour sex scene was a bit out of nowhere, but after like hour 3 you understand why they devote so much time to it. Overall game was ok I guess",
      "[h1] Too much for too little? [/h1]\nThe game hovers over/under an hour (depending on your pace) and there really isn't much in terms of replayability....besides going through it again or trying to obtain all the achievements (which aren't challenging), this at most would add a couple more hours.So in short you don't get much content for the price tag, with that said what you do get is quality.... a lot of it, ranging from the art to the music and everything in between. Now with that in mind, I believe that if the lack of content hinders you too much wait for a sale, but if not go ahead and pick it up you probably won't regret it. \n[h1] What's inside? [/h1]\nStory is very straightforward without much depth behind it, but that's not necessarly a bad thing... at least when it comes to this game. What makes an otherwise simple plot into something much more enticing is how everything like the art style, music, flow from one scene to the next and especially the interactions complement one another in order to create a sense of immersion w/everything that comes with that feeling. \n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\nI highly recommend this game for anyone with feeeels and without.

Devs close topics because their fanboys get flamey when you bring up any kind of criticism. Like how the servers with anti-cheat and server saving (which doesn't save player status/location) functions enabled kick all players from the server every 30-60 minutes. I wouldn't mind reconnecting if my location and hunger/thirst got saved during this \"server save\".

      "Early review right now after a quick hour of play.\n\nLater Alligator (and I swear I'm not biased towards this game at all) is a gorgeously 2d-animated, primarily point-and-click, cartoony romp through Alligator New York City. Everyone's alligators. The gameplay itself is simplistic; unlike normal point-and-click games of this style that you might have come to expect, there's no picking up items, there's no real big decision making. It crosses over more with Professor Layton-style gameplay, wandering around the city and picking up little collectibles by clicking on various pieces of the environment.\n\nScattered in between these are a plentiful trove of minigames in all sorts of styles. As far as I can tell, they begin to increase in complexity the further you go through (for reference, the first minigame is pretty much not fail-able; you're asked to track a Queen in 3 Card Monte, however the hapless alligator running the game barely moves the cards and flails on the two that *aren't* the queen.)\n\nHowever, it seems that the gameplay and the minigames are meant more as a vehicle for the whimsical comedy of the writing and the eclectic cast of characters present throughout the city. Each character is quirky and fun in their own way, with their own little story. And that's the real draw of this game. \n\nSo this game so far doesn't particularly lend itself to anyone looking to challenge themselves. But if you just want some good feelings, a laugh, and a spot of relaxation, Later Alligator delivers in spades.",

That last death was cheap, I'll do one more to make up for it. I just need 1000 gold for that upgrade, I'll just do one more to get it. Always just one more. \n\nThings I like:\n\n+Strong RPG Progression - Gold from your run can be spent on stats, equipment, abilities, etc. making multiple runs and longer runs more rewarding.\n\n+The game is witty and has flavor. -- there are various conditions your new characters can have such as being blind, gay or having a fear of chickens, amongst many, many others. Dying is in this sense, pretty fun. The writing has a lot of charm!\n\n+The controls are very tight -- this game has good controls. It's easy to do what you want, which is good because it's very tough and you will die a lot.\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n- The bosses in new game plus don't get harder -- As you progress into new game + or ++ or +++ and beyond, the bosses don't scale well, despite the general enemies leveling up to basically become bosses themselves. Not a huge deal, but it's the only negative I have.\n\nThen at some point you realize you've beaten the game, Thankfully there is a new game plus.\nMaybe just one more playthrough...",
      "EDIT:\nRobot Entertainment has decided to dump Gameforge as the EU publisher and publish the game themselves. I would like to applaud their decision. Better late (in this case quite late) than never. However, I will not change this review to recommended for the simple fact that they shouldn't have selected that publisher in the first place. This is what ultimately ruined the EU version of the game, and it should be a good example to any other developers who consider Gameforge as their publisher (although more are more developers are duming Gameforge nowadays). I am not going to edit any of the details below since I haven't played the game after I wrote the original review, but I will most certainly consider returning to the game after the migration of the servers is complete.\n\nHere's the original review:\nPart 1:\nHow To Kill A Potentially Good Game (For Dummies):\n- Make a potentially good game.\n- Give the publishing rights to Gameforge.\n- Done!\n\nI mean, let's take a look at some of the games that Gameforge ruined:\n- Aion EU (utterly dead)\n- Tera EU (completely dead)\n- Soldier Front 2 EU (a.k.a. \"S.K.I.L.L., although the only skill you need for that game is a wallet)\n- Raiderz EU (shut down)\n- Mythos (shut down)\n- Katsuro: Path of Honor (shut down)\n- Hellbreed (shut down)\n... the list goes on ...\n\nWhy would ANYONE in their right mind allow Gameforge to publish their game?! Gameforge is known as the WORST European publisher. No one does business with them anymore and they're close to filing for bankruptcy. They already closed their location in Berlin. Why would you do that, Robot Entertainment?\n\nIt could have been a great game...\n\nPart 2:\nSince some lovely folks commented that they would REALLY (real-time executive realness) want me to review the game itself, and not its publisher, here you go:\n\nPros:\n- Great voice acting. The way they went with it (overly sarcastic) could have ended up being cringy, like the one in Wildstar, but instead, they did a good job with it.\n- Good animations. The game feels like it's polished and well executed.\n- Short queues and loading screens.\n- Interesting tower defence gameplay (as far as the Survival mode goes).\n- Character development and a crafting system.\n- Runs great on a high-end laptop.\n\nCons:\n- Poorly optimized for computers that are supposed to be able to run the game on its minimal settings.\n- Gets quite repetitive quite fast.\n- Grinding for materials can be tedious.\n- The Siege mode needs a lot of work. It is nowhere near as polished as the Survival mode.\n- The Survival mode can be too short at the early levels.\n- The developer decided to give the game to the worst publisher in Europe, and probably even the world. I mean, even EA isn't that bad anymore. I guess Gameforge could compete against Webzen for the first place.\n- You are able to buy almost everything with real cash, and if you don't want to, you better prepare for a long grind.\n- Did I mention how stupid the decision to give the publishing rights to Gameforge was? I think I did, but oh well...\n- The game is basically a cash shop oriented version of OMD! 2.\n\nThere you go! You're welcome.\n\nP.S.: Needless to say, I won't be spending a dime on this game, as long as Failforge gets a cut. I encourage everyone to do the same. Robot Entertainment might get their heads out of their... (you got the point) and change the publisher before it's too late for the game.",

      "Really didn't plan on reviewing, but noticed a lot of people asking if this is worth $15 on sale. Short version - definitely yes. Now onto specifics...\n\nOffline modes are very much improved. Expansion teams for MyGM/MyLeague, with expansion draft of course, and customization options for those are really cool, for example if you're looking to create a legitimate historic team court and things, you can actually get pretty close using just in-game editor. Only bad part is that you can only create 2 custom jerseys (home and away) per team. MyCareer is a vast improvement over last year, specifically due to absence of the Spike Lee story. There's a new \"story\" so to speak, it irks some people, but it's not too bad and you still have control over the entire season. One downside is due to new player archetypes, you're effectively reduced to a role player even when you reach your maximum. Personally I can still hit triple-double average on Hall of Fame difficulty with my primary player, but the new stat caps severely limit the player potential. Ironically, you can't at all play some of the iconic player archetypes such as true all-around, 3 and D, or Dunker/Defensive Specialist.\n\nOnline modes on PC are... disgusting. First off there's a smaller player base, so you're bound to run into some queue times, or a completely dead queue very late in the night. Also, the game is susceptible to cheats, for example, only couple of months ago they blocked one particular cheat from MyTeam auction house, which was blatantly obvious and apparent and had very bad impact on economy. I won't go into details here as I don't want to be seen as advertising cheating, but I think it's very obvious they are weak on the ban hammer side, and the game itself is weak on protection. Also there is the unavoidable server lag for online modes, couple of sources close to the company explained that all servers are in Virginia, US, even the EU or Asian servers.\n\nGameplay is improved over the last year, primary addition being various types of Pick and Roll defenses, you can literally see different teams using different defenses and things like that. However I feel it's important to note that stock difficulty settings are sorely lacking in realism/simulation aspect. They are all very much arcade. However, there are lot of simulation slider settings listed at OperationSports for example, and once you tweak them, the game really shines. Of course, there are still couple of bad animations that can't be completely avoided, but custom sliders help out a lot in this regard. I should note that by default MyCareer doesn't allow custom slider settings, but there's a mod tool that can be used to accomplish this.\n\nGraphics of course you can easily see in any random gameplay video - they are obviously improved over last year(s). One part that sort of falls into this category that is dramatically worse are the replays. About 50% of the time, the replay will use the silly rim camera, and you won't be able to see the play at all.\n\nIn summary, as you can probably tell from the hours I played, I find this to be a great game, not like we really have a choice on PC when it comes to basketball. After thoroughly playing most of the game modes (except Play Now Online & All Star Team-Up), I'd easily recommend this to any basketball fan. However, keep in mind that online modes can be very frustrating, and if that's your primary reason for purchasing, it might be wise to wait and see how 2k18 turns out in that regard.",
      "From my nine year old: \"We like that every screen you can stop and color, and if you don't want to color there is a story part to it. We really like to do both; there are puzzles, different colors and different sections. I would definitely recommend this game for five and up year olds.\"",

      "This game's constant revealing of stranger and even stranger esoteric strangeness with every case, the way hitting start you are slammed in the gob by an unexpectedly gnarly tableau, a sinister mise-en-scene with a man burning to death on fire or blasted apart by a canon while wry cultists in various states of masked and undmaskedness make slight comments to say How deserving they were to be killed by us in just that way, oh yes!\n\nAhhhh! That is all about what I love The Case of the Golden Idol for.\n\nIt is 13 deduction puzzles (including the DLC) for you and perhaps a friend on the couch wherein you will become acquainted with a decades long revenge tragedy that tore several families and several kingdoms apart as many people lost there lives in heinous and sometimes magical ways. As you move along the story and investigations grow more complex, which could be a bit fatiguing, especially by the end of the DLC. Though everything here is great, don't mishear me. The art is disgusting. It's visuals and music complete the necessary deranged curious mood to undergird the transmutating tone of a murder-filled horror story into one that equally unnerving as it is subtly hilarious.\n\nThis is a game made by some Latvians from Latvia, and maybe, buster, you should just pay them some money and attention.",
      "Know your History: \n\nMany of you will already know this, but this game has ties much deeper than you think. It's no secret that Bethesda's Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim had extended it's life through an extensive modding community. For decades, literally, ENBs, shaders, textures, companions, and even story-lines added THOUSANDS of hours to an already sizable game. One story-line mod was called \"The Forgotten City\".  Over the next few years since it's release, the mod had acquired awards such as the 2016 Australian Writers' Guild Award, Zero Period Top 5 Quest Mods of 2015, and others. It was an astounding mod that threw the dragon born into a deeply profound, well written, and engaging story. It was a staple for my personal mod list for years. I've played the Skyrim version countless times, but as soon as I saw this release I immediately bought this and booted it up. \nObviously this is nothing like the mod, both visually or engine wise, but the spirit of the game is still there. It's more defined, expanded, and developed. It deserves every award and accolade it's received. When I walked into the opening scene and fell down the tunnel I couldn't help but shake my head and smile as a wave of nostalgia mixed with new expectations flooded my mind:\n\n\"My god, they've done it.\" \n\nHere's to you, Modern Storyteller, all the best and more to come!",

      "Game made for gaystation. On PC controls suck as hell , the character prefers to roll over instead of climbing , which isnt an option on PS. Decent story and time needed to finish it if you're doing all sidequests along with main story and on highest possible difficulty, Exptected SURVIVAL II should be a lot harder than it actually is.\nIts like Normal but can see your HUD only every few seconds for a few seconds.. \nAlso i found soooo many bugs.. Random events dissapearing when i arrive to location , then reappearing when i leave the location,herbs that i see only on minimap and cant pick em up, NPC's bugged out in the random events, marauders in this case , so the freakers cant hit him or kill him , they just stand idle even when i come near and shoot without silencer.. Funny thing is , i could kill freakers with headshots but not the marauder NPC, tried stealth kill and my character fell trough the map..\nSometimes quest NPC / item / thing that needs to be tracked got bugged and would be non interactible so i couldnt continue with the quest unless i saved and restarted the game..\nIt is a decent game and it is  enjoyable if you can ignore all what i listed above , but needs a bit of personal effort to optimize the controls for PC, otherwise you're rolling to your death and not climbing to your victory.\n5/10, Buy on sale, Not woth the full price.\n\nForcing weapon swaps on some mission are very crappy especially in new game+ where you can use the best sniper there is they force you to use cwappy SSR short for skizzos shit rifle",

I won't completely judge the game since I haven't played it the entire way through, but it's just not very good. Plain and simple.",
      "Before I begin, are you a fan of modern art? If no, I can safely say move on, this isn't the game for you. If yes, then you can appreciate that there is a lot of famous modern art. Some pieces you will find yourself drawn to and feel something about them, and others won't evoke any real response. This is true for most things in life, but we tend to try and find reasons why we feel a certain way about other mediums, while with art we are usually happy enough to admit the various factors like skill, materials used etc. don't really impact our overall opinion of the piece.\n\nKentucky Route Zero is an incredibly well made and obviously incredibly personal game, and the level of effort put into it is astonishing, and I didn't like it. I wish I liked it, it seems so much like something I should like, but I don't. The strangest thing is, I would call this the game's greatest triumph. \"Games as Art\" has been an ongoing debate for years, but artist's always make something for themselves, while most games are made to be enjoyed. The fact that I didn't like this but I can't actually pinpoint the reason is evidence that this might be something more than most other games in this space.\n\nI won't go on too much longer here because while I cannot recommend something I didn't enjoy, I do absolutely think anyone interested in narrative games try the first two acts. I did enjoy the first act and can recommend that with no reservations, but from the second act onwards my interest and patience just declined more and more. I have no problem with wordy games, I've played plenty of visual novels that took 50+ hours to complete, but here I feel more and more of the story was being told with blanks I was supposed to fill in, but I just wasn't engaged enough with the characters and setting to bother with that, so you can easily see how this would become more frustrating over time.\n\nI wouldn't change a thing about this game, to me that would be like asking a painter to add in a few more trees to a finished piece. This game exists as a piece of art. I didn't like it, but you might love it, and you might not be able say why either, and that's a big achievement.",

I hope no one buys the DLC honestly, I know at least I won't.\n\nIf you want a review of the game, yes, they did seem to iron out most of the issues, however since I haven't played in quite awhile due to me spending too much time apparently gearing my techromancer just to come back and am unable to handle what I could before the \"balancing\", has turned me away from this game. Reducing a classes viability or power in a PVE/CO-OP game boggles my mind.

      "Steam version Review (For veterans coming from the mobile version):\n\nHi everyone! I've been a long time fan, playing the game on mobile since 1.5 (Theory of everything)\nThe Steam version is great, because, PC versions are always better, so if you have the mobile version and you're looking to \"Upgrade\" your game, this is your ticket. I highly disagree with people who try to crack the game. Come on, what are 4 dollars just to support the person who made us this amazing game? With that said, I will list all the pros and cons, comparing to the mobile version:\nPros:\n-Obviously better graphics, the backgrounds look beautiful and the blocks are more detailed, you can also adjust graphics to your prefference, varying from quiality, windowed mode resolution, as well as some other adjustments.\n-The level editor interface is VERY comfortable, there's a shortcut key for EVERYTHING. Nothing compared to Bluestacks. Using the new layers mode, you can classify your objects of the level in groups, for example, you can use one layer for solid blocks, one for decor, one for effects, etc... Incredibly helpful, as this will prevent you from constantly fighting with the game, in order to select an object which is placed in the same location as others.\n-Gameplay is great. Multiple ways to jump, and keys to place and remove checkpoints on practice. Really looking foward to being able to make your own controls scheme on 2.1!\n-2 exclusive icons. 'Cause why not, exclusives are always good.\n-Incredibly faster online performance. On mobile, it' almost impossible to save your progress. On PC it's done quick, songs are downloaded fast, as well as levels.\n-Tired of your phone/tablet running out of battery but you want to keep playing? No longer a problem! Unless you don't pay your electricity service (Higly unlikely) or have laptop (Just play while plugged in).\n\nCons:\n\n-Obviously, this great version cannot be taken on the go, so... Back to mobile GD.\n\nAlas, I'm done. This version is amazing. Recommended 100% to every Geometry Dash mobile player and newcomer as well. Thanks for reading, hope this makes you decide to buy the game!\n10/10 -IGN",
      "First, let me state that the 3 hours shown as my time played is majorly inaccurate. I spend most of my time playing games in offline mode due to living in a VERY rural area with no internet available aside from satellite or mobile hotspot (both of which have extremely stingy monthly data caps). I started playing this game less than 24 hours ago and am currently on day 22 in game.\n\nAs has been said by others, if you are a fan of Animal Crossing, Harvest Moon, Stardew Valley, Staxel, etc, this game is something you will want to seriously consider. There is already a significant amount of content available with more being planned in the developer's roadmap. What is here is well designed and feels like second nature if you've ever played any of the aforementioned games.\n\n\nWhat Dinkum Does Right\n\nGraphics - Excellent. Graphics are exactly what I would expect for this style of game, Characters, buildings, animals, and environments look absolutely great.\n\nMusic - While the music is definitely understated, it fits the setting and gameplay perfectly.\n\nSound Effects - Another area the game absolutely nails. The sound effects are spot on from the rainfall, pick on stone, bees buzzing, fish splashing, and even the gibberish language voice effects are exactly what I expected.\n\nDay/Night Cycle - The day/night cycle is dialed in to the point that it strikes a near perfect balance of giving me enough time in the day to make progress on my projects while also not giving me so much time that I can make so much progress that the day/night cycle is meaningless.\n\nTool Durability - While tool durability is still something that annoys me in video games, it is something I have grown to accept and Dinkum manages to make the system feel like less of a hindrance than most other games in the genre.\n\n\nThe Missteps\n\nThe Sky - As I said earlier, the game's overall graphics are great. The one place I've noticed that falls a bit flat is the sky. While during the night, it looks pretty decent, during the day and evening, is a bit lackluster. Not a dealbreaker, but it is a bit disappointing considering how great the rest of the game looks.\n\nUpgrading Tools - The fact that I have to buy a basic axe, pickaxe, etc and then use a couple of ingots to upgrade it rather than being able to just make a new, higher tier tool from scratch is a bit annoying. ESPECIALLY on Sundays.\n\nBland NPCs - Now this is something that I was initially hesitant to include given the game is an Early Access release and is one of the easiest things to polish up in a final release. That said, the game is being presented in a FOR SALE manner, so I feel that what is currently in the game should be considered indicative of what to expect in a full release and decided to include it. That said, the game's NPCs (with the exception of Fletch) do feel incredibly bland and lacking in personality when compared to those of Stardew Valley, Animal Crossing, Harvest Moon, and the like. As stated, though, this is a simple fix as the game nears a final release.\n\n\nOverall\n\nGiven how minor my few complaints with the game are, this is a game that I would absolutely recommend to anyone who is a fan of the genre and I consider it an absolute steal at a $20 price point.\n\nAs someone who has grown disenfranchised with Nintendo, having a game that takes the Animal Crossing community building gameplay and merges it with the farming, hunting, and survival gameplay of Stardew Valley is something I had been hoping to see for quite a while and Dinkum does a fantastic job of capturing that. This is a game I am very excited to see completed and I would love to see more games like this on PC.",

You just go right, occasionally going up or down to go right again. There's no nuance or thought required to go right, because most enemies can be ignored, and there are no real obstacles. \n\nIf you've got that itch, just replay a Mega Man game (Classic/X/Zero). You'll go through proper, hand-crafted levels.",
      "Oh, that The Resident Evil (The RE)… One of the best stories in the gaming industry! The Capcom is well done that decided to remake games. Many players criticize The RE3, but I understand them, the game is quite short, there are no horror elements in the game. But the game has become easier, for example, a knife does not wear out. The players did not forget to criticize the Nemesis too, saying that there is no element of surprise and persecution, and there’s no sense of the constant presence of someone, who can mutilate you. The Nemesis means in English as “a good script”. However, the game creators tried to convey the atmosphere of The RE and the horror that the doomed city is filled with. Well-chosen actors, excellent voice acting, correctly conveyed the atmosphere of the city. I would add more moving elements on the destroyed streets of the city, like people or zombies\nTotal score: 8.5/10",

      "With approximately 55,000 reviews -- 96% of them positive -- at the time of my posting this, it is hard to know what more I can add to [i]It Take Two[/i]'s well-deserved acclaim.  As others have said, it is an excellent cooperative multiplayer game with very satisfying controls, varied levels, and superb production values in art and audio.\n\nAside from these things, what stood out to me was the game's decency.  It is *anti*-exploitative, quite deliberately excluding features like collectibles (let alone microtransactions) or character advancement that are predicated on Skinner box treatment of the player.  Rather than finding ways to [i]take[/i] more from the player (money, time, etc.), the developers have found ways to [i]give[/i] more to the player, with many small delights to be found.

      "This game was sunk by poor customer service as well. I at one point lost years worth of items due to a bug. I was told by one of the devs in an email to \"stop button mashing\".

At one point we had a good game to play. I believe even the most played game on steam. Then something happened. It became all about crates. F this game. I'm done!",
      "Just go play it. It's only $20, and you have a 2hr refund limit. You'll love it way before then.\n\n...still here? Quick review. Awesome platformer, hits all the marks in flying colors. Let's compare w Mario Maker, the most similar game to this one:\n\n[edit: Updated to compare to SMM2 instead of 1]\nWhat Mario Maker 2 Does Better\n- Mario\n- Different themes/gameplay physics across multiple mario games\n- Much larger playerbase\n\nWhat Levelhead Does Better\n- Oh my god the search functionality\n    - Search by creator, difficulty, tags, what's popular, etc.\n    - TL;DR you can find the awesome, and avoid the crap\n- Level discovery\n    - Can actively advertise my levels\n    - Get rewarded for playing people's levels\n- $20\n- Dying doesn't take 12 years to respawn\n- Fun, short campaign to slowly unlock more creative tools after seeing how they are used\n- Local Co-op (or online with Parsec)\n- Leaderboards (if you care, I personally don't)\n\nI cannot stress enough how AMAZING it is to not have to suffer through crap levels. The search functionality is soooo good; as a casual player, it is the sole reason I stopped playing Mario Maker 1. Mario Maker 2 is better, but it still falls terribly short. I think the best part is that Levelhead gives people control over the visibility of their levels, as well as incentives to play other peoples, and that is something that SMM2 unfortunately lacks.",
      "I've been waiting since the likes of Planescape Torment and Baldurs Gate 2 for a game to match their sheer perfection, many games came quite close, but Divinity Original Sin just manages to hit so many nails on the head its not funny. It looks great and still plays fine on my aging PC, it has a great storyline, it's two protagonists have some great interactions and dialogue. The voice acting is spot on and it has the most sublime OST.\n\nThe combat is turn-based but do not let this put you off, there are so many choices in combat with the interaction of spells with each other and the environment, that the game just begs you to experiment with different tactics.\n\nThis game just oozes pure class, it was a labour of love for Larian and it shows in every tiny detail of the game.\nIf you like RPG games (or even just pure quality games), you need to play this game, it is the benchmark I will use in comparing other games in future.\n\nWell done Larian.",
      "I hated this game.\n\nHowever, it is undeniably brilliant. To try and explain how it is brilliant would cheapen the experience. I would put this game in the same category as The Stanley Parable, The Beginner's Guide, Dear Esther, and everything Freebird Games ever created. These are games that should be experienced by everyone.\n\nI was gifted this by my wonderful husband. I'm sure he meant well because he knows I like horror games. I'm going to choose to believe that anyway. What followed was five hours of paranoia, frustration, and more of a feeling that the game was playing me.\n\nThanks honey.",
      "The story of this game is interesting and well written, but it doesn't fully make up for the game's flaws. Here are the problems I saw with the game.\n\n1. There are a wide variety of guns available, but very few combinations of those guns are viable. The shotguns are rarely viable for combat with gun wielding enemies, since advancing far enough forward to make shotgun damage effective inevitably puts you in the line of fire of enough of your enemies to prove lethal. Other weapons like sniper rifles and pistols have critically low DPS and a low maximum ammo cap, making them almost universally not viable. Additionally this game likes to spring ambushes on the player in a way that takes away any advantage gained from long range optics. The special pneumatic weapons in the game also suffer from a low ammo cap. This leaves you with assault rifles, which the game seems to have been made for.\n\n2. In encounters with bestial enemies it is frequently impossible to avoid taking damage. The enemies sprint at you in packs which even sustained automatic shotgun fire cannot fully stop. Some of the boss enemies are even worse in this department. In normal mode with the larger health pool and regeneration over time this wouldn't be such a problem. But in ranger mode this makes certain obstacles unbeatable. You might have a boss which takes your entire ammo pool from both guns to kill, and which gets a guaranteed hit on you once every thirty seconds. If you go into that boss fight hurt and with no healing items, then you'll be met with mathematically guaranteed failure. The simple fix for this is to give the player a dodge function to avoid taking an instance of damage.\n\n3. This story has a few decisions to make, but mostly it is on rails. This isn't always a problem in a game, but it is when your character gets repeatedly taken unawares by things you as the player have already figured out. You as the player may sense that Artyom is being tricked, is about to be ambushed, or is going to let the bad guy get away through poor decision making. You just have to frustratedly walk into the cut scene and let it happen anyways. Its fine for this to happen at least once. But by the fourth or fifth instance it becomes infuriating to play as the character who just gets tricked and captured all the time.",

      "Earlier this week I did the impossible - I came out to a family member. One of my two sisters, in specific.\n\nI was nervous but relieved to know she accepted and supported me - and thought, you know, perhaps we should call and talk about some things. We had that call this Wednesday and I expressed a lot of my resentment towards my family - being stuck at home with some of my family, more specifically my [spoiler]mom[/spoiler], has completely wrecked my mental health. I'm still closeted from them and I live with each passing day, worried [spoiler]she'd[/spoiler] reject me - for being non-binary, for dating a trans person, for disappointing [spoiler]her[/spoiler].\n\nMy sister told me that [spoiler] my mom [/spoiler] only hears what [spoiler]she[/spoiler] wants to hear, that [spoiler]she[/spoiler] only thinks about what [spoiler]she[/spoiler] wants to see in [spoiler]her[/spoiler] kids despite often saying otherwise. From her experience, [spoiler]mom[/spoiler] seemed to be a very not open and is often a close-minded individual. \nComing into If Found..., I had only broke down early Thursday morning as my many months of frustrations and anxieties finally given the voice it needed.\n\nIf you've played the game it'd make sense if I told you that Kasio's experience with her parents in If Found... hurt reading for me - it genuinely hurt. Seeing her mom's first letter and annotating it with \"She's trying. But she has all these ideas of how I should be.\" and \"She didn't even consider she might need to apologize too.\" was something I sat at for a long time, probably longer than any other part of her journal that I was erasing through at a normal pace.\n\nMoments like that made me realize that this game is something I never knew I needed - a realization that hey, think about the move out you're doing in a month as rebuilding - as leaving the past behind. That there isn't anything wrong with that, and that you can really be yourself once we're out there, together. That family doesn't have to be bound by blood and it's really about the people who's there for you, even at your absolute worst. That I don't need to seek acceptance through others - but rather be more accepting of myself.\n\n[spoiler]\"I find I care less and less what other people think of me, and more for my own opinion. And these days I'm so much more comfortable in my own skin.\"[/spoiler]\n\nThere's people I can think of who need to read and see this.\n\nIf Found... left me with hope - and it's leaving me with a lot to think about. Thank you so much for this game, DREAMFEEL. I wish I could articulate this game better like other people have - but it's been a lot lately and I need to rest - if you're coming across this review/text you should without a doubt play it, especially if you've felt similarly trapped like both me and Kasio did.\n\nP.S. - If you find the eraser mechanic to be a little strenuous you can increase the size of the eraser in the options!",
      "It's a puzzle game about placing toppings onto donuts and delivering them to different areas on the boar. Great vibe and the first few hours are fun, but it gets incredibly repetitive even with the frequent introduction of new mechanics, especially so if you don't click with said mechanics particularly well. If it's on sale, give it a go - you very well might like it much more than I did.",
      "I vividly remember the moment when I gave up on Fallout 3: I was the ruins of some city, with a grey sky looming over the shredded grey concrete shells of buildings, and vast chunks of broken grey highway was wrapped up against, around, over and under huge chunks of grey concrete. My companion had gotten stuck somewhere in the grey sea of rubble for the umpteenth time, and it just suddenly struck me: This game isn't fun. It's just depressing.\n\nA few years later, I recalled this experience to a friend of mine, and he assured me: \"Fallout 4 isn't grey. It's got colors. And it's good.\" Having banked 1410 hours in game, I would have to say he was right.\n\nIs Fallout 4 good RPG? Nope. The story is rubbish, the characters extremely shallow, and the skill tree is very meh. If you hate VATS, like I do, the skill tree is complete rubbish. Is it good because it is bug free and has good DLC's? Nope. Is it good because it's the best shooter ever? Nope. Fallout 4 is good game because it's fun, and it's fun because it's a decent shooter, with an OK open world, good atmosphere and a sense a humor. Slap some of the 1000's of existing mods on that, and there's a decent chance that the next time you emerge from the elevator of Vault 111, switching to the catchy tunes of Diamond City Radio as you ready your gun and take in the not-grey landscape, you'll be smiling, just like I do.\n\nUpdate: Due to the recent Skyrim \"update\", breaking mods and introducing paid mods, and a similar downgrade being reported as coming for Fallout 4, I can no longer recommend this game, or any other Bethesda product.",

      "Undoubtedly one of the best if not THE BEST modern video game remaster out there. I will summarize the pros and cons of this remaster into the following:\n\n[b]The Good:[/b]\n\n- Totally seamless transition into the new modern 4K visual from the old classic Win95 at a push of a key\n- Extremely faithful to the original titles (some might say that it is perhaps TOO faithful)\n- Game \"installation\" screen when you first boot up for both Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert is filled with God tier nostalgia \n- New UI with a complete revamp of the sidebar complete with higher quality artwork that totally feels in place\n- Plethora of never-before-seen bonus contents including exclusive missions and cinematic cutscenes for Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert that was only available on certain console platforms\n- You can queue multiple units while in production now\n- New multiplayer features and service is great. Finally you can now play 1v1 ranked and spectate any previous matches that was played including spectating ongoing games in the lobby\n- You can add, remove and create your very own custom music tracks in-game for both Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert however you want\n- All of Frank Klepacki's overly iconic classical and remixed tracks are here including various modern remixed that was composed solely for this remastered collection!!!\n\n[b]The Bad:[/b]\n\n- Minor bugs (though not a real dealbreaker)\n- The gameplay meta among factions/units remains as unbalanced as ever. Kinda of a tradeoff for being too faithful to the original titles\n- Multiplayer is still officially limited to a maximum of 4 players total per map in Tiberium Dawn, while in Red Alert the limit is a maximum of 8 players total\n- FMV cutscenes are all still heavily compressed in SD resolution extracted from the Playstation home console version and further artificially enhanced via AI upscaling due to the fact that the original master footage tapes for both Tiberium Dawn and Red Alert are still yet to be found\n\n[b]The Kinda Ugly:[/b]\n\n- Certain mission on hard difficulty are completely unbalanced. This is already another insult to injury as the AI blatantly cheats when it comes to resource procurement and unit build time. The fault of a clear lack of playtesting",
      "Played the original back in 2017/2018, and I must say what a hell of a remaster, everything is enhanced, the visual the UI the user experience, its amazing to see this game in a fullscreen i can finally see the tiny details!",
      "Started strong, ended annoyingly.\n\nMoral of the story? People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.\n\nIt paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that \"routine\" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.\n\nI liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters. But it all fell apart and tries to teach a very vapid moral that someone in their early 20's who has never had a meaningful relationship would idealize.\n\nAt least it was short.\n",
      "Coming from Monster Hunter World, I didn't like it for the following reasons:\n\n- WAY more anime than World. I could overlook the weird anime stuff from World because it was more subtle, but in Rise it is so in your face at all times. Matter of taste, but for me it made the game insufferable\n\n- tiny maps. I know that this is a return to old-school maps, made for portable. But coming from World it seems like a massive downgrade\n\n- graphics and ambience downgraded. Again, I know that this is because it's designed for Switch, but it doesn't change the fact that it feels like a huge step backwards\n\n- grapple zip thing. It's flashy and fast, but I felt that it takes a lot away from the methodical feel of the game. Makes the game feel more arcade\n\nMost of my complaints are based on taste, but for anyone without much MH experience before World, it's going to feel like a step back.",
      "Excellent game, but has an awful-abrupt ending that comes out of nowhere and doesnt make sense and leaves way too many plot elements unexplained.\n\nIn the last game they introduce a secret society of energy sucking vampires that are hunting Rosa and Joey yet they are never mentioned again and instead the end of series villian is some random messed up ghost that randomly has end of the world magic powers.\n\nAwful."

      "Portal is a first person puzzle platformer where you are testing science with portals guided by GLaDOS.\n\nThe game is a classic for a reason. It uses portals as the main puzzle mechanic and combines other mechanics with the portals such as falling and gaining momentum to launch at a higher speed through the other portal. The levels gradually build up with complexity, but are never too frustrating and half of them are done with access to only a single portal. The puzzles have great visual clarity with the mostly white colors and decent visual cues on how it should all work out.\n\nPortal has the classic Valve way of telling stories, as things are already happening before you get there. You are woken up to follow instructions for the testing purposes of GLaDOS, but you are also figuring out if maybe there isn't a role better suited that could fit you. It's an enjoyable mystery leading you on without forcing it's way in.\n\nGoing back from Portal 2 to Portal made me aware of the improvements to the overall gameplay. Exiting through portals in Portal makes the camera rotate in a weird way sometimes and the levels are generally designed to be slower pace than what Portal 2 offers.\n\nIf there is one thing I didn't enjoy, it's the advanced and challenge levels. Figuring the harder puzzles is one part of the challenge, but executing them relied on tight timings where the puzzle mechanics they rely on felt too clunky to be fun.\n\nFor achievement hunters:\nTwo playthroughs are required with 2 sets of collectibles, one of which requires to be done in one go, a few challenges through the story and completing the advanced and challenge levels that can be console cheesed.

There have been many of these, and my personal favourite is the original Mutant Storm which is sadly no longer available to buy.

So for being the best implementation of the Robotron idea to date it gets a big thumbs up!\n\nSuggestions where it could be improved:\n[list]\n    [*]Graphics are so pretty they do sometimes make it hard to see what's going on.

      "I hate to do this, because the devs clearly put a lot of love into it, but I just can't give it the thumbs up.\n\nThe controls are mostly on point (slide jumping is a little weird), but the generated levels are what kills it for me. I've come to realize that getting through the hand-crafted levels is a good portion of what makes Mega Man so fun. This procedural generation simply isn't up to snuff. You just go right, occasionally going up or down to go right again. There's no nuance or thought required to go right, because most enemies can be ignored, and there are no real obstacles. \n\nIf you've got that itch, just replay a Mega Man game (Classic/X/Zero).

      "This is a game that I have been looking forward to for at least 2 and a half years. I have wanted to have a game on the PC that had the elements of harvest moon (for the little bit I played of it), Animal crossing (<3) and Rune factory. I was super excited when I was approached by Leth (publishing manager at Chucklefish) at the beginning of December to help him and ConcernedApe (developer of the game) with bug testing and QA. 400+ hours later (off steam and on steam), I still love the game. \n\n[b]Farming.[/b] The farming is fantastic. It is to me one of the main elements of the game, and it's just a joy. Being able to design your farm any way you want it... yes please. Planning out what to buy every season, where to plant them, on top of the thrill of when you can harvest and reap on the gold... it's so enjoyable and addictive. \n\n[b]Fishing.[/b] The fishing is outstanding. From playing WoW and Runescape.. or any game with fishing, the fishing in Stardew Valley is so much fun. At first, the fishing is challenging, but as you progress your skill, you become a pro in no time.\n\n[b]Mining and combat.[/b] Mining and combat is incredible. Going deeper into the mines can be tough, but if you're prepared with your food and weapon in hand, you can fend off the creatures and get your sweet ore/minerals/gems that you want to bring back to your house and possibly hoard. (Hi, I'm Bexy, and i'm a hoarder.) \n\n[b]Social.[/b] Social interactions are great. Being able to become friends with the people in the town,  and eventually being able to get into relationships with people and having a family with them.. what's not to like about that? And what's great is that it gives great replayability because you can have different saves with different spouses! The backstory for each of the characters too is so in depth and well thought out, you will be silly if you don't shed a tear maybe once or twice. \n\n[b]Main story.[/b] The actual main story is well rewarding, and once you \"complete\" it, you can still continue on your adventures and farming life with no problems, hell you might even discover new things afterwards, I sure as hell did! \n\nYes, I was a tester for the game. Yes, I have played for ridiculous amounts of hours. It may feel like i'm being a bit overzealous with this. However you have to remember, I was a tester. I tested the crap out of every aspect with this game, even though there were massive game breaking bugs, errors, glitches, crashes. I still love this game. I reported many a bug, and ConcernedApe was quick to fix them. \n\nAnd that's the thing, not only is the game amazing, the developer is too. ConcernedApe works around the clock to make sure that bugs are fixed in quick time in order for us to have an amazing experience with this game. And that's true. The experience that you have with this game IS amazing. \n\nMinutes playing turn into hours. Hours turn into \"oh no it's time to sleep\".\nYou will forget about time. You will forget about sleep. You will forget that dinner was about 5 hours ago but you couldn't' remember because you were too busy trying to fight off 12 bats that were clobbering you inside the mines while trying to gather that 1 diamond waaaaay in the back. \n\nSo yes, I without a shadow of a doubt 150% recommend this game to anyone that wants to \"escape\" for days on end with what I am classifying as my #1 Game of 2016.",
      "This is more of a personal opinion than a useful review, but I would like to share my experience with this game! At the beginning I was very disappointed... I was hoping for a Phoenix Wright competitor, but it wasn't even close! The investigation was so silly, the game doesn't let you leave the scene before you find all the clues, you can't \"weist\" your time going to places not related to the case and the trial doesn't start until you have all you need... the only way to fail is not having coordination to shoot the bullets xD The game takes you exactly where it wants.\nThe first trial was also so obvious I almost gave up playing. BUT THEN... things started to get strange. During my second trial I was \"that is what happened... I mean... I guess...\" and during the third trial I had no fucking idea what was going on D: The story got so deeper and full of details. Each chapter revealing new secrets, showing how complex the plot was!\nI realized that I shouldn't see Danganronpa as a poorly investigation game that wasn't that challenging, but as an amazing novel with such a rich story! The gameplay became secondarly compared to how envolved I was with the whole scenario! The further you go, more incredibly enjoyable it gets. So, for those who didn't like the game for this very reason, give a second chance with another point of view :) enjoy it's fabulous mysteries and you will not regret unreaviling it's secrets!",

Still pretty solid dlc if you are a fan and want a little bit of extra stuff :)",

      "Update circa Feb 2017: PLEASE READ!\n\nIt's been brought to my attention that there is a code for unlocking all the characters and stages in the game.  One of the main reasons I could not recommend this game at all on release was that, as far as I knew, it was not possible to unlock all single-player content without multiplayer modes (versus), which requires an extra controller.  As this is NOT the case, I can recommend this game if it is on sale (50% off or more, and it has been 75% off previously) and you look up the code.  If it matters, you will still need to fufill normal unlock conditions for achievements.\n\nThe game still sorely needs an online mode, has no AI for versus, and is not quite a pick-up and play title.  The two times I've returned to this game after a long absence, it has taken me a while to relearn the controls, an issue I don't frequently have with other games.  This may not be a problem if you play often enough, or with a controller.\n\nMy outdated review can be seen below\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you can gather 1 to 3 people for local multiplayer, then feel free to buy this game.\n\nHowever, if you plan to play this game by yourself, make sure you have a spare controller before purchasing this game.\n\nWhy?  Because even with a keyboard, a controller is required to play Versus mode, and certain content (at least 3 map sets and all 4 extra characters) can not be unlocked unless you can access Versus mode.\n\nIf you do not have a controller, you will not be able to unlock all single player content.\nIf you do not have a controller, you will not be able to unlock all the content in a game you paid for.\n\nI would change my stance on this game in the future if either:\n1)  The ability for a single player to fight against the AI in \"versus mode\"  is added\nor \n2) An online mulitplater mode is added  \nThe second option may be a little unreasonable, but the first isn't.\n\nEither of these would allow players to play versus mode without a controller, thus giving them the ability to unlock game content that is currently unaccessible with just a keyboard.",

      "Whoa. Wow. I was really impressed with this game. And really immersed too, where did those 20 hours even go...\n\nAt its core, TRI is a first-person puzzle platformer with relatively small levels jam-packed with secrets to find, on top of the main collectibles. The difficulty curve is pretty smooth, but steep; the game expects you to think outside of the box and be very aware of what you can and can't do. There's a ton of clever level design and puzzle design, and a lot of variety too. \n\nThere are a few minor flaws; chapter 13 is kind of ehh bad. Dying to acid or lasers makes you reload a save, which seems a bit much. Granted you'll end up saving a ton once you get to levels where you can die just so that doesn't happen, and usually it's only a minor inconvenience, but I don't see why it had to be that way. Oh well. There's also a few too many \"hidden behind fake tile\" secrets, but they still aren't that prevalent and most of them have some indication. \n\nOther than that? A lot to love. I really can't explain why it's great without spoiling puzzle solutions or the quirks of the mechanics, but it's well worth your time to play. Definitely would recommend, but it's not for everyone, that's for sure.",
      "[b][i]AMID EVIL[/i] is very much [i]Quake[/i] 1 level design in a [i]Hexen[/i]/[i]Heretic[/i] universe.[/b] It's well done. We're a bit spoiled this year with outstanding '90s FPS shooters. Personally, I prefer both [i]Ion Maiden[/i] and [i]DUSK[/i] over this title for the following reasons:\n\n1) I find [i]AMID EVIL[/i] to be a bit generic in terms of theme; the fantasy setting could use a bit more to set it apart.\n\n2) I prefer real or low fantasy weapons/guns over wands and totally high fantasy weapons. Now, don't get it twisted - I appreciate that these high fantasy weapons exist, but yeah, they leave something to be desired. I miss reloading and all of that. \n\n3) The level design in [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is much more 'sprawling' (for lack of a better term) just like the original [i]Quake[/i]. Most levels are indoors in what feels like an underground compound (at the time of writing this review). I personally like the backwoods feel of [i]DUSK[/i], or the dystopian cityscape of [i]Ion Maiden[/i] far more. I want to look up at the sky in most levels.\n\n4) The enemy design is different than the other two games I mention, which is good - but they all mostly have a 'same' kind of feel. The enemies are all super fast, so most of your efforts are focused on running backwards while fending them off. It's fun, but gunplay isn't quite as fun as the other two games for this particular reason.\n\n5) The font and overall menu system definitely feels 'Early Access'. I know the font is being worked on, which is desperately needed. \n\n6) My favorite way to play the game is Endless mode - and I feel like that's a flaw in itself. It's the opposite for me with [i]DUSK[/i]. I want to fall in love with the campaign, but eh, there isn't really any story or anything all that interesting to suck me in. The secrets are super easy to find compared to the other two games, too.\n\n7) No multiplayer. Now, I really don't care about this - but who designs a game in this genre without building this in from the ground up? You know the community is going to whine about this.

      "SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT.\n\nAs the store page states, NOREN is supposedly a 'simple' keyfinding game. That would be true if there were any keys actually in the game, but as it stands it seems that NOREN is a simple abandoned shovelware game that's impossible to progress in, let alone beat. You play as some soldier in a massive, dark castle, equipped only with a dying lantern. The light fades quickly, and you can regain light slowly by... standing by a light source. That'd be simple enough if you weren't endlessly pursued by dinosaurs that are programmed with AI which knows your exact location at all times; three chomps and you're 'aparted' from the world, where you respawn with whatever amount of light and sanity you have left. Additionally, the translation attempt is abysmal at best. \n\nBoth NOREN and its developer, ThroneLab, should be banned from Steam. I do not blow the 'scam' whistle lightly, and I only do such when I am 100% certain of something actually being a scam. There are a handful of videos of this title on YouTube as well, with only one being over 5 minutes long. No one found a key. If evidence can be presented to me that there is in fact a way to progress in this game, I will rewrite this review. Until then, beware and stay vigilant.\n\n[h1]Rating: [b]0.0/5.0[/b] - WARNING.

      "IRL, I really am an unmotivated 20 year old college student, not many friends, living away from my mom.\nThis is a game that kids might not be able to relate as much as peeps my age.. but Im not saying there's an age restriction or something, no. There's a lot of useful lessons anyone can pick up from this.\n\nThe emotional issues it tackles are pretty grounded and somewhat refreshing to see in a game. There's a HUGE mystery element when it comes to the story. (which is sooo damn good mind you). But the conversations you have with the people in this game are just so real and cherishable, you could just wish these in-game days won't stop. \n\nThe small moments you have with family and friends in Night in the Woods are probably one of the most amazing experiences I ever had in a game\n\nPS: After finishing the story, I got all sappy and tear jerky that I went and called my mom to tell her that I love and miss her and stuff.. that's what this game is.\n\nUgh kill me.

      "I love this game. In fact, I've loved it since I was in highschool about 8 years ago. My friend and I used to play this game together all the time on my flashdrive. We were always discussing & trying to understand the ins-&-outs of the game and how to get a specific ending depending on what you did. Playing this brought me back to those good times in that library.\n\nThe OSTs are nostalgic, the gameplay is about the same and the artwork is amazing as ever(actually the graphics are much better with this remake).\nThe only complaint I have is that it lags at random times(though usually in the menu).

      "Remember when Doom 2016 released the multiplayer beta test first, and we rightfully worried the game would be a flop? Thankfully, the campaign instead blew us away.\n\nI enjoyed my first run through 2016, but only moderately so. In the original Dooms, if you never stop moving, enemies truly can never hit you. With 2016, however, enemies lead their shots if you move predictably. Also, if you leave line of sight, the demons will fire several more predict shots, in case you re-engage from the same vantage point.\n\nI failed to adapt initially. Instead, I blamed the game, claiming it felt unfair compared to the originals.\n\nThen, I stumbled upon Clockner's playthrough of Doom. He showed me a skill ceiling I never dreamed possible. Next came ByteMe's speedrun performance at QuakeCon 2019. I noticed when the demons charged their shots, he would at times hold still and bait for them to aim before dodging at the last second.\n\nThe excuses were off. Doom has transformed after 25 years. The enemies are now more intelligent (yet not overly so). I too needed to evolve.\n\nAs I took on my Ultra Nightmare run (over 3-4 months), I developed a deep knowledge of every level, and in the process, became fond of every inch, as if the entire UAC and Hell were my homes. UN felt like such an accomplishment. After that, I tried to take on an all runes/weapons/challenges mastered run (no grinding). I failed the first two times. With Eternal around a day or two away, I just completed this challenge on my third try. Personally, I leave satisfied with nothing left.\n\nI initially had gripes with 2016, only to learn the developers were one step ahead. When a team/game proves me wrong, I am loyal forever.\n\nDoom 2016 will now be uninstalled from my machine, never again to be reinstalled. May your thirst for blood never quench. And may we never need you again.\n\nTo me, Doom 2016 is also Eternal 🙏.",

      "Know your History: \n\nMany of you will already know this, but this game has ties much deeper than you think. It's no secret that Bethesda's Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim had extended it's life through an extensive modding community. For decades, literally, ENBs, shaders, textures, companions, and even story-lines added THOUSANDS of hours to an already sizable game. One story-line mod was called \"The Forgotten City\".  Over the next few years since it's release, the mod had acquired awards such as the 2016 Australian Writers' Guild Award, Zero Period Top 5 Quest Mods of 2015, and others. It was an astounding mod that threw the dragon born into a deeply profound, well written, and engaging story. It was a staple for my personal mod list for years. I've played the Skyrim version countless times, but as soon as I saw this release I immediately bought this and booted it up. \nObviously this is nothing like the mod, both visually or engine wise, but the spirit of the game is still there. It's more defined, expanded, and developed. It deserves every award and accolade it's received. When I walked into the opening scene and fell down the tunnel I couldn't help but shake my head and smile as a wave of nostalgia mixed with new expectations flooded my mind:\n\n\"My god, they've done it.\" \n\nHere's to you, Modern Storyteller, all the best and more to come!",

After all, it has to be ready for take-off in order for children everywhere to receive their presents on schedule. But a wicked troll blasts us out of the sky just as the test drive is about to end. He went over the line and wants to ruin Christmas for everyone on Earth. It is up to us to bring the troll to his senses and save Christmas for everyone.\n\nTLoS brings players to one world and six levels of great platforming that are reminiscent of Super Mario World (SNES) but simplified. There are only six levels total, one of which is a castle, before the final battle with the troll. The only difference is that we will be collecting chocolate cookies rather than the traditional yellow coins. We also lose part of our cloak when we are injured, so it's not uncommon for you to find yourself jumping through the levels wearing nothing but red boxer shorts. For instance, red blocks can give you a new coat, which means extra life, or Santa socks and hats, which give a power-up or simply chocolate cookies. The power-up allows you to throw stones as if you had collected the Fire Flower from Super Mario, and that's about it. TLoS also offers a 2-4 co-op player mode, in which players will be able to work together to complete this short and family-friendly adventure.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3009359595\n\nSimilar to Super Mario World, you walk to a level to choose them in the Overworld. Once we reach a certain level, we are allowed to walk, leap, and even sprint. Additionally, there are other indications on the screen that show you how many cookies you have already gathered and how much time is remaining to finish the level. We get an extra life when 100 cookies are collected. We can activate a checkpoint about halfway through the level to pick up exactly where the checkpoint was reached, instead of having to do the entire level all over again. The game also features side-scrolling and underwater levels. The only problem is that if you quit at level three, close the game and start again, you have to start from level one, so you have to play the game in one go. This means that there are no save points or \"save states\". Considering the length of the game, this is not a big deal, but it's still \"annoying\".\n\n[h3] My Specs [/h3]\n\n[code]CPU: i9 9900k\nGPU: RTX 2080 Ti\nRAM: DDR4 32 GB RAM\nOS: Win10\nResolution: 1440p @144hz\n[/code]\n\n[h3] Conclusion [/h3]\n\nWe are all hoping that Nintendo will release their IPs on Steam so that we can play with them one more time. We may all agree, based on experience, that this is probably never going to happen, but Indie developers are there to make it happen. To avoid the tedious teachings at school, you used to be able to play these types of games in class on the usual Flash Player websites, and now you can play them on Steam. Though it's not a masterpiece, it's extremely minimalistic, and it's unquestionably too short, the 20 minutes I spent playing it were nevertheless a lot of fun, especially because the platforming is accurate and not wonky at all. Just remember, it's very minimalistic and may be too minimalistic for some, but if that doesn't bother you, feel free to go ahead and try it out.\n\nIt would be my personal highlight if there were additional levels, more secret exits, more power-up alternatives, and more hours of overall playtime.\n\n[h2] Final Verdict: 8/10 A typical gas station snack that turns out to be a surprisingly good one.🎅 [/h2]",

      "Do you kinda like 4X games, but mostly the first 2-3 hours of the game where you're exploring and hacking a basic civilization out of the wilderness and desperately fending off natural threats while trying to keep people fed and productive? If so, this game is for you. Nice tight gameplay loop where things never get stagnant for too long; always novel threats and opportunities, and you're not tied to any one settlement for very long, so victory and defeat alike are more temporary. Not to mention a really astounding amount of fun, polished content for an early access game! Eremite, Hooded Horse, I salute you.",
      "I reviewed the original Mark of the Ninja more than 4 years ago. I liked its stealth-based gameplay approach and praised the learning curve experienced throughout the story. I bought the [i]Special Edition[/i] which practically meant an add-on with some more levels, a custom and the option to replay the entire game in commentary mode. \n\nYou know some games get re-released due to the availability of a new console generation. This [i]Remastered[/i] edition is what was made available for PS4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch users not long ago. We, PC gamers (who already own the original Mark of the Ninja), can get this version free-of-charge in our library.\n\nThere's not much to say, really. I do not have a 4K display so this higher resolution I cannot enjoy. Compressed in-game art or not the original already looked very good. But the creators confirmed this will give us an enhanced experience even under 1080p resolution. \n\nWell, I did complete the game once again as this is how much I love MoN. I recommend that you do the same.\n\nPS: It may be possible that you are required to have the special edition of the original version to get the remastered version.",
      "I waited 12+ years for a proper sequel to A Crack in Time (yes i know the other games came out but tbh they didn't do much for me) for it only to come out for the PS5. Unfortunately, I wasn't getting a new console for just one game. \n\nNow, two years later I'm playing it on the PC.  While surreal, I am super glad they ported this series to a different platform, and the game was totally worth the wait.\n\nThe port by Nixxes ran very nice for me. I had a few hitches in the dimensional portal scenes, and one crash in a total of 12hrs of playtime. I do understand that some people are having issues and that does suck & does not disqualify their experiences, however, It is not even close to how bad TLOU Pt.1's port was.  \n\nIt's another Insomniac banger, and if you've played any of their games you already know whats up. I beat the game in 12 hrs on the 2nd to last difficulty grabbing whatever side content/collectibles I could before the story captivated me. As is tradition, there is a NG+ mode (haven't touched yet) and I look forward to trying it. I'll probably update the review at that point, but the games are always repayable due to their collect-a-thon nature, that and being so damn fun you have a dumb ear-to-ear smile for all of the playtime.  \n \nIf you enjoyed the Ratchet and Clank games in the past, its way more of that + the dimensional gimmick which is really well done and very neat tech wise. I love the new movement features and Rivet is a very good addition to the cast. I hope she stays relevant in the story in the future. Game feels super good to play as well, weapons are great as always. The writing is still funny and enjoyable. It's just a good time, and I highly recommend it, even at full price.\n\nLastly, I would like to direct a message to Sony/PS Studios/Insomniac Games:\nPLEASE PORT THE OTHER AND OLDER R&C GAMES PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE IPELASE PLs I WILL PAY $70",
      "Very calm game with heartwarming moments. Better played with friends. Really brilliant gameplay idea.

      "From my nine year old: \"We like that every screen you can stop and color, and if you don't want to color there is a story part to it. We really like to do both; there are puzzles, different colors and different sections. I would definitely recommend this game for five and up year olds.\"",
      "While still a work very much in progress, Nuclear Throne is currently one of my favorite games. It's a roguelike dungeon crawler with heavy \"bullet-hell\" elements and a little RPG sprinkled on top. When you begin a session of Nuclear Throne, you choose from one of several well-designed & freakish \"mutants\", each with their own special attributes which, in itself, does much to add variety (there's also a random-select option which is a fun idea in this particular case). The goal of each stage is to exterminate all of the enemies. After doing so, a portal opens which takes your mutant freak to the next level. There are a great many weapons with which to inflict meyhem on your adversaries. As you gain experience points, in the form of green goo earned by killing enemies & also found in cache jars, you'll be able to choose new persistent perks for your character (such as more HP or certain weapons doing more damage). Every so-often, you'll encounter a boss. The bosses tend to pop in during the height of an already-in-progress battle which makes beating them all-the-more difficult & hectic.\n\nOriginally, this game did not have controller support which was a great disappointment (though I had been ejoying it anyway, using the keyboard and mouse). However, a recent update rectified this and the gameplay using a dual-analog controller (such as that of the Xbox 360) is just fantastic. Like Ultratron before it (another very similar game which is also worth a look; I also wrote a review for it, if you're interested in checking it out), Nuclear Throne throws you straight back to the arcades of yore and plops you in front of a Smash TV cabinet.\n\nAs a roguelike dungeon-crawler, the replay value is extremely high (due to the fact that the level and enemy layout is totally different from one session to the next). The rather extreme difficulty doesn't hurt either, as playing entails dying and thus restarting... a lot. Fortunately, said difficulty isn't of the variety that compels you to smash your controller/keyboard in frustration. Every death feels like the fault lay squarely on *your* shoulders (if only you had moved to dodge a little faster or conserved ammo a little better!), as opposed to the game feeling like it's cheating. Another stand-out feature which I think I need to bring up is the soundtrack. ...Just wow! Nuclear Throne's score is totally original and extremely surreal. It goes *miles* in lending its own atmosphere to the game. \n\nSome might consider the current price of $12.99 to be just a *little* steep for a game in this class, but considering how well it's made overall and the fun I've gotten from it (especially being in its currently pre-release/beta state), I consider it to be well worth the price. As of the time of this writing, the developer(s) is very active and updates are coming quite frequently.\n\nUPDATE 01/12/16: I hadn't played this game in quite a while (at least 6+ months) and I wanted to check out the progress that the devs have made, etc. Well... The game starts but as soon as I select a character, it totally locks up. I can't play it at all. To make matters worse, I've heard that the devs have since \"abandoned\" development of this game (so it's not likely that whatever is causing the crashes for me is going to be fixed any time soon - or ever). Bummer man. I loved this game...",
      "I am a day one player who quit the game within a few days. After coming back after almost 2 years, I am shocked and surprised. The overall improvement is great, quests are not bothering you. Story and atmosphere is hooking you up and the overall experience is good. Leveling up is easy and also you are not struggling as in most MMOs.\n\nDespite the past of the game, I think it is worth trying.",

      "[h1]The Good[/h1]\n- Cop System.\n- Best progression in a need for speed game in years.\n- Genuinely fun and engaging, builds on the foundation of nfs2015 while taking the good mechanics from payback to make a compelling game. If the need for speed hype was still around people would stop asking for most wanted again because want it or not this is it, even if it falls short on a few cases.\n- Feel of \"speed\".\n- Insanely beautiful, runs super well, amazing lighting. Looks good on both day and night.\n- Day and night have different purposes in the game, and the fact you can choose is pretty cool as well. You can sweat if you want or if you want just races you can stay in the day.\n- Visual customization with community decals, let's go!\n- Online entirely optional, is kind of the same as nfs2015 instead of payback having the singleplayer map but instead allowing free roam drivers which is pretty cool\n- Car profiles like we have in forza, no more taking a racing car into the offroad!

Yes it's the difficulty players wanted but also too much rubberbanding, \"rhino incoming\" taking half your screen not actually letting you see the rhino, game basically requiring you to abuse ramps because there's no proper way to actually deal with cops, etc.\n- Story is short and shitty. Payback as mid as it was did the \"corrupt cop\" storyline better\n- Progression system is taken back by the included powerful starter cars which came from the deluxe edition. It's fine since it's included but I hate how good features are destroyed with certain executive decisions\n- No post-release support, as it's the case with EA games\n- Need origin to play\n- Lots of bugs\n\n[h1]Neutral[/h1]\n- Overall teenager aesthetic. I like the neon style, but the overall teenager stuff and spanish characters (which are here because of the la casa de papel trend) just don't click with me.

Need for speed is back!",
      "I'm gonna be talking about the game in very broad strokes so don't worry about spoilers. \n\nI'm bananas about the Dead Space series. The experience of playing the original in 2009 or so left a massive impression on me and I think this is overall a pretty fantastic update. I've played the original [strike] trilogy [/strike] duology to death on every system, listened to stuff, looked at stuff, everything. So as someone who has Nicole's monologue burnt into the back of my eyelids, I was pretty sceptical Motive would be able to win me over with Dead Space 23. I was very pleasantly surprised, though. It's clear a lot of love and care went into refining Dead Space for the remake and in many ways I find these refinements make the setting, characters, and mysteries all a lot more compelling. \n\nOn the lead up to release there was an IGN series of short interviews with developers, artists, writers, etc working on the remake. It was really fascinating hearing about how they were approaching different aspects of the project, there's a lot of interesting insights about the aesthetic and thematic goals of the game in there that get me really craving a Dead Space 23 art book. If you're sceptical about Dead Space 23, I think they're worth a watch. It's really striking how thoughtful they've been in creating their take on Dead Space and I don't think their efforts deserve to go so easily overlooked. If you're really interested in the artistry of the series I'd also highly recommend The Art of Dead Space, it's a great book and an amazing collection of art that really lays bare the core identity of the series. It's been a great companion piece to Dead Space 23.  I think a lot of people have been comparing the choices and artistic aims of the original team and the new devs in bad faith, I really can't see anything but reverence for the source material here. I'd also say that the differences that are there are interesting and well worth exploring!\n\nI'm also glad Dead Space has room to breathe again, EA really pushed the extended universe the first time around and I'm glad to see that mistake hasn't been repeated. I'm not someone who's super into lore, I like finding extra information that re-contextualises things in cool ways but this extended universe stuff can get pretty silly. There were animated movies, books, tie-in games, a Wii rail shooter (which I enjoyed) and most of it just served to undermine the setting and the horror for me. That isn't to say the remake shies away from its roots because it absolutely doesn't, there's an entire New Game+ path that I think incorporates a direct reference to one of the extended universe novels. If you're a lorehead you'll definitely recognise familiar names in text logs, even very forgettable characters get some mentions in. I really love this about the remake, it reincorporates a lot of this disparate stuff into more of a coherent whole. \n\nI think my favourite addition is the AI director that manages encounters and atmospheric effects. Dead Space is a game that invokes hypervigilance, I think that's part of what makes the series so compelling. You're always alert, always listening and watching, always looking over your shoulder. It has an intensity that I feel is absolutely unmatched. With the AI director in the mix that feeling is sharper than ever. You can't rely on memory alone to get you through now. Yeah, you can still memorise spawns and there are still an abundance of scripted encounters but you can never safely bet you know what's coming and when. Sometimes the lights will flicker and steam will hiss from the pipes- nothing. But sometimes a pregnant and most of a divider will be waiting for you right by the shop. You can truly never assume you're safe, that feeling is no longer illusory as it was in Dead Space 2008. I think that's great. I also found that the director would spawn interesting combinations of enemy types which is cool, it went a long way to making the threat more unpredictable. \n\nI never really experienced any of the performance issues everyone else is talking about so I think my main issue with the game is very petty. I flat out do not like the redesign of the Soldier rig. They look like those guys who're really into Mandalorian themed tactical gear and Punisher stuff. So, yeah, not sure if that's an intentional update to reflect reality but, aesthetically speaking, I found it very jarring. \n\nI think this is a very solid foundation to build on to bring back the Dead Space series. I hope in the future there might be more challenge modes, higher difficulties, more unlockable suits. Most of all though I hope Motive, like their predecessors, take some pointers from the Resident Evil games. I'm a big fan of the records system in the recent Resident Evil titles. It contributes enormously to replayability and it's neat getting to examine all the models, animations, concept art, all the good stuff. As someone who likes crafts and fan projects, something like that would be indispensable. it's all work that very much deserves to be admired, too. Some of the detail on the necromorphs is ludicrous. A records system would also be a great excuse to do wild runs like beating the game without healing or opening the shop. Just give me a reason, Motive.\n\nThere are thousands of things about this remake that I could just keep gushing about. Maybe I'll update this review over time and do just that (I have). But I hope for now this review has gone some way to convincing you to try out Dead Space. \n\nTanya Clarke killed it as Nicole, too.",
      "A simple but detailed explanation of why, after having played both versions, I prefer Definitive Edition (DE) instead of 2013 Edition:\n\n-2013 Edition's farms don't automatically re-seed, forcing you to either order your villagers to re-seed them, or to mash the \"queue re-seed\" button in the mill. In DE, you can set the mills to automatically re-seed.\n-Definitive Edition lets you shift-click construction orders just like in 2013 Edition, but in the latter, the villager will move to build the last building you placed down. If you order several buildings, they will stop constructing the building they're already working on to go build the new one. In DE they will wait to finish the first building before starting on the next one.\n-2013 Edition's unit sprites are very pixelly and hard to distinguish one type of infantry unit from another, and to a lesser extent, one team from another. DE's graphics are much clearer so it is very easy to distinguish unit type/team.\n-Definitive Edition is far, FAR more customizable than 2013 Edition. Not just with the settings (graphics, UI, and controls are much more changeable) but especially with creating a game, namely win conditions, starting conditions, map sizes, unit restrictions, etc. You can adjust many more settings to make a new game into whatever kind of scenario you want. Also you can see what the map types actually look like in DE.\n-Definitive Edition has noticeably better pathfinding than 2013 Edition.\n-In DE you can zoom in and out. In 2013 Edition you can't.\n-In DE you can queue build orders while simultaneously upgrading the building. In 2013 Edition you can't even see any build options while a building is in the middle of upgrading.\n-In DE you can tell scouts to automatically scout out the map.\n-In DE the HUD shows you how many villagers are working on each resource. 2013 Edition does not do this, you have to play hide and seek with each one to count them.\n-The soundtrack for DE has more faction-specific songs, as well as less repetitive music. Both game's soundtracks are good, but I find having the DE soundtrack playing in the background to be more enjoyable. This point is pure preference.\n-2013 Edition's graphics are nice if you enjoy the old-school style, but DE's graphics are significantly easier on the eyes and prettier.\n-Definitive Edition has more civilizations.\n-Definitive Edition is just as moddable and has a very passionate modding community.\n-Definitive Edition seems to have more balanced gameplay.",
      "[I received this product for free from a giveaway]. Only played for a short time, but sheesh, it's a bit of a mess both visually and gameplay wise. There's not much I can really say that would differ from what's shown in the trailer (rather crude MS-paint looking drawings with a few short looping backgrounds). You jump when moving right or left, flappy-bird esque, you dodge stuff going across the screen and from the top, which is a bit boring to me, but some may enjoy it more. You also have to go out of the screen to dodge sometimes, but also if you go too far out (who knows how far) you'll die as well. It might be an okay time waster for free (like old flash games), but I wouldn't recommend spending your money on this.",
      "I have always wanted to play Resdient Evil 4, and I wanted to play this game so badly.  I am giving a negative review simply because the games FPS on the PC are bad, that could be because of Windows 10 because I heared rumors that the game does not run well on it and such, so that could be the problem.   Another problem I faced is the lip sync is dealyed when it's on the cutscenes so that makes everything slow and such.  The gameplay from what I seen however is pretty great and I think Resdient Evil 4 is a great game, but this port is not, get it for the GC, Will, PS2, or any of the consloes that has this game.",
      "I appreciate the sincerity of Jusant. You can tell its creators have placed genuine care into their product, which has made the experience of playing it joyful and kind.\nThe visuals are stunning, the mechanics are not overwhelming, the soundtrack is soothing, and the puzzles are not frustrating. A great climbing game all around with an easy-to-follow yet gripping narrative. \nHopefully, Ukrainian localization will also be added soon.\n",
      "SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT.\n\nAs the store page states, NOREN is supposedly a 'simple' keyfinding game. That would be true if there were any keys actually in the game, but as it stands it seems that NOREN is a simple abandoned shovelware game that's impossible to progress in, let alone beat. You play as some soldier in a massive, dark castle, equipped only with a dying lantern. The light fades quickly, and you can regain light slowly by... standing by a light source. That'd be simple enough if you weren't endlessly pursued by dinosaurs that are programmed with AI which knows your exact location at all times; three chomps and you're 'aparted' from the world, where you respawn with whatever amount of light and sanity you have left. Additionally, the translation attempt is abysmal at best. \n\nBoth NOREN and its developer, ThroneLab, should be banned from Steam. I do not blow the 'scam' whistle lightly, and I only do such when I am 100% certain of something actually being a scam. There are a handful of videos of this title on YouTube as well, with only one being over 5 minutes long. No one found a key. If evidence can be presented to me that there is in fact a way to progress in this game, I will rewrite this review. Until then, beware and stay vigilant.\n\n[h1]Rating: [b]0.0/5.0[/b] - WARNING.

      "I would give this a mixed rating if I could. \nThe story is told in such a boring way that it's hard to stay invested. You run to one person, listen to a cutscene, or more likely read a cutscene, than go to another person to talk to. Sometimes you fight one guy but mostly it's pretty dull. There is very little gameplay in the overland content and everything plays like a bad visual novel.\n\nAAR, the first MSQ is just one fetch quest after the other with little story in it. Oh there is some story there, but it's not great. The characters are shallow with few expectations, both the supporting cast and villains. \n\nHeavensward, the expansion I got through before my time ran out, is better than ARR but not that enjoyable. There were parts I like (not to give spoilers, it was the part where you go on a “journey”) Sadly, that part of the expansion was far too short. Than the story precedes to shove itself up it’s own ass as it becomes fixated on one part of the lore. [spoiler]I don’t give a damn how the war started! It was a thousand years ago.[/spoiler]\nPro:\n-If you like story, and only story, you will like this game.\n-A lot of content\n-Trial fights. (Good boss fights without the boring part of dungeons)\n\nCons:\n-Little in the way of gameplay outside of dungeons and trials \n-ARR is a slog and not worth reading. Skip as fast as you can and just watch a recap video.\n-dungeons are locked behind the story and not unlocked as you level up.\n-The story is on the lower end of other final fantasy games.\n-Lalafells are in the game. People who play this race are degenerates.",
      "And that's it, after 278 hours of play, the adventure is over... \nThis type of game that you wish you could forget so you could rediscover it like the 1st time, where you discover everything, a bit like a child\nIt's a game made with passion for video games, to tell a story, to make the player laugh too, and to make him a little melancholic or horrified or even sickened sometimes\n\n[u]Divinity OS 2 will have marked my young adult life[/u], like Sonic and megadrive games, Pokémon, FFTactics, Zelda and gameboy / gamecube games, Warcraft3 (TT), or Mass Effect and other PC games did in my childhood and adolescence (I surely forget so much excellent games)\n\nIt's a 20/20 for me. The work is titanic. The game is really made with passion. The studio is very talented.\n\nSo when Steam asks me [i]\"Do you recommend this game\"[/i], I say:\nYes! Because this is where you feel that video games are an experience, an adventure to live! \nI went through Rivellion with my buddy, like I went through Kanto (Pokémon), or Ivalice in FF Tactics as a kid!\n\n\n[u][b]Atmosphere:[/b][/u]\nMany of us probably remember our adventures in Pokémon or other games in our childhood. We roamed, discovered and lived in these worlds!\n\nHere, it's the same thing, and not alone this time: I was with a very good friend! \nWe met frequently to venture into the world of Divinity as a lightning lizard warrior or a skeletal assassin with a mysterious past...\n\nWith our companions Lohse and Ifan, and Maladie, and Gareth, and Jahan and Han the survivor kid and Sir Lora and so many others. Impossible to forget... \n[i]They exist! Stop lying, I know they exist ![/i]\n\nOur choices were important: We decided to do justice to this or that person, provoking reactions (or death) in certain characters, slapping a few Magisters around when necessary\nAnd of course, we STRONGLY decided to stea... Borrow a lot of spells and equipments from the merchants, while the other one was distracting by chatting...\n... What? We didn't have the money and we had to save the world ! Well, we had the money, but you never know, maybe one day we will need it... !\nAnd then stealing, it's fun. And exhilarating hehehe\n\n\n[u][b]Gameplay:[/b][/u]\nA 3D tactical turn-based game, to play with friends. Really ! Don't play this game alone, I'm sure that with at least 1 buddy (or 3!), you will exploit the game to its full potential!\n\nAlso, [u]you can change your skills and class at any moment in the game[/u], it's very flexible ! I played rogue all my game, and in the last chapiter, I decided to play with spear and War skills ! I really enjoyed being able to switch like this, as I want ! The game want you to take FUN, not \"suffering\" your \"bad\" class choices !\n\nToo bad, I don't know anyone who is ready to take on the role of a GM (Game Master), to live a personalized campaign! Because it is a mode apart from the main campaign!\n\n\n[u][b]Music:[/b][/u]\nExtremely good and fits perfectly with the atmosphere of the game. This kind of OST that we listen to when we work and that makes us live our adventures again when the song becomes EPIC!\n\n\n[u][b]In summary:[/b][/u]\nTitanic content, assured re-playability for those who wish to know what would have happened if they had answered something else than \"FIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT\", and I repeat, the fact of being able to play with friends makes the game so much more pleasant to do!\n\n\n[b]*Sob*[/b]\nBut no, I'm not crying... I'm just allergic to emotions!\n\nI would like so much to forget this game to be able to rediscover it\n\nPlease play it, at least give it a try, and let yourself be immersed in Div's world!\n\nIn our case, we will do it again in HARDCORE mode !\n\nPeace guys !",
      "Volition ups the silly, and adds super powers, but loses a little something along the way.\n\nI loved Saint's Row: the Third, and by all rights should have loved IV as well, but I mostly just liked it. The set up was fun, and seemed to up the ante again, but then you get the presidency ripped away from you almost immediately (without even seeing the consequences of your first pushed legislation!). Placing the game in a virtual city for the most part with the only real characters being on your space ship, really kinda seemed to gut the game. Even when [spoiler]the world gets destroyed[/spoiler], a detached, \"meh\" was all I could muster. The humor is there, but it's mostly better in the DLC. The radio stations feel kind of underwhelming without DJs.\n\nFinally all the fun of collecting and customizing various interesting cars, and finding ways to climb or fall to interesting places with a stolen plane/parachute are gutted with the inclusion of super powers. Also, the super powers make gunplay, leveling any of your other stuff, and pretty much every mechanic carried over from Saints Row: the Third obsolete.\n\nIf you get this game, do yourself a favor and make sure you get all the DLC where most of the real fun is. Is it as good as the previous Saints Row? I don't think so, but I still recommend getting it and playing through it. It is a lot of fun, and I love the 50's break out scenario at the beginning.\n\nStacey's thoughts:\nStill awaiting DLC with Jane Austin and the D*ldo Bat.

Dying is in this sense, pretty fun. The writing has a lot of charm!\n\n+The controls are very tight -- this game has good controls. It's easy to do what you want, which is good because it's very tough and you will die a lot.\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n- The bosses in new game plus don't get harder -- As you progress into new game + or ++ or +++ and beyond, the bosses don't scale well, despite the general enemies leveling up to basically become bosses themselves. Not a huge deal, but it's the only negative I have.\n\nThen at some point you realize you've beaten the game, Thankfully there is a new game plus.\nMaybe just one more playthrough...",

      "I remembered when I was 8, back then I used to play this on my PS3. It was one of the first RPG games i've ever played aside from Pokemon on GameBoy / Nintendo DS. This game made me feel like I'm in an another world back then. I had dreams of my companion and Drippy. It was such a nostalgic moment when I opened this game, and I was abit sad because I wished that I could turn back time and finish this game when I was a kid. I wasn't able to finish it at that time due to my brother taking away the PS3 overseas. Because now, after getting older, there are so many responsibilities that I must hold on to. Playing games like this during childhood truly changes the vibe of experiencing it. Now I only got a glimpse of it when I opened it for an hour or so. Maybe one day I'll finish this game, once I'm free from reality.",
      "it's a shame but i honestly cannot recommend this game if you are a disabled person, i wasn't that far into the game when my character started panicking apon seeing a disabled person [person with leg braces] and then gets a \"no good answer\" bit of dialog and all the options are saying something wrong or saying nothing, trying to go with the least bad option aside from saying nothing since i know as a disabled person myself [i'm a wheelchair user] it can be pretty upsetting getting people just randomly stare at me and at least when they say something slightly wrong they are engaging with me as a person, my character then proceeds to talk abt what an \"inspiration\" it is 2 c a disabled person living their life,,, not exaggerating when i say i let my head hit the desk, closed the game and uninstalled, i understand that this is probably put in the game to be a teachable moment for the able bodied audience but ironically in trying to educate about us disabled people they then made the assumption that no disabled people would be playing their game as there is no option to make your character disabled or even to make them remotely aware of disability and ended up just making the experience awful for the disabled gamers they seem to be trying to help",

      "I cannot belive the Q_Q from the negative reviews... so many spoiled little brats or total internet nooobs that do not know any better...... just mind boggling...... beyond words......\n\nGreat game even for early access, spent all my time so far solo on my own PVE solo game, will be playing with my friend(s) later.... a few hit box detection issues, if you load your bow and abort you will have the arrow in your hand no matter what you try and do, even with the axe in your hand the arrow will still be there til death... so just minior little things like that so far... \n\nFantastic graphics, I have everything on ultra and no issues, makes for some really great screenshots.... \n\nNo nudity, partial nudity (topless and loin cloth), and full nudity... tastful nudity as in \"female full nudes are especially lovely and artful\", cannot really say the same for the male character nudes however..... may have seen some.... questionable gifs or images floating around already... so I think that side of thing could have been take care of a bit better than that and made more tasteful since some images are \"questionable\" and quite Porographic... so that will leave a nasty impression of the game for many hopful customers and a stain on the Conan universe....\n\nHad little or no issues with buildings... I built a 3 story houe, last top room was 2 blocks high so do not feel cramped... I built a good long bridge to a big high wide rock, took about 4 pillers and they were about 4-5 blocked high and about 3-4 blocks apart... so good bridges are very possible to keep high and out of danger from NPCs at least and to make good use of tall rocks for base extentions... one issue I have is with stairs, you cannot have a ceiling block and a hole for the starts otherwise you head with get stuck and you cannot pass up the stairs... but you can crouch for a sec and go up the stairs... so a minior bug\n\nSooooo much potential for this game, sooooo many possibilities for this game, the sky is the limit... Devs are on the RIGHT TRACK !!.... I love the total freedom for those that want PvE or those that want PvP, many server configurations to play with to how you like, if you play solo you can even play around with the Admin features and go nuts building amazing buildings, spawn NPCs of all types and numbers.... I love the freedom, many games do not give you this much freedom to play how you want to play and that is how things should be....\n\nGood work Devs....

      "As i previously stated, i was going to play through metro fully and i have done so, so here is my update to this review. \nThis game is not the best selling triple A game in the world and it may have some bugs (like a table that wasnt solid or the objects in that room lol) however it is a decent game. the story is decent and the characters voices are way off but they sorta make up for it with their personalities. \n\nExploration in this game is by far one of the most interesting in my opinion and the way your character acts in the enviroment makes it more interesting aswell, for example wiping your visor when it gets dirty (wasnt that helpful for me in my play through but it was a nice touch) and your visor taking damage in combat adds to the immersive feel of this wasteland/paradise almost. Scavenging weapons and parts and combining them to make better equipment is quite intriguing and quick to do if you can find the parts. \n\nat the end of the day my final review of this is its a good game i would play it again even if it is a bit clunky sometimes (atleast it was for me lmao)\n\n\n\n\n\nOh and hopefully my punctuation is good enough so no one passes out this time lmao",
      "This game is utter trash, a classic example of a terrible game that exists only to make the developer money on card sales. There are no options for audio and video settings, the textures and font are ugly as hell, and the controls stink. You move a glowing ball of light around and pass through various colored laser barriers. There are enemies who dim your light on the first hit, and kill you on the second. The instructions are barely above gibberish, with instructions like \"color change to spend the wall color\" and \"use the right button mouse for charge and defend\". You eventually piece together that those instructions mean \"touch the colored balls of light to change the color of your light to match the laser barriers in order to pass through them without dying\" and \"stand on the button and right click to power up laser barriers to protect yourself from the small enemy lights that chase you relentlessly when you get too close\". That second one is only theoretical though, as in practice it's impossible to escape the enemy lights fast enough to have time to charge the defensive laser barriers, so I have no proof that they actually destroy the enemies. On top of all that, the game occasionally gets stuck after you die a few times on the same level, and there's nothing to be done except restart from the very beginning on the tutorial levels. There's the potential for an interesting puzzle game here, but the execution is so bad I can't recommend this junk even for the price of two cents that I paid.",

      "Ever fire up a game for the first time and within the first twenty or so minutes you know it’s got its hooks sunk into you? Return of the Obra Dinn had that effect on me, and that was only elevated by going into it mostly ignorant as to what the game is. The last thing I was expecting was a game to flex the parts of my brain involving deduction, logic and reasoning; parts I haven’t used since the first Pheonix Wright game. I lost track of how many times I’ve had lightbulb epiphanies or gasped with a sudden realization, a kind of excitement I seldom encounter in gaming. Obra Dinn doesn’t have a time limit, so meandering through the creaky ship at your own pace can be something of a relaxing experience - Though investigating a copious number of murders might shake those relaxed feelings.\n\nI’d classify Return of the Obra Dinn as a nautical investigative story walker. The goal of the game is simple: A ship, the titular Obra Dinn, has returned from a voyage but is completely abandoned with apparent signs of foul play having taken place. Your character’s job is to investigate what happened to the ship, its crew and cargo. This may sound dull, but once you arrive on the ship you’re quick to find out there’s very little to go off of; a skeleton here, signs of a struggle there… The game takes place in a time when commerce and trade by sea was at its peak under monarchy crowns, so there’s no fingerprint dusting or CSI kits to be had here - That’s when the supplied compass comes into play. Using this apparently cursed/enchanted/mystical trinket, you can dip back in time when looking at a deceased person at the moment before/during when they died. Get your gumshoe hat on, because what occurs after is only the audio of the scene (voices, noises) followed by depositing you into the scene, though everything is at a stand still like a freeze frame. Using the previous sound clues and the locked-in-time environment around you, the task becomes finding out two whos’ and a how: Who is this person, who (or what, potentially) killed them, and how did they die?  \n\nThe Obra Dinn is a big ship and an accordingly big crew to go along with it. While some members are easily identified by audible hints and where they work/reside on the ship, others aren’t so clear cut. Keeping track of the dozens of crew members isn’t a daunting pain thanks to the handy log book at your disposal, separating each major development with the Obra Dinn’s voyage as chapters that can be revisited or reviewed. This is beneficial because each scene only lets you explore a very limited portion of the ship, so narrowing down who and what you can investigate keeps one from tripping over every bit of available information. Getting lost on the ship isn’t a problem thanks to frequent backtracking and the supplied deck map, and even with the single toned color scheme of the graphics, everyone and everything can be clearly identified. In some cases where the scene has a lot of action going on, the graphical style can suffer a bit from visual pollution, but it’s not frequent enough to hamper your sleuthing.\n\nEntering one scene tends to open up the fate of another person, and it won’t be long until the Obra Dinn resembles one giant crime scene with how many bodies there are. The log book doesn’t instantly indicate whether an assumption about a victim’s fate and their killer is correct or not, as getting ‘clumps’ of people correct will get them permanently pasted into the book to show that you’re right. Out of the the dozens of people on the ship, I had to resort to a guide to identify at least four of them and I felt frustrated from how the game was stretching regarding their identifiable clues. Still, being able to get through approximately 70% of the game before getting slowed down by the trickier victims shows that the game’s challenge curve is quite generous - If you know for what and where to look. I was genuinely excited whenever my newest guess would result in fanfare and correct confirmation without fail each and every time.\n\nGoing blind into Return of the Obra Dinn, I had little to no idea what I was getting into, especially not a nautical investigation with more than the dangers of mutiny going on. My biggest issue past my slight ire with the late game is with how disappointingly limp of a note the game ends on. One chapter in the log book remains locked until every other possible person is accounted for, and this last chapter only confirms what you might’ve already assumed happened that led to the later climax. As mentioned earlier, it got its hooks into me since during my breaks between playing, I was still thinking about theories and potential guesses for what happened to some of those sailors. Return of the Obra Dinn gets a big recommendation from me if you’re looking for a game that’s slower paced or will stoke the interest of the detective in all of us... Just bear in mind that there’s backtracking out the neck if your patience is rattled by that.",
      "-This game is like the combination of old PC sidescroller like Duke Nukem (pre-3d), NES Contra, and arcade Metal Slug with 80s /90s cyberpunk and action movie tropes.\n-The cheesy humor, plot, and music is top notch. Might look like a shallow nostalgia at a glance but once you played it, they even spiritually nailed the silliness of similar games/story in that era. The guns, the character acting and lines, the costume design, etc.\n-It's not as fast paced as I thought it would be. But actually that makes it relaxing to play. Easy to get into and the challenge is just right for me without being frustrating. \n-I like how the enemies and characters are pretty diverse. \n-I haven't finished the game but I feel like this game will have similar replay value like Streets of Rage 4. Not because of there are many things to do or getting better at the game but because it's somehow just simply tight, fun, and arcadey to replay.",

      "[h1]Old, but has massive depth of content // Recommended for immersive role-players[/h1]\n\n+ Combat in general, and melee combat in particular, is very polished and open for an older title; everything can be controlled, such as directional blocking, without overcomplicating the mechanics involved\n+ Character creation is meticulously in-depth; initial backstory creation works seamlessly with selection of primary attributes in a way that makes the final product always feel refreshingly unique\n+ 'Story' is about as open-ended as can be, to the point where the game essentially has no story, and is something of a thirteenth century sand-box title; the player has complete, unadulterated freedom\n+ The game encourages the player to recruit and build a personal army as he/she progresses, and the mechanics put in place for doing so are well-rounded and complex\n+ Extremely easy and satisfying to mod; highly recommended\n+ Sorting and commanding one's troops is key, and the player would do well to benefit fromt he excellent command mechanics of the game; strategy is massively important and competently implemented\n+ Economics of the game add another layer of challenge to the game; trade and balancing one's income against one's expenses are both crucial elements to consider\n+ Multiplayer is fairly standard, run-of-the-mill stuff, but it's still densely populated and everything seems to connect well; the charm of the game, and its solid combat system, keep the players coming back in droves after more than five years\n\n- Politics, which are interesting and engaging in scope, end up being a somewhat weaker feature in practice, as NPCs are largely static during negotiations; this does break the immersion slightly, as it seems that your successes are based purely on stats, and not on the actual implications of one's choices\n- Quests often become tedious and repetitive\n- Tutorial is underwheling and largely insufficient to introduce the more in-depth mechanics that will be used outside of combat\n- Visuals are outdated and didn't stand well the test of time; even for the year of release, the textures and polygon counts are well below par\n\n[h1]LockeProposal's Big Day Out[/h1]\n\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/bigdayout#]Community Group[/url]\n[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/7611703/]Curator Page[/url]\n[url=https://www.reddit.com/r/SeriousSteamReviews/]Serious Steam Reviews subReddit[/url]",
      "Fun Tower-Defense style indie game. Definitely one where your skill improves every time you die. And you will die, repeatedly. :P Expect to try out many monster combinations per floor before you find something that can delay the hordes of adventurers long enough to set up the floor beneath! I would probably enjoy some more horizontal progression + permanent upgrades for long term re-playability, but it seems like a solo dev/small scoped project. Definitely worth the price for the current amount of content!",
      "TLDR: Right now, since there are no \"NEUTRAL\" reviews on Steam, IN IT'S CURRENT STATE, its a no from me. If the bugs get ironed out, its a pretty good game. If it gets fixed, I'll likely change to a recommend.\n\nGot 2 copies as a Fig Backer to play with my brother. My single player experience (POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILERS):\n\nGOOD:\n--Love that the choices REALLY matter and there are a LOT of them in this game.\n--Many different ways to approach a situation and your reputation affects interactions. Your reputation MAY be good enough to talk yourself out of fights! Many opportunities for KISS ASS and HARD ASS and other Squad builds (Nerd stuff, Mechanics, etc.) to be useful throughout the game.\n--The fire modes have grown on me. Some weapons have their own perks which add a fire mode. Other fire modes are available via perks you can obtain in the perk tree. The Precision Strike you get once your strike meter is full is very powerful and can change a fight (can malfunction a robot with aimed shot or fire a huge burst to take out multiple hostiles).\n--You can build a new squad member at any time that will start at your current level. Messed up a squad member build? That's okay, just create a new one.\n--I like the PREPARE and AMBUSH abilities. PREPARE lets you save up to 2 AP for next turn. The AMBUSH ability allows your squad members to trade in some AP to fire on an enemy that enters their range during hostile turns.\n--I love the Animal Whisperer skill and animal companions. I like the variety of animals you can bring along with your squad.\n--Shift key to highlight stuff you can interact with. This takes away having to pixel hunt for obscured boxes and containers. When you get old and can't see as well you appreciate stuff like this.\n--I like that I only have to loot one body at the end of combat and I can easily cycle through and grab the loot from all the other lootable bodies in the area.\n--A high Luck attribute will occasionally result in more loot, and even free actions. Sometimes you'll get a free attack or a free movement from a lucky action.\n--I like the variety and usefulness of Utilities (+5% XP, +2 PER, +1 Weapon/Armor modding, etc.)\n--A lot of stuff that can be used for cover can also be shot and destroyed.\n--Humor can be a bit over-the-top, but I've chortled quite a few times.\n\nNOT SURE:\n--Can only charm a single animal per squad member with Animal Whisperer. You CAN get other special animal followers that don't count as the single. While disappointed, I can see why they limited it (more would be OP and they can start to get in the way during combat).\n--Enemies have a circular view area, which means even if you're trying to sneak past behind them, you can still be \"seen\" after a brief time.\n\nBAD/BUGS:\n--Cant team crouch. You have to manually go through all of your squad and crouch them 1 by 1, and it costs 2 AP to crouch in combat. You also cant move crouched as far as I know. You can't \"change stances\" (AKA crouch or stand up) while in cover, either. Save a game right before a fight with all your squad members crouched and ready to go? When combat locks up and you have to load the save, you have to re-crouch everybody.\n--Combat can lock up, causing you to have to reload a previous save (for me, twice per play session usually but sometimes twice for the same fight).\n--Attributes, Skills, Combat Buffs/Debuffs (and probably other stuff) need more tool tips.\n--Lost character progression.\n--Very laggy Dialogue Tree and later in the game the inventory gets laggy too.\n--Creating a Bookworm Squad Member with 1 STR creates a situation where your Squad Member is losing 3 CON (total hit points) every level up and will be erased like Marty McFly in B2TF.\n--Load screens are too long. 30+ seconds to load into different zones, over 1.5 minutes to load a game on SSD. From another review: \"while we wait, let us read the lore books we've collected.\"\n--Squad portraits don't stay in order.\n--When you have more than 6 Ranger recruits in the select character screen, the \"Companions\" section gets pushed off-screen, hiding their portraits, and making it very unintuitive to add them back into your squad (you have to use the keyboard). Need a scroll bar here.\n--Saves don't have specific names so can be easily overwritten. There is only 1 autosave by default, and later on the game autosaves right after a game changing decision, making you have to revert to a manual save (2 hours earlier for me) if you wanted to try different options. I recommend turning on timed saves as well as taking advantage of quicksaves (and of course saving often!)\n--FPS drops, sometimes so bad you have to reload.\n--Squad Members shooting through walls/floors/ceilings.\n--Radiation difficult to detect in some areas and no warning (other than your squad health draining) going from radiation level 2 to 3 for instance.\n--Combat messages briefly appear above your acting Squad Member's head and are easy to miss (like \"Out of Range\")\n--When getting shot at, the camera doesn't always auto focus on who is shooting you.\n--At least three bugged missions I can think of (but hey, one is an unlimited money glitch so more of a feature).\n--Character models and other things (switches) not loading properly leading to invisible characters you can interact with (or fight with, as it happens in combat sometimes too).\n--The game can become unresponsive when trying to move 2 Squad Members separately and interact with someone.\n--Explosive Barrels not actually exploding when shot (this seems to be related to being too far away from the barrel when sniping it, as if you get closer, they'll actually explode).\n--Cybernetic Implants are a good idea, but they take up your Utility Slot instead of giving you another slot dedicated to them so when you have the ability to finally use them, it feels more like a trade-off rather than an augmentation.\n--No Inventory filter for Utilities. Gotta scroll through your hundreds of items and the Utilities aren't even grouped together entirely in the inventory, they are scattered throughout.\n--When you open a door to a closed room, fog of war usually obscures what is in the room until you physically walk a squad member into the room.\n--Cannot have multiple types of the same animal in a Squad with multiple Animal Whisperers.\n--Don't try to loot two containers at once.\n--Some traps can't be disarmed.\n--Various graphic glitches like missing texture or dialogue bubbles that are blank or don't disappear.\n--Can't remove and reuse weapon mods.\n--Some equipped weapons will display inflated damage numbers (by 300% in some cases) until re-equipped. Not even sure how long it has been that way or if it was affecting my game.\n--If you misclick the filter categories in a vendor encounter on the World Map, it'll kick you out of the encounter to the radio and you can't get back to the random encounter at that time. I only mention this since I've done it so many times.\n--You can't pause the game which may or may not affect time sensitive quests. You can be detected and attacked in the menu (escape key) or in your inventory.\n--There is no way to have Special companions/followers that you get from Missions follow a different squad member. If you dump that Squad Member later, you lose the follower too (as far as I know).\n--Get radio signals with \"coordinates to follow\" yet I have no clue who from or what it opened up on the map (if anything).\n--Gaining access to certain parts of the Rangers HQ requires you to do something pretty awful.\n--I'm out of room....\n\nIt feels like I'm fighting against the game more than the Wasteland sometimes. I don't even want to try multiplayer until it gets fixed (and my brother doesn't either).\n\nIf you're a developer of this game, thank you for your time and effort! Polish it up and I'll be happy to change this to a recommend! Edited for clarity/additions and I cut a lot. Thank you for reading and thank you for the comments and awards! Have a great day and be kind to others.",

The game works fine, and the controls are solid, by that I mean you do feel in control, even though I only played a little I died a lot, but it never felt unfair. You get to do a lot of customization, and it is fun, but I just don't have the right temper for games where you die a lot. 7/10.",

      "The problem with a lot of Steam reviews is that they don't really help you figure out whether you should buy / try the game. So, let me help. You are one of four people:\n\n(1) You've never played a Sam Barlow game before, and you've never played a point-and-click adventure game before. In which case, what's wrong with you?\n\n(2) You've never played a Sam Barlow game, but you have played a point-and-click adventure game before. In which case, you'll definitely know within two hours whether you like this game. But anyways, you're getting a decent bit of stuff for $20.\n\n(3) You've played a Sam Barlow game, and you didn't like it. In which case, you probably won't like this either. It's basically the same thing as Her Story and Telling Lies, but with a different story.\n\n(4) You've played a Sam Barlow game, and you did like it. In which case, you probably will like this too.

      "good game but later missions seem to be less polished ran in multiple bugs when playing as The Son enemies getting stuck in impossible to reach places and for some odd reason some characters have dog killing animations that for the most part are bugged and only work half the time causing an insta death and a retry don't even understand why later in the game you have to do animations to kill dogs as for basically the whole game you don't need to perform animations also seems to have some input lag throughout the whole game but overall its decent and when its on sale you should buy it.",
      "imagine a AAA-RPG game in 2021 w/o game breaking bugs.\n\nonly problem i have with this game is the monetization aka MTX, you can buy Gald, boost items, straight up level ups etc, i personally do not care if a game has those buyable options or not HOWEVER when you constantly get it shoved in your face it's suuuuper annoying, start up the game, ! symbol on the main menu, leading to... yes the steam store, if this would be the only encounter i'd still be fine with it but it isn't, rest on bonfires and you have yet another icon with the ! symbol trying to get you to buy any of the boosters or outfits or whatnot.\n\ngenerally speaking this game is fantastic, soundtrack, graphics, VAs, cutscenes etc. however the MTX ads in the game that remind me more of the \"hey click this\" approach of mobile games is horrible, should have kept it in the main menu but keep it out of my actual gameplay.",
      "I'm 45, I've had good times and bad times.  I've fallen in love, grown up, gotten married, beaten alcoholism, \nhad a child, fought off depression, led my wife through her kidney failure, carried the death of loved ones, and come back from the brink.  I've weathered the storm of life like anyone else . . . I'm not special.  I'm not rich, but comfortable, and I've gathered quite a steam library as a hobby over the last 10 years.  Something I have rarely done, during my time with almost 4000 titles, is write a review.  Two, maybe three for 4000 games.  Think about that for a second.\n\nI'm 45.  I just cried playing a video game, something I can't ever remember doing.  I feel like my heart is going to burst.  It's joy, and sadness.  It's like a good memory with a parent who's long gone, bubbled up at random, making you laugh and ache at the same time.  It's bittersweet.\n\nThe music and visuals are subtle and flashy at the same time, they get under you and lift you up.  It's got spirit of the 60's, the heart of the 80's, and feels like every memorable video game trope from the 2000's, with the social softness of the 2020's.  It's huge and tiny at the same time, and thoughtfull and meditative together . . . it tells the story of leaving your comfort zone, and makes you comfortable.  It's heavy and light.  It's all of these and more.\n\nMy emotions are a flood.  I had to write a review, and let people know how I feel.  I can't describe it, I feel like I found my heart again, and I didn't even know it was lost.  Life was comfortable before 2:00pm today . . . now it's magical.  It's these small things that I forget, and remember, and then forget again . . . the birth of my son, the feeling of nervous sweetness on my first date with my wife, an unexpected comment from a random stranger about my eyes, finding an old photo of my dad that no one ever remembered taking --\n\n-- This game is like that sweet, fleeting memory.\n\nTL;DR:  45-year old man cries after finding his heart lost in a game, and writes a review while his wife asks him if he's okay.\n\n11/10, would purchase these feels again.",
      "This game was so much fun but it's borderline unplayable a lot of the time due to no region lock. You get a lot of players from china playing on NA servers and they're basically untouchable due to ping. I genuinely think this game has fantastic game play and the characters and customization are top notch but spawning and dying to untouchable Chinese players every match just ruins the experience no matter how much I try to enjoy it. Not worth until they region lock the game or unless you want maybe a few hours of fun until you run into 我操你妈 every game and die to reasons out of your control.",
      "As the holder of a degree in Plant Sciences, I wholeheartedly endorse this game.\n\nReal talk: One of the best things about this game is how it totally commits to the old-timey apothecary/greenhouse theme-- it’s extremely atmospheric. It also has a compelling story with recurring characters that you can affect with your choices. If the prospect of discovering and using plants to solve problems (or mayhap even a grim mystery) appeals to you, I recommend trying this game.",
      "Volition ups the silly, and adds super powers, but loses a little something along the way.\n\nI loved Saint's Row: the Third, and by all rights should have loved IV as well, but I mostly just liked it. The set up was fun, and seemed to up the ante again, but then you get the presidency ripped away from you almost immediately (without even seeing the consequences of your first pushed legislation!). Placing the game in a virtual city for the most part with the only real characters being on your space ship, really kinda seemed to gut the game. Even when [spoiler]the world gets destroyed[/spoiler], a detached, \"meh\" was all I could muster. The humor is there, but it's mostly better in the DLC. The radio stations feel kind of underwhelming without DJs.\n\nFinally all the fun of collecting and customizing various interesting cars, and finding ways to climb or fall to interesting places with a stolen plane/parachute are gutted with the inclusion of super powers. Also, the super powers make gunplay, leveling any of your other stuff, and pretty much every mechanic carried over from Saints Row: the Third obsolete.\n\nIf you get this game, do yourself a favor and make sure you get all the DLC where most of the real fun is. Is it as good as the previous Saints Row? I don't think so, but I still recommend getting it and playing through it. It is a lot of fun, and I love the 50's break out scenario at the beginning.\n\nStacey's thoughts:\nStill awaiting DLC with Jane Austin and the D*ldo Bat. Can somebody make this, for, uhh, scientific purposes.",
      "I have a hard time recommending this game because even though I liked it, I know it's the kind of thing that can only appeal to a very small demographic :/ Anyway, I believe small devs who try weird things deserve all the exposure they can get, so here's a review. This is the second episode of a series (the first one can be found [url=https://etherane.itch.io/hello-charlotte-ep1]here[/url] - it's free - and the last one is [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/760890/Hello_Charlotte_Childhoods_End/]on Steam[/url]). It's recommended to play them in order unless you don't want to understand anything in a story that's already pretty confusing in itself.\n\n+ Very original visuals. The artwork is mostly composed of cute characters, but there are writhing masses of eyes and flesh everywhere (guro fans rejoice). Areas are arranged into colorful, geometrical patterns similar to Mondrian's paintings.\n\n+ The setting is extremely strange. It's definitely dystopian, but it can go from completely silly to incredibly tragic in a matter of seconds.\n\n+ Production values increase with each episode. I wasn't very impressed with the first game (apart from its artwork, which I loved, and its ending, which... opened interesting possibilities), but starting from this one the writing gets way better, the characters are more developed, and the gameplay feels more focused.\n\n+ - Hello Charlotte is more or less Trigger Warning Land. This series is among the most disturbing things I have ever played, and it's not because of the omipresent gore (most of it being used for aesthetics or comedy instead of shock value). It deals with heavy themes (mental illness, social pressure, bullying, suicide, the value of life and death - from what I could gather, a lot of these come from the author's personal experience) and it felt so suffocating sometimes I had to play in short bursts to give me time to recover. I note this as both a positive and a negative, since I consider games that can make me uncomfortable are valuable - but don't play this if you're not sure you can handle it.\n\n- The gameplay mostly consists of going back and forth to the same locations, and can sometimes feel tedious. Sadly I don't really think this can be improved unless the game is changed into a full visual novel, but it would mean losing the environments.\n\n8/10 It's a weird game made for weird people.",
      "Emily is Away Too is the sequel to Emily is Away.\n\nThe first game, which was free to play, was absolutely fantastic, especially because of its finale: [spoiler] no matter what you felt or what you wanted to do, your choices would always bring the same conclusion of you unable to say to Emily that you wanted to be more than friends, and her spending the summer with her boyfriend. [/spoiler]\nBut that was not because of \"lazyness\" by the developer: it was intentional, and in fact, towards the end of the game, [spoiler] even if you try expressing your feelings your character would delete what you wanted to say replacing the messages with generic questions [/spoiler] . In my opinion, the intention was to deliver the message that [spoiler] sometimes in life, especially when dealing with relationships with other people, there is simply nothing you can do except accepting other people's choices and move on [/spoiler] .\nIt was a very powerful ending that left me thinking about it for days after finishing the game, even if it was a short experience.\n\nUnfortunately, while playing this game I did not feel the same, powerful emotions that I did with the first one. This is because the game features several different endings, this time with two girls instead of just Emily, which isn't a bad thing per se, but it contrasts with the power of the message of the first one. Moreover, here [spoiler] you can actually achieve not one, but several \"good\" endings [/spoiler] .\n\nI liked the integration with your desktop and browser, plus the many different references to artists, TV shows and movies from 10 years ago.\nThere are still some \"twists\" present here, and if you make certain choices you will encounter situations similar to what you do in the first game, but as I said, I feel that they are not as effective as the original game.\n\nThat does not mean this is a bad game by any means: I would still recommend it, especially for its low price, but make sure to download and play the previous one first. It's free, too!\n\nRating: 7.0/10",
      "The amount of love and fun that went into this game is astounding. If you like minigames, memes, fun, and a challenge, check this game out. The “ending” was a bit lackluster, in my opinion, but it did not taint my views on the game and I had an overwhelmingly fun time with it. Definitely recommend!",
      "2023...\n\n2 years...\n\n2 Languages...\n\nEDIT:\n\nTLDR: Game is too simple, better get Factorio or Riftbreaker\n\n\nPlayed again after ~1 year, nothing has changed in the basic QoL or coding system.\n\n\n- It still uses an older builder system than Factorio did 10 years ago: you actually have to craft the base material manually every time before you can build the building, instead of it being done automatically by a simple click on the building in the build menu.\n\n- If you have crafting orders set, new items added to your inventory will not be read by the current crafting orders and keeps on produce stuff your already own...\n\n- Items don't have their own output for transport lines, but instead require this stupid additional output... (I think the developer couldn't create a better output than this simple one)\n\n\n20 minutes and that's enough for me for now, I'm not putting in any more effort for EA project",
      "It has poor simulation of hand skeleton, so you can't use all fingers, benefits of Index Knuckles controller or VR gloves, etc. And, scenario doesn't allow you to do anything, actually, except one straightforward way. Some things are elaborated, but mostly it isn't worth time or money. But I'm rating it as professional developer for VR, sexual content itself is not matter nor interested for me. My advice for game developer is to add more hand tracking features and more scenarios - in this case it can be something better.",

I've had to stop playing this game until they patch it because right now you're just managing bugs and glitches and you will have to design hospitals to get around these bugs, so that means extra wide corridors and spacing items out so people don't get stuck.

      "Finally, a video game that is everything televangelists in the 90’s said that video games were. Exactly what my Christian mother would love to catch me playing.\n\nIt’s like Animal Crossing and Doom\nEternal had a son… as was foretold when they released on the same day.\n\nThis game really makes you FEEL like you’re sacrificing your friends to an almighty force. Would I really just sacrifice 5 of my friends  again for some loot chests? I’m a gamer, of course I would.\n\nI fell in love with the aesthetic of this game instantly. It was brilliant when the gameplay held up to those expectations.  \n\nI loved it. I loved the art. The humor. The theme. The premise. The combat. The cult management. Sacrifices. Collecting the bones of my enemies. The juice visual effects. Most of all I loved feeding my followers bowls of poop.\n\nThe combat is fun but definitely not the meat of the game. Building your cult and just upgrading stuff is quite satisfying.  There's some goofy stuff to laugh at and it's quick and responsive. There’s something about the music that makes you feel relaxed and in terrible danger all at the same time.\n\nThis is not a game that you're gonna put 50-100 hours in either.  Which to me is a big plus.  Most of the runs don't take you more than 15 minutes.  So it's an easy game to pick up and play for a bit and jump back in later. It's like Vampire Survivors in that regard.\n\nIt's basically Animal Crossing with a roguelite twist. I could say it's almost original how those elements were combined.\nIt's great entertainment, all around. You could even say the game is bound to become a cult classic…\n\n10/10",

It does a lot of unexpected things and gamifies some deep and haunting concepts within the human psyche( the game centers around a POWERFUL subject, very hard to discuss without spoiling the game), sports combat that's tough but honestly very satisfying at times through the use of unorthodox party members and antagonists, but the rpg economy, pacing, and sheer grinding within tends to rob a lot of scenes of their emotional impact. I had a lot of fun with Jimmy, but honestly speaking I don't know if I could recommend this game to anyone who isn't used to a big jrpg-length commitment.\n\nIt's not so much that I hated the grinding, but it's that you're presented with symbolically themed enemies (not crazy about a lot of the in-battle art, some of it is phenomenal but a lot of it feels half baked which is something Kasey O has discussed in interviews but this is besides the point) Enemies an make you think and elicit actual emotions...\n\n...but then you have to stare at them for hours as you grind to be able to even last a few turns against each new boss. I found myself resorting to [spoiler]Clean Getaway[/spoiler] a lot throughout the game just to get to the other side of a room in a manageable timeframe. The symbolism loses its impact very quickly, and the momentum of the story is constantly slamming on the brakes to make you grind, and to me, it just dulls the sharp edges off of a lot of otherwise deeply impactful moments. It robs itself.\n\nIt'll present you with something powerful, but then it'll do that 30 more times before the end of a dungeon and it can become a bit tiring, like someone telling you the same knock-knock joke over and over.\n\n[spoiler]Shinryu[/spoiler] and certain aspects of [spoiler]The Pulsating Central Hub[/spoiler] are definitely some of the more outstanding examples.\n\nalso [spoiler]Heart Prison[/spoiler] is a ridiculous ask of a player. You finish the game and can wipe out any leftover superbosses at around Lv.60, and the [spoiler]family battle[/spoiler] requires Lv.90+. I'm not going to sit down and literally grind for 30 levels for the only battle left that I could watch on YouTube in 3 minutes.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I really loved this game, it brought me to tears at points. SO much work was clearly put into this and I'm scouring the rest of Kasey's work right now to get more of this excellent writing, I but I feel like Jimmy just barely misses the mark when viewed as a whole package. Any RPGmaker/Earthboundlike fans are sure to enjoy, and I can't stop thinking about the story, but as a gaming experience, I'd hesitate a little to recommend it.",
      "[strike][h1]Best Sex Language Synonym Reference Book 2016, 10/10[/h1][/strike]\n\n-Nah. Not really.\n\nEdit: Upon completing this game, here's something I'll have to claim in advance: while still recommending this great game with an 8 out of 10 and it has quite a solid story, I'll have to admit  that apart from Dorothy's hidden scenario, this game did not dig very deep into its cyberpunk/dystopian background, which is really a pity - and it's becoming the reason to expect another game (more specifically, A [b]SEQUEL[/b]!!!!! or prequel) from them :)\n\nVA-11 Hall-A - or Valhalla for convenience - while seemingly was a Waifu Bartending Simulation game, is actually somewhat [i]Papers, Please[/i] with excellent characters, vivid graphics, elaborated dialogues and not-so-mind-fucking gaming mechanics.\n\nDon't get me wrong: I love [i]Papers, Please[/i] and of course would rather NOT say that one is superior to another; they are both one of their unique kind, but with the very same root - under the daily life of dystopia denizens, truth and conspiracies weave with vague notices in advance; and just before you could think twice things are going really, really out of track.\n\nThat being said, I mean these two games are very similiar in story-telling: as long as you enjoy taking in all the random, weird stories as a bystander, just to find out that all these fragments come together and form a bigger picture, this game is definitely for you. And you get cyberpunk waifus, a Joshikousei hologram, a pretty cool onêchan as protagonist - and more!\n\nLast but not least, the developers of this game are nothing but truly [b]RESPECTABLE[/b]. We have crybabies on Kickstarter and Steam Early Access every focking day blaming everything for their faulty products, while this army of two whined [b]NOTHING[/b] about all the fuck-ups in Venezuela unless asked. Game dalayed? Only apologies, no excuses. That deserves a huge fricking medal and Developer of The Year.\n\nGrab the game if you want some real relax and good story before they grab Dorothy.

Even when you are simply running in and out, it's going be a lot of fun.

The search functionality is soooo good; as a casual player, it is the sole reason I stopped playing Mario Maker 1. Mario Maker 2 is better, but it still falls terribly short. I think the best part is that Levelhead gives people control over the visibility of their levels, as well as incentives to play other peoples, and that is something that SMM2 unfortunately lacks.",

      "A criminally underrated game, I have seldom seen a developer take their original hit which was already almost perfect, and actually manage to improve on it in every way shape and form. You do not need to have played the original to play or enjoy this game. Their stories are completely seperate.\n\nThe game itself is much less linear than its predecessor. The best way I can explain the feeling of going through the environments without referencing Grimrock itself is by saying it felt an awful lot like Myst to me, just with combat. Required puzzles for progression were challenging but not impossible, some of the secret challenges were much more difficult. I admit I used an online guide more than a few times, but it did nothing to diminish my enjoyment of the game. It is immersive, challenging, and satisfying. \n\nThe only drawback I can think of is the difficulty. It feels like you cannot win with any group composition, I suggest no more than 2 of any class or weapon/armor type user. I went with a warrior, two rogues(one range), and a mage, this way you as well makes you unlikely to complete a difficult fight or puzzle and be rewarded with something you cannot use. Combat itself can be challenging as I said, but you will rarely feel like you are simply incapable of winning. There are obvious ways to optimize the way you approach an encounter the second time if you die the first.\n\nBe prepared to immerse yourself, you must pay attention to your surroundings, read and remember notes you find, explore every nook and cranny you can find, and you will be rewarded. Good luck!\n",
      "I honestly didn't think this was going to hook me as much as it did. There's something so charming about this game that I honestly can't quite pinpoint to one central thing. The characters, the art, the writing, the plot, the setting.... They're all fantastic. I haven't run into a supporting character that I dislike at all (minor characters excluded, WEIRD BOILED PEANUTS STRANGER ON THE BUS). There's a lot of layers and depth to the characters! \n\nExcept the weird boiled peanuts stranger on the bus. But we don't talk about him. Or his weird boiled peanuts. \n\nThe writing in particular I have to sing praises about. It has an excellent comedic edge to it and there's so many great lines. SO MANY. Scarlet Hollow also delivers on something a lot of other \"choice/decision\" games fail to execute: Your choices actually do matter. There's some REAL serious consequences to certain choices! Some of which are immediately apparent, some of which haven't shown up yet (but it's strongly suggested a lot of the choices you make will come back around in the later episodes). It's almost like a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure book; there's so many different little things you can choose that will affect other things. Each episode can end in vastly different outcomes.\n\nPart of what adds to the writing are the Traits you can choose when starting the game. You get to pick two out of seven, and these can affect dialogue or open up certain options you otherwise wouldn't have access to. In some cases having a particular trait can even massively swing things in your favor, where otherwise it might be a lot more difficult to get the desired outcome you want. \n\nALSO you can choose a trait that lets you talk to animals though and you get to meet Best Friend Dustin if you do. And you get the most hilarious dialogue options. It's The Best.\n\nI honestly won't even go into detail about the story. Talking about it ruins the whole point! But needless to say it's very good, and it hooked me real good. It's been going unexpectedly cool places that have been totally outside of my predictions.\n\nAs an aside, I've always been a fan of the horror aesthetic in general, but so many horror games end up trying to make you piss your pants in fear; which isn't what I'm after in a horror game. But Scarlet Hollow absolutely nails the atmospheric tension of the horror aesthetic. It's eerie and terrifying and tense, all without relying on cheap jumpscares or, actual scares. It's great if, like me, you like the theme of horror but hate being scared. It'll keep you on the edge of your seat, but rest assured your pants will remain dry.\n\nAlso there's Romance Options. A WHOLE LOT. I'm gonna smooch Stella and we're gonna hunt Cryptids together and it'll be RAD.",

      "[h1]Strategy at its finest[/h1]\n\nInto the Breach is Subset Game’s latest title, following on from their massive hit, FTL. I put off trying Into the Breach for a long while, but I finally got it when it dropped down to $10 on HB a couple of months ago and I’m so glad I did. This game isn’t for everyone, it’s kind of rogue-like mech chess, but if it clicks for you then it’ll be one of the best strategy games you’ll ever play.\n\n[h1]Positives:[/h1]\n[list][*]First up, the game looks fantastic. The pixel art here is great, from the backgrounds to the mechs and even the pilot portraits. The animations here area also really good. There’s nothing too complicated here but it’s all well executed. On the topic of appearances, I also really like the way the maps are laid out, the 8x8 grids on a plain background work really well here and it reminds me of simple boardgames. I think it works well for the game.\n\n[*]As with any good strategy game, it’s easy to pick up, but hard to master. You have a squad of three mechs (there are a few different mech groups to unlock with gold coins (?) and you can also create custom groups from the mechs you’ve unlocked). Each group has a unique element, but they all follow the basic structure of one close-range mech, one long-range mech and one support mech. Each mech has a different ability/weapon and they’re all well varied. The mech teams are really well designed here so that no one mech is super powerful and they all work really well as a unit. \n\n[*]The combat is excellent. It’s really simple but it works so well. You’ll quickly learn the different roles your mechs have and figure out the best strategies to use them. There are two ways to kill most enemies. Getting rid of all of their HP or pushing them into water/lava (with the exception of boss enemies or flying enemies). However, a lot of the time you probably won’t even be trying to kill your enemies in a given turn. You can always see what the enemies will do on their next turn and so you always want to be playing to react to/prevent their next move. Typically, enemies target civilian buildings or buildings related to your objective, so it’s usually better to focus on moving them away from these buildings rather than focusing on killing them. If you’re really smart/lucky you can also push enemies so that they attack each other, as friendly fire is a major part of this game. It’s really satisfying when you line it up right so the enemies are killing each other rather than attacking you or the buildings you defend. You can even block them from spawning by moving something on top of them!\n\n[*]Unlocks in this game are handled better than in FTL in my opinion. There are six actions that you can complete with each mech squad to earn those gold coins I mentioned in order to unlock new mech squads. The first three are the three possible victories: two, three and four island (more on that in a second) and then the other three achievements are unique to each mech squad. They’re centred around the unique aspect of each squad, tasking you to get a bit creative with the way that you’re playing. I know some players didn’t like the way that unlocks worked but I think it’s a really good way to handle it and encourages you to try new strategies. \n\n[*]The game has five islands, with one of those being the final boss fight. Each island is basically a different biome with different enemies and environmental hazards. They aren’t necessarily easier or harder than each other to start with, but the difficulty does increase as you move from island to island. There is some crossover with the enemies you’ll see, but they at the very least have a different appearance and most of them behave differently. There are also enemies unique to each island. \n\n[*]On each island, you’ll need to complete several missions before facing off against the island’s mini-boss. The missions all have different objectives for you to complete, though the win condition is always just to survive all of the turns (typically 5 turns). The different objectives vary but there are usual two, with some easier missions only having one and harder missions having three. Completing these objectives gets you certain rewards. You can either get stars, which are used upon completing an island to purchase new pilots, abilities or weapons. There is grid power which restores or increases the grid power you start with (grid power is lost when buildings are destroyed, losing all grid power results in a loss). Lastly, some of the missions award power cores (usually you only see this as the third reward for a hard mission) which allow you to upgrade your mech’s weapons or abilities (super handy). The mission variety is fairly good.\n\n[*]There are a range of different pilots in the game. You always start with one ‘special’ pilot and two regular pilots but more can be found in cryo-pods or bought at the end-of-island store. All pilots earn xp at the end of missions and when they level up they get some kind of upgrade, like more mech health or an extra movement per turn. The ‘special’ pilots all have some kind of special ability, such as being able to attack twice if you don’t move or the ability for the piloted mech to fly. Some of these require a power core, but they’re definitely worth it.  [/list]\n\n[h1]Negatives: [/h1]\n[list][*]Honestly, I’m clutching at straws here for negatives. One thing I would mention is that I don’t think this game will have as much replay value as FTL does for most people (completionists have an awful lot to do here) which shouldn’t put you off from getting it, but is something to base your expectations on. I also felt like Chris Avellone was a bit wasted on this game, his writing is fantastic but there just isn’t much of it. [/list]\n\n[h1]Verdict: [/h1]\n\nInto the Breach is as close to a perfect strategy game as I’ve ever played and it’s an excellent follow-up to FTL. This game is easy to pick up, hard to master and it looks beautiful the whole time you’re playing this weird mech chess. I can’t recommend this enough and at $15 it’s an absolute steal. This was easily one of my favourite releases of 2018 and anyone who likes strategy absolutely needs this in their library. \n\nIf you found this review helpful, please check out my other reviews over at [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33633486/]Kemo's Corner.[/url]",
      "For those of you still harbouring hesitations about \"walking simulators\"...here's one I'd definitely recommend you try.\n\n   So yes, it's quite linear, and no, it probably doesn't have an enormous amount of replayability. It's also quite short - about two to three hours - so I guess it's not that cheap at twenty buckaroonies. It is, however, one of the strongest examples of interactive storytelling you will ever enjoy, and an oddly varied experience given the bits of the game in which you briefly get to play the roles of cats, owls, and...well, I don't want to give too much away. Let's just say Tim Burton would be jealous (seeing what a boring old hack he's become these days).\n\n   For anyone who loves a good story in a game, with a willingness to sacrifice a bit of agency in order to have that superior narrative experience...it's a bit of a no-brainer. As for the rest of you, well: you only live once. And they do say variety is the spice of life. So if you only try one walking simulator before dismissing the entire genre, this could well be the one. Truly magical, wonderful stuff. And a bit of a tear-jerker at times, too.\n\nVerdict: 9.5/10.\n\n(PS Anyone claiming there is no \"gameplay\" in this title is either a drooling idiot, or hasn't played the game in its entirety. There's interaction and \"mini-games\" aplenty.)",
      "Ever fire up a game for the first time and within the first twenty or so minutes you know it’s got its hooks sunk into you? Return of the Obra Dinn had that effect on me, and that was only elevated by going into it mostly ignorant as to what the game is. The last thing I was expecting was a game to flex the parts of my brain involving deduction, logic and reasoning; parts I haven’t used since the first Pheonix Wright game. I lost track of how many times I’ve had lightbulb epiphanies or gasped with a sudden realization, a kind of excitement I seldom encounter in gaming. Obra Dinn doesn’t have a time limit, so meandering through the creaky ship at your own pace can be something of a relaxing experience - Though investigating a copious number of murders might shake those relaxed feelings.\n\nI’d classify Return of the Obra Dinn as a nautical investigative story walker. The goal of the game is simple: A ship, the titular Obra Dinn, has returned from a voyage but is completely abandoned with apparent signs of foul play having taken place. Your character’s job is to investigate what happened to the ship, its crew and cargo. This may sound dull, but once you arrive on the ship you’re quick to find out there’s very little to go off of; a skeleton here, signs of a struggle there… The game takes place in a time when commerce and trade by sea was at its peak under monarchy crowns, so there’s no fingerprint dusting or CSI kits to be had here - That’s when the supplied compass comes into play. Using this apparently cursed/enchanted/mystical trinket, you can dip back in time when looking at a deceased person at the moment before/during when they died. Get your gumshoe hat on, because what occurs after is only the audio of the scene (voices, noises) followed by depositing you into the scene, though everything is at a stand still like a freeze frame. Using the previous sound clues and the locked-in-time environment around you, the task becomes finding out two whos’ and a how: Who is this person, who (or what, potentially) killed them, and how did they die?  \n\nThe Obra Dinn is a big ship and an accordingly big crew to go along with it. While some members are easily identified by audible hints and where they work/reside on the ship, others aren’t so clear cut. Keeping track of the dozens of crew members isn’t a daunting pain thanks to the handy log book at your disposal, separating each major development with the Obra Dinn’s voyage as chapters that can be revisited or reviewed. This is beneficial because each scene only lets you explore a very limited portion of the ship, so narrowing down who and what you can investigate keeps one from tripping over every bit of available information. Getting lost on the ship isn’t a problem thanks to frequent backtracking and the supplied deck map, and even with the single toned color scheme of the graphics, everyone and everything can be clearly identified. In some cases where the scene has a lot of action going on, the graphical style can suffer a bit from visual pollution, but it’s not frequent enough to hamper your sleuthing.\n\nEntering one scene tends to open up the fate of another person, and it won’t be long until the Obra Dinn resembles one giant crime scene with how many bodies there are. The log book doesn’t instantly indicate whether an assumption about a victim’s fate and their killer is correct or not, as getting ‘clumps’ of people correct will get them permanently pasted into the book to show that you’re right. Out of the the dozens of people on the ship, I had to resort to a guide to identify at least four of them and I felt frustrated from how the game was stretching regarding their identifiable clues. Still, being able to get through approximately 70% of the game before getting slowed down by the trickier victims shows that the game’s challenge curve is quite generous - If you know for what and where to look. I was genuinely excited whenever my newest guess would result in fanfare and correct confirmation without fail each and every time.\n\nGoing blind into Return of the Obra Dinn, I had little to no idea what I was getting into, especially not a nautical investigation with more than the dangers of mutiny going on. My biggest issue past my slight ire with the late game is with how disappointingly limp of a note the game ends on. One chapter in the log book remains locked until every other possible person is accounted for, and this last chapter only confirms what you might’ve already assumed happened that led to the later climax. As mentioned earlier, it got its hooks into me since during my breaks between playing, I was still thinking about theories and potential guesses for what happened to some of those sailors. Return of the Obra Dinn gets a big recommendation from me if you’re looking for a game that’s slower paced or will stoke the interest of the detective in all of us... Just bear in mind that there’s backtracking out the neck if your patience is rattled by that.",

      "It's strange how this will be the first review I ever write for a game. I always thought it would be written for a game like Fallout, Elderscrolls or some huge open world survival horror. And yet it's this little piece of art that has me aching to write something, if only for a minute.\nWhen I had finished this, a few minutes ago, I couldn't believe that they only charge a pittence for it. I thought to myself that if people can charge you 70 euro for games that are poorly executed and badly made from start to finish, then this game should have a much higher pricetag. It wasn't before looking up and seeing that I just finished the first episode in a mere three hours that I understood their reasoning. I feel, however, obliged to tell you all that the three hours spent in this game were worth more to me than the hundreads of hours I've spent in most other games combined. Not because the story was awsome, or the graphics made me gape in awe, but rather that every single aspect of the game in combination managed to grip me and pull me in so that time became temporarily meaningless. Imagine if games held this standard. Imagine if your favorite action, your favorite adventure game or even your favorite driver had this kind of execution. \nYou can tell a good story in a bad way, and you can tell a bad story in a good way. The story in this game might not be the most interesting story you've ever heard, but it's good, and in the execution of it you are drawn in, captured by it, moved by it.\n\nMost adventure games will entertain, they'll give you some ups and downs along the way, but ultimately they will feel like games.\nI've never felt so fulfilled after \"playing a game\" as I did today.

      "Imagine releasing an \"update\" that breaks peoples games/ mods, JUST SO YOU CAN PUT A BANNER AD IN THE MENU FOR BL3. Just WOW.",
      "I definitely would not recommend this. The aesthetic of it might appeal to some people, which is what initially drew me in, but the visual awe wears off after seeing the same scene too many times. The game is best played with paper and pencil in hand so that you waste as little time as possible wandering around in a straight line. \n\nThis game survives off of the mysterious nature of its content in the sense that if people knew how small the experience was, they would not buy it. I was thoroughly let down by this game, especially since its promotional material hyped me up for an exploration game with a unique method of interacting with the world. \n\nThe main feature that sets the game apart from other titles, the use of the telephone to access parts of the static world, becomes little more than a password screen used to pick up where you left off or were booted out of your game by a short time limit. After the first two or three times I used the game's core feature, I was tired of it and wished there was a way to play the game that was faster or had more depth.\n\nFor anyone who has played or seen any amount of gameplay from Yume Nikki, you will realise that this game's design begs the audience to compare the two. However, the most useful comparison to draw between the two is by using the game that Madotsuki can play in her room as an example. In Madotsuki's game, \"Nasu,\" is a joyless game about catching fruit. It is repetitive, intentionally annoying, has no bearing on your progression/success, and is meant to urge you toward doing something else. Unfortunately, this is a suitable comparison, as it succeeded in making me feel like Madotsuki in real life and I want to turn off the game and do almost anything else in record time.\n\nI truly wanted to like this game, but I cannot justify spending $5 for this experience when I played better flash games all the way back in middle school for free.",
      "One of the best platformer/Beat-them-up just got upgraded. new attacks, new enemies, new bosses, new levels, new modes, new skins and a graphical improvement, this is really worth getting if you didn't play the original version. if you have the original you get a 66% discount which is good but i still think it should be an optional DLC that sells for 2 Dollars. of course i understand many people won't buy it because they played the original and they shouldn't buy it, but as for me its just that i wanted a reason to replay Guacamelee again so i bought this.",
      "An okay game that wastes your time.\n\n\nI played on the hardest difficulty. For me there was a pretty big difficulty spike somewhere in chapter 6 or 7. Apparently I had been skipping on the battles earlier on and was a bit too low level. No problem, I had just unlocked skill trees for the characters, so some XP spending made things manageable. I had to try the map a few times, but once I downed a few mobs and gained some levels, all was going well. The objective was to kill all the enemies by certain time, and that's what I aimed to do. Except, once I'd killed all the enemies, the objective changed and I would've needed to trudge to the other side of the map and kill the boss as well. Yeah, fuck that.\n\n\nThe combat works round-by-round in speed order. If your characters go faster than the enemies, you can simply spam AoE attacks and kill droves of them before they go. If enemies are faster, you're kind of screwed because they hit hard, you're on the defensive, have to spend turns healing and cannot attack that much. And levels seem to make a huge difference here. Combat seems sort of poorly balanced in this respect; maps are hard at the beginning, but by the end just a joke because you gained a few points of speed and are now overall faster and can spam AoE attack and kill enemies in droves.\n\nThe user interface and usability is pretty archaic. For example, to get out of a menu you have to explicitly click on the button that says \"back\" instead of just clicking a right mouse button or Esc or whatever.\n\nThe writing was quite funny at times. It also seemed of a mixed quality. A lot of times it seemed clearly aimed at 13-year olds.  (Especially cringey are the first pair of \"combat helpers\" you get.) I also did play the game for a lot longer at once than I usually do. I think there's some kind of magical simplicity about it, and it's fun to play.\n\nIt's just, in general, the one thing I dislike the most is doing again the exact same thing that I just did. That's the developers' way of saying \"fuck you\" to me, and so I don't want to play this game anymore. If you don't mind that, and the game looks like something you'd like, then I don't doubt you'll like it. Don't get it for 20 moneys though. 15, perhaps... 10 yeah, sure. Because reading the reviews, the one thing many agree on is the later you get the more garbage the combat gets. So, in essence, you only have the visual novel aspect. And if you're not 13 anymore, I don't know. Play something else perhaps.",

      "I was reluctant to buy this because 2020 should be out in a few months but I couldn't pass up the deal I got. I am having a blast with this game! The presentation is wonderful, sense of speed is some of the best I've experienced, and the AI seems very human like so far. I was a little worried about the RPG elements and leveling up because I'm not really into stuff like that but it really isn't that much to worry about and I'm glad I got over myself. I've completed 2 weekends so far with default assists on and I'm currently 10 points behind 1st in the standings. I think it's time to take assists off. Oh I'm using a PS4 controller, by the way. I'll be happy to answer questions if you have any.\n\n***Update because it's super cheap with 2020 coming out soon. I still stand behind my OG review. Early reviews of 2020 indicates that there may be more realistic physics but could still use improvement. I say either get 19 now or wait for 20 to get discounted in a few months. No series is worth $60+ every single year.",
      "It's hard to recommend Spelunky 2. Not because it is a bad game, but because it can be frustrating. As with most roguelikes, dying means going back to the beginning. In Spelunky however, nothing carries over to future runs. All you get to bring in to your next run is your own experience and knowledge; And when half the things in the game kill you instantly or stunlock you to death, having a great run end in a quick death can be damaging to one's will.\n\nThankfully, your own experiences count a great deal towards your progress. Most hazards and enemies in Spelunky 2 have a very simple and predictable behaviour. But keeping track of everything on the screen is still a challenge. Enemies and traps will also work together (or against each other) and still bring your demise somehow. Either by bumping your helplessly stunned body into other enemies and traps, or enemies having their own flaming corpse launched towards you and your flammable jetpack. It's actually quite funny sometimes. A good deal of entertainment can be had recording your own amazingly nonsensical deaths.\n\nSpelunky 2 improves upon Spelunky HD's gameplay by adding split paths, which allow for more variety and decision-making in your runs while staying true to the feeling and style of previous entries. It also adds a back layer to each level, allowing for more secrets to be kept. After successfully completing your first run, you can try to discover these secrets and find hidden bosses and areas and even different endings!\n\nAnyway, you might enjoy the game if you're a masochist or something.",
      "You, yes you, the person that is reading the reviews.\nI envy you because i can't play this game again for the first time.\n\nScroll back up, buy the game, get a drink and take a seat.\n\nEnjoy you waifus, music, sex stories, and reflection on your own life at 2am moments.\nDon't mind the alpacas.\n",
      "Overall, as a single player game Wargroove 2 is a tremendous improvement over the first game. The campaign is well designed and engaging, the writing is much improved and overall the gameplay is fun. The new roguelike conquest mode is a much more entertaining side thing than the godawful Arcade in 1, as well.\n\nAs a primary single player game, I hated Wargroove 1, and I can say that 2 has turned my opinion around - this game is fun, I finished the campaign and craved more, which is all you can really say! The only thing I really missed from 1 was the Puzzle mode, but maybe it'll show up in a future update? Who knows.\n\nThe major downsides is that the user interface is still the same terrible user interface that WG1 had without significant improvements, and the AI is still absolutely atrocious so playing even Vs maps against the AI is going to be pretty dull, but that hasn't changed from the first game. The soundtrack is not quite as catchy either.\n\nBut unlike WG1, I enjoyed my time with WG2 in spite of these shortcomings, and if you ever have a choice between the two, skip WG1 and just go straight into WG2.",

Rowling, at a time far before Harry & friends were even born. You’ll play as a fifth year student in the titular magics academy, admitted this late because of unspecified ‘special circumstances’. The virtual rendition of Rowling’s works is nothing short of exceptional, with not only Hogwarts itself, but also its environs (like the town of Hogsmeade or the dangerous Forbidden Forest), all recreated faithfully and down to the most minute details. Of course, some things will differ from movies and books, with the game being set in the 1800s. \n\nThe main story follows the classic ‘manifest destiny’ archetype, where your custom-made character will discover hidden potential that ties them to a greater purpose. Despite some genuinely memorable characters and some interesting side- and main-quests, the overall narrative can’t help but fall a little flat and stale, especially towards the ending phases. Nonetheless, many enjoyable adventures await you. Notably, there are no romance or love/hate dichotomies in the relationships you have with side-characters, as your choices will always end up in pretty much the same results during questlines.\n\n[h3]Exploration, Collectibles & Secrets[/h3]\nThe world is vast and visually magnificent, peppered to no-end with points of interest that often hold collectibles, currency or other utilities. Initially on foot, and later on with the iconic enchanted brooms and even flying magical creatures, you’ll be able to explore at leisure and clear the enormous amount of side-activities. A good portion of these, however, will prove inaccessible until you gain the right spells or abilities, in a sort-of ‘metroidvania’ fashion that promotes meaningful backtracking. Fast travel and an item-highlighting spell prove invaluable in saving time while exploring. Collectibles are mostly cosmetic, enabling the customization of both your wizard and your own private room once you unlock it, to suit various styles. \n\nMost dungeons and locations have additional puzzles or hidden paths that often lead to collectibles or extra resources; exploration feels rewarding, with a genuine sense of mystery surrounding each new point of interest you’ll find. Despite that, most dungeons and locations play out in the same way, and become repetitive in the long haul.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2933385898\n\n[h3]Combat System & Bosses[/h3]\nMagical battles use spells as sole means of offense and defense. Usually against multiple enemies at once, sometimes supported by allied NPCs, you’ll have to time your protection spell right in order to deflect incoming attacks, or dodge-roll away in case of unblockable ones. Enemies are varied and range from magical creatures to dark wizards and goblin soldiers, to name a few. Some of them may be weak to specific charms, others have shields you can break by using specific spell categories (damage, utility, movement) or other special abilities, like immunity to certain effects. \n\nCombat feels engaging, well-paced and is more than a little gory for this universe’s standards, death will be far more common than in the movies or books. The way you can combine spell effects to your advantage and use the environment further adds to the base system, while the amount of passive upgrades with item traits and spell-related talents you can gain progressively add another layer of depth. In late-game however you’ll become overpowered between potions, passive traits, talents and endgame spells - so much that supposedly fearsome dark wizards will prove little more than a nuisance due to power creep.\n\n[h3]Quests, Minigames & Challenges[/h3]\nQuests usually involve retrieving something, talking to a specific NPC, solving a treasure hunt based on visual clues, getting the solution to logic-based puzzles and more, depending on the case. While some side-quests are unique and memorable, most will be fetch chores or dry open-world shenanigans that you’ll have to repeat over and over in the same fashion. Less, but more meaningful and unique quests would have been better than this bloat, for sure. \n\nChallenges are paramount in unlocking unique bonuses like increased inventory capacity, many cosmetics, and even unique passive upgrades to equip in gear pieces. They often require you to slay X of a specific enemy, finish X of the same activity, and such “long-term” goals. Some of them are a massive grind and will only give you the 25th pair of gloves you don’t need, or other cosmetics that aren’t worth the effort.",
      "One word to describe this game: cheap\n-cheap level design\n-cheap story\n-cheap hit boxes\n-cheap enemy placement(''just make them fight 6 enemies at one'')\n-cheap enviroments (The Grand Drangleic Castle, f*ckers could't even model the bridge to go all the way down so you can clearly see it floating)\n-cheap boss fight (''what is Dark Souls knows for?'' ''It's hard?'' ''I heard that too, how can we make this boss harder?'' ''I dunno add another exact one for this one, 6 more for this one, have a lot of poison in the arena for this one'')\n\nJust don't, get 1 or 3 instead of this.",
      "Delete the intro.\n\nHonest Edit:\n\n Actually pretty sweet game.  Lots of things I don't like in terms of menu navigation and difficulty curve, but conceptually one of the better games I've played in awhile.  I just wish the controls weren't so poor. Very tedious with doubletap movement to dodge/counter (keyboard)\n\nAlso not very optimized for steam link or the steam controller. In general the worst parts of this game are directly attributed to the fact that this is a port. One of the worst port jobs i've seen to be honest.  Definitely play with a good controller. \n\nThe game also does a poor job of introducing the \"extended\" story, I nearly missed what i would consider the best part of the game just because I stopped after the first round of credits. There is actually a ton more content afterwards. Very worth investing the time into watching everything play out.",
      "[b]Note: This review won't be about the game or the story itself really- it's the same trilogy we fell in love with. Rather, this review is to primarily focus on the changes between the original games and the Legendary Edition.[/b]\n\n[h1][u]Graphics:[/u][/h1]\nThe most obvious changes are the graphics, and wow does it stand out. In all three games, especially in Mass Effect 3 did it look very polished, detailed, and rendered beautifully. The lighting as well as the scenery stood out, more visually than before and the special effects as well as the atmosphere ... all in 4k. Characters also look polished and not as ugly anymore, though the models in Mass Effect 1 definitely aren't going to look as good as those in ME 2 & 3.\n\n[h1][u]Photo Mode:[/u][/h1]\nSurprisingly something we didn't ask for, but was much needed. Now it's very easy to pause the game whenever (even during combat) and just zoom in, rotate the camera, change filters, adjust the brightness or blur out the background to make the characters focused, ect. The amount of screenshots and pictures I took is insane, and a very welcome edition to this game. Trust me, go to Discord or Reddit devoted to Mass Effect, and the amount of pictures is staggering.\n\n[h1][u]Controller Support:[/u][/h1]\nUnlike the previous games on PC, they did not come with Controller Support. You would of had to install a program online or do specific steps in getting it to work with your controller, and even then it was a pain. Now you can just use an Xbox One controller or a PC controller without issue. As someone who grew up playing on console, this was a must have for me to enjoy the game more.\n\n[h1][u]Changes:[/u][/h1]\nWhile I didn't think they would do it, a number of things (appearances, design, events, ect) have been changed. I came across a few things they changed for the better, and one in particular is a spoiler in ME 3, but it was so good to see them change (involves Tali). The biggest changes are likely in ME 1, with environment changes and how the layout looks, along with the fact combat is more smooth and balanced in ME 1 now. In ME 2 & 3, it's unchanged for the most part, but the interface as well as quality of life improvements are there.\n\n[h1][u]Problems:[/u][/h1]\nI won't lie, despite I loved playing Legendary Edition, there was numerous problems I came across. One major issue stemmed from collision. In ME 1, 2, and 3, sometimes Shepard will find himself going over terrain or passing over into a wall, only to get stuck and nothing will fix that unless you restart a save or the mission itself. Another issue is the flare being incredibly bright at times, even toning it down to it's lowest, the flare and 'shine' of things can be blinding. Sometimes lip syncing is a bit off (ME 1 and ME 3 had a few instances of this) and followers not popping in at times. There is also no multiplayer which was a massive let down. I loved the multiplayer in ME 3, being able to play any race was so incredible and the wave of enemies per round was exciting to survive in with my friends. I wish they included it.\n\nMy biggest issue with all 3 games was the AI. At times, the enemy AI can be dumb to auto bot levels depending on the circumstances. I played on Insanity and ME 2 had every enemy become an auto bot, always aiming for me in a split second with 100% perfect accuracy and never aiming for anyone else, even walking PAST my allies to shoot me. Then you have my AI squadmates being very broken or dumb, depending on again, the circumstances. In ME 1, they were so useless it was painful. In ME 2, they were alright but had some dumb moments. In ME 3, they could carry me and I would look at my phone as they did all the work (if you build them right). Balance and AI are a big problem in Legendary, and I hope they improve AI for everyone's sanity.\n\n[h1][u]Worth It?[/u][/h1]\nTruth be told, if you want to relive the trilogy and have an excuse, I say go for it. The price is reasonable despite a lot of people want the game cheaper or free if they own the original games already. But if you think about it, all 3 games ($20 each) plus every DLC released are free in Legendary Edition. But apart from that, despite I did very much enjoy playing this trilogy all over again, the changes aren't that big in scope. Mostly just better graphics, better framerate, adjustments in combat and adding a few changes to scenes / design of things. If you're a huge fan like me and don't mind, then yea it is worth. But if you aren't that impressed with the perks of Legendary Edition, you aren't missing out on too much. Legendary Edition is like the old trilogy but in nicer paint, polished, and got some upgrades. But even with that said, this was such a treat and I enjoyed every moment, even with the stacked cons. Amazing series overall, a must have whether it's the older games or Legendary Edition.",
      "I have a serious love/hate relationship with Sea of Thieves. It is both one of the best games I have ever played and one of the most frustrating games I have ever played, all wrapped into one. The gameplay of Sea of Thieves is INCREDIBLE. The sailing is the best in any game I have ever played. The feeling of exploration and discovery as you blast through treasure hunts and puzzles and mysteries is unlike any feeling you can get from any other game. The cooking mechanic, the healing from food, the not-terrible fishing mechanic... all subsystems that prop up the rest of the gameplay are unique and interesting in their own right. The land-based combat is relatively uninspired, yet still satisfying when part of the greater picture that the game presents. Some of my favorite memories in gaming, full stop, come from completing long nights on the high seas or doing long-form content available in the game. The game is gorgeous, some of the best ocean/water graphics in any game. The rest of the game is equally beautiful while perfectly conveying the environment of the map you are in. I swear to Gaben that I can freaking smell the wet sand or sulfurous lava on some of these islands. The music and sound design are some of the best in the industry. Outright, the game is incredible. \n\nBUT... Sea of Thieves sweaties ruin the game for me. There is absolutely nothing worse than having a night full of fun absolutely destroyed by some player who's enjoyment of the game is derived from eliminating anyone else's fun. I understand that PvP is part of the \"pirate life\", but it is by far the worst part of the game by far. I would be willing to pay money, hell a freaking monthly subscription, for the opportunity to play SoT as a strictly PvE game with just my friends and the rest of the server populated by bots. I actively avoid playing the game now because of how many of my last play sessions started with me spawning at an outpost and subsequently being sunk less than 15 feet off the dock by some sweaty that hasn't seen sunlight since the Obama administration. I know that this is an incredibly unpopular opinion in the greater SoT-sphere, but part of the enjoyment of games is letting players enjoy them how they wish, and I really freaking wish that I could enjoy the aspects of SoT that are fun to me without being the plaything of those pirates who live only to ruin the fun of others.",
      "Developers should be proud of themselves for this awful game.\nAfter a 3 hour session with a friend, my legs are stiff, my heart is confused with constant beating and my brain is extremely satisfied and wants more.\n\nIf you like being scared and the horror genre, just find a like-minded friend and play it. Even when you are simply running in and out, it's going be a lot of fun. I have no idea how one would play a medium map but maybe with 4 people one might have the courage to walk inside that cursed high school more than we did - which was 2 meters into the entrance. We didn't have the heart for more.\n\nOn a serious note: It is worth the price, hands down.\n\nPS: Devs, I hate you for how good this game is.\n\nEdit: I'm back after about two weeks and 50~ more hours. I've played at least a couple of rounds every single day and I still love the game.\n\nMy suggestion is to find a friend who'd enjoy this, get the game both and play. DON'T READ ABOUT IT! Just play for a while, enjoy screwing up, getting spooked, killed, whatever happens! The more you learn about the mechanics, the more you lose the fear, so don't read about it!\nI mean I'm still a coward at level 60 something but that's me. Of course if you are like me, then why are you reading this and not buying the game?\n\nFinal word: Check their discord to find like-minded people in the LFG! You won't be alone, I promise!",
      "A simple but detailed explanation of why, after having played both versions, I prefer Definitive Edition (DE) instead of 2013 Edition:\n\n-2013 Edition's farms don't automatically re-seed, forcing you to either order your villagers to re-seed them, or to mash the \"queue re-seed\" button in the mill. In DE, you can set the mills to automatically re-seed.\n-Definitive Edition lets you shift-click construction orders just like in 2013 Edition, but in the latter, the villager will move to build the last building you placed down. If you order several buildings, they will stop constructing the building they're already working on to go build the new one. In DE they will wait to finish the first building before starting on the next one.\n-2013 Edition's unit sprites are very pixelly and hard to distinguish one type of infantry unit from another, and to a lesser extent, one team from another. DE's graphics are much clearer so it is very easy to distinguish unit type/team.\n-Definitive Edition is far, FAR more customizable than 2013 Edition. Not just with the settings (graphics, UI, and controls are much more changeable) but especially with creating a game, namely win conditions, starting conditions, map sizes, unit restrictions, etc. You can adjust many more settings to make a new game into whatever kind of scenario you want. Also you can see what the map types actually look like in DE.\n-Definitive Edition has noticeably better pathfinding than 2013 Edition.\n-In DE you can zoom in and out. In 2013 Edition you can't.\n-In DE you can queue build orders while simultaneously upgrading the building. In 2013 Edition you can't even see any build options while a building is in the middle of upgrading.\n-In DE you can tell scouts to automatically scout out the map.\n-In DE the HUD shows you how many villagers are working on each resource. 2013 Edition does not do this, you have to play hide and seek with each one to count them.\n-The soundtrack for DE has more faction-specific songs, as well as less repetitive music. Both game's soundtracks are good, but I find having the DE soundtrack playing in the background to be more enjoyable. This point is pure preference.\n-2013 Edition's graphics are nice if you enjoy the old-school style, but DE's graphics are significantly easier on the eyes and prettier.\n-Definitive Edition has more civilizations.\n-Definitive Edition is just as moddable and has a very passionate modding community.\n-Definitive Edition seems to have more balanced gameplay.",
      "The British Forces give the Allies a bit of the German defensive capacities. It has the problem of adding too many buildings to a game that is, in its core, dynamic and based on movement and aggressiveness instead of turtling. The British units are diverse and interesting, bringing much to the table. \n\nThe DLC lacks a proper campaign for the Brits, unfortunately, even though Caen, Goodwood, Arnhem and Walcheren could have been done in some interesting missions. But, for a game focused on multiplayer, the Tommies are obligatory in everybody's library.",
      "It is a very good game, some people complain about how there are no checkpoints in levels, but fear not, as they can all be beaten in a couple of minutes, and some people complain about how its repetitive because you need to do everything over and over if you keep dying, but if that happens, its clear you are missing something, so by heading to the IEYTD website, you can see tips for every level (secrets are not included, only how to beat the level itself), and if the tips dont help, after 2 tips you can just choose to reveal the answer, so those negative reviews are no reason to not buy this amazing game, this is the game trilogy i recommend every VR player to play ATLEAST once",
      "Where's the atmosphere the first two games had?\nWhy can I only have 2 weapons at any time?\nWhy is this game a generic shooter?\nIf the game they had shown in so many videos previous to the release had come out, it'd have been a masterpiece, instead we got a severely watered down version of it.\nIt's a corridor shooter for the most part, with some parts where you're in a bigger room instead, really what I played the first two games for.",
      "I'll preface this by admitting that it makes sense for so many of the \"helpful\" reviews to be negative; it's good to warn customers of a game they won't enjoy, and The Witness definitely isn't for everybody.  That said, this is among my favorite games, and I was looking forward to The Witness for a very long time, so the fact that it lived up to my expectations says a lot.\n\n(You may find it helpful to know my preferences, so here are some of my other favorites: Fez, Portal, Infinifactory, LIMBO, The Beginner's Guide, and of course, Braid.)\n\nAs other reviewers have pointed out, The Witness isn't \"fun\"; that's not a criticism, it's just an accurate observation.  The Witness is treading unfamiliar territory, but only for a video game: most other artistic mediums have been used to explore themes other than \"fun,\" and it makes sense that this medium can be used similarly.\n\nInsofar as objective criteria exist for judging the quality of a video game, The Witness meets every standard I can think of: the game runs smoothly, the team have been timely about patching bugs, the visuals (gorgeous and stylized) and audio (understated and lacking music) are expertly executed, and the design of the world and puzzles is meticulous (and ambitious).\n\nThe only objective drawbacks I can think of are:\n\n1) The absence of an FOV slider (important for those who suffer from motion-sickness), which the developers have hinted may be added in a future update. UPDATE: this has been added, along with some other configuration options.\n\n2) Some of the puzzles are impossible to solve if you're deaf or color-blind.\n\nFrom what I can tell, The Witness is about making your own observations and forming your own theories about how the game mechanics work (the title of the game is relevant to its content); it's partly about solving puzzles, but more so it's about figuring out what the puzzles even are and how they work in the first place; given that, it's easy to see why The Witness fails to provide players with a clear goal or feedback: that would undermine the core of the game.  Patient curiosity is the best mindset with which to approach The Witness; it's like a piece of cloth with a loose thread: you pull it, and it keeps unraveling, and unraveling, and unraveling...\n\nThe intrigue of The Witness stems from constant and subtle revelations about how the game functions, which tend to overturn your previous theories and force you to let go of your presumptions, all without ever jumping the shark.\n\nThe Witness is slow to get rolling, patiently waiting while you adjust yourself to the mechanics and freely allowing you hold on to your false sense of comprehension.  You might expect a game like this to be eager to shove its paradigm-shifting revelations in your face, but it generally isn't: The Witness makes no effort to divulge its secrets, and when you peel back another layer, you can take comfort in the fact that it's a real accomplishment on your part.\n\nThe island is dense with puzzles (more so than it appears at first), and each of the nearly 700 puzzles (according to the developers) presents its own unique challenge, and a peek into the mechanics of the game (if you're paying attention).  The puzzles are each short, but satisfying and interconnected, so it's easy to leave the game at any time, and they're grouped into areas, where each area explores a particular game mechanic.\n\nBecause you're free to wander the island, you can walk away from one area if you get stuck and try a different one.  I usually had two or three areas I could choose between at any time.  If you try to play through each area, beginning to end, one at a time, I imagine you'll not enjoy yourself very much.  Once you get stuck on a puzzle, rather than continue banging your head against it, I recommend venturing off to find a different one; returning to a puzzle with a fresh palette and new mechanics under your belt may shake something loose.  The puzzles generally shouldn't require guesswork, and all of them are fair.\n\nThere's no narrative in The Witness.  You'll find recordings scattered around the island, which contain quotes from people throughout history, generally on the topics of awareness, discovery, investigation, and the monotheistic concept of a god.\n\nBeing an atheist, some of these fell flat for me, while others less concerned with theism hit hard, and one even had me teary-eyed.  Each one rang with the sort of sincerity that will either move you, or make you very uncomfortable, depending on how it plays against your own life and beliefs.\n\nIf I'm to be honest, I think The Witness has affected me on a personal level: its themes of exploration and discovery, and its quiet faith in your capacity to unravel its mysteries are comforting.  If you're in the mood for some introspection, you'll probably enjoy it as I have.",
      "You know that feeling when you are hesitant to buy a game because you're worried you might waste your money on something that might be a crap game in the end, get boring, and not sure if you should believe all the ratings because you dont know if everyone has the same interests and likes as you? well this game is the bomb diggity, straight up. Made by the same people who made rollercoaster tycoon and man did they deliver on this. For me it's the small things in a game that matter and did they really take the time to make sure this was as polished as it could be. Not sure if anyone remembers when they announced another rollercoaster tycoon a while back, and everyone was super excyited to find out what it was, and it ended up being some dumbass phone app? Well imagine all that excyitment, but instead of them coming out with that stupid app they came out with this bad boy. This is exactly what everyone was wishing and hoping for (just different name). Do I reccomend you buy this game? hell yes. will it be exactly what you are wishing for when you fist clicked this game to see the game play and reviews? sure as cocks will. But will it be just as fun as the original?.... YOU BET YOUR MOMS TITS IT WILL BE. \n\nPROS:                                \nbeen one since 1990\n\nCons:\nYou'll never know how fun it is till you buy it.",

Maybe it's just me but I cannot recommend this if you loved the original. Maybe newcomers will like it.\n\nEdit after 18 more hours: the original is still better but this remake is not bad. I can recommend it.",
      "Okay this is a weird situation. I personally don't like this game all that much, but I do still recommend it nonetheless. That's because despite me not being personally huge on it, I can't deny that it is a very well-crafted game that definitely will give people the experience they want if this is the type of game they're looking for. I, turns out, am not part of the crowd that is targeted for said experience. I just found the whole trial and error stealth RTS style of this game to just not be my cup of tea, but again I can't deny its very well-crafted. I also think the art style and voice acting and story are all very well done as well. So yeah, if you're fond of games of this type, then go for it. I'm sure you won't be disappointed. I, for one, don't think I'm entirely sold on it though.",

What was originally a game of heartbreak and painful memories, I had managed to find it someone new to play with. While this game had terrible memories, I had decided that a game such as this was undeserving of them, and thus created new memories with another special person in my life.\n\nThe game is remarkable, with good writing, and amazing gameplay, and it is deserving of the buy. Each level is crafted with amazing detail, and all of the mini-games are just as fun as the main game itself. Don't let bad memories keep you down, and instead create happier ones. Live your life, ya'll.",
      "This game looks incredible and I'm really enjoying the story so far. It does have some bugs still, but nothing I've come across has particularly bothered me, much less ruined the game. It's incredibly immersive and detailed, the voice acting is really good, and the gameplay is fun.",
      "I've been waiting since the likes of Planescape Torment and Baldurs Gate 2 for a game to match their sheer perfection, many games came quite close, but Divinity Original Sin just manages to hit so many nails on the head its not funny.

The voice acting is spot on and it has the most sublime OST.\n\nThe combat is turn-based but do not let this put you off, there are so many choices in combat with the interaction of spells with each other and the environment, that the game just begs you to experiment with different tactics.\n\nThis game just oozes pure class, it was a labour of love for Larian and it shows in every tiny detail of the game.\nIf you like RPG games (or even just pure quality games), you need to play this game, it is the benchmark I will use in comparing other games in future.\n\nWell done Larian.",
      "5/10 Too difficult to be any fun playing the game on normal. got at least 10 more hours offline\n+ they put in cheats to make the game actually playable. turned them on after finishing the 2nd world\ni went with 2 dashes and dash assist after all those wrong way dashes.....\n- people who cheat get the same achievements as people who dont, so whats the point???\n- no steam workshop, people could make fun levels unlike the entire game.....\n- one of those dumb meta storys\n- dashes got me killed all the time, janky. towerfall had way better dash system\n+ you can skip the storys, helps when replying levels over and over looking for that dumb B side track",
      "Really overrated. Sure the graphics are fancy schmancy, but in the end it feels more like a dumbed-down Left 4 Dead.\n\nPurely from a gameplay perspective, the class specializations are excessively numerous with not that many differences between many of them (and notably, every class can use the same weapons anyway), and the solo mode sucks (no bots, are you kidding me?).\n\nOn other aspects of the game, there is that XP and (cosmetic) items grinding that seems to be the current trend/cash cow. And the fucking ridiculous buying of weapons and ammo within missions because, you know, killing monsters gives you money and in a world completely wrecked by zombies there are automated weapon stores at every corner - seems legit. Feels like that CSGO crap: it's not an FPS as much as a trading \"game\", where you buy stuff ingame and you buy or sell stuff on the Steam marketplace.",

      "I got this game on a whim because I once played this series like... a decade ago. DW3/4 to be specific. And even though I know full well that this sort of game is basically meant for consoles, I managed to play it just fine once I adjusted the key bindings to stuff that worked well for me. Anyway... game.\n\nIf, like me, you have played these games before, you pretty much know what you are in for. If you have never played any of these games, I'm not quite sure what else is quite like it. Basically it's a fighting game, except it is on large battlefield maps where you murder thousands of random and a handful of named NPC's while following objectives in order to complete each level. If that sounds repetitive... well it can certainly be that. It's the ultimate hack and slash-fest game, and if you get bored with murdering insane numbers of enemies, then chances are this game is not for you.\n\nThe game is based upon the Three Kingdoms era of Ancient China (184-280, roughly), and, despite the absurd outfits and personalities of many of the characters in the game, it is actually fairly consistent with what is known about the period. Or rather, it is consistent with the famous novel 'Romance of the Three Kingdoms' by Luo Guanzhong, which is basically a work of historical fiction that takes real events and bends them a bit according to the whims and views of the author. Which, of course, means that certain characters (particularly Shu-Han characters like Xuande/Liu Bei) are depicted as noble honorable sorts fighting for justice while others (like Mengde/Cao Cao) are depicted as villanous and driven by ambition. I don't want to dig too deep into this because there most likely are entire books written about how Luo Guanzhong messed around with the characters, but the depictions he made are pretty much what are found in this and all previous DW games. The nice thing though is that if you read between the lines (or maybe it's just because I am very familiar with the source material this game is based off of), you can see the flaws in the author's bias in the game as well. Namely that Liu Bei was a massive hypocrite every bit as ambitious as his rivals, and that Cao Cao, while not exactly the nicest guy around, wasn't the hellspawn other characters (like Liu Bei) called him.\n\nAnyway, the game follows the story decently well, though some creative license and trimming down obviously has happened. I still liked how the game depicted things most of the time. Perhaps my favorite was Lu Bu's campaign which, while maintaining the massive \"OMG ITS LU BU\" hype that all DW games have had, reveals exactly why the real Lu Bu got himself executed in chapter 19 of a 120 chapter book: that he was dumb as a brick, betrayed people constantly, and never listened to anyone's advice. While the old DW games I played did have storylines for him, they didn't take the historical route that this game's (default) story path takes. The same goes for the numerous character deaths shown, though many of these are made more dramatic than they actually were.\n\nAlso, while the playable character cast has increased to the point of total insanity (including some that may not have even existed or actually fought on battlefields), I did like that, in the time between DW4 and this, they added a number of characters that rounded out the cast further by including some of the other lesser-known strategists (Chen Gong, Lu Su) and characters who rose to prominence in the later parts of the story (Deng Ai, the sons of Guan Yu/Zhang Fei, as well as the entire Jin faction who were the ultimate winners of this whole mess). I thought that was a nice treat since these sorts had been badly neglected in past games, where everything seemed to stop at the year 234 (when Kongming/Zhuge Liang died), which was roughly the chronological halfway point of the entire story.\n\nOk, I better stop and just finish this up.\n\nIn short, It's a DW game. That means that on the one hand, the combat gets repetitive, many of the characters are very hard to take seriously, and many of the story events are overdramatized to the point of being kind of ridiculous. On the other hand, there is a MASSIVE amount of content (and all those DLC's for this \"Complete Edition\" are purely cosmetic), big battles are kind of fun, and one can even argue that the storyline's inherent cheesiness may actually be more a positive than a negative.\n\nIf you have never played one of these games before, this is the one i'd look at because (to my knowledge) it's the newest one and has an insane amount of content even compared to its predecessors. If you have played these and liked them before... why not? If you didn't like these games however, then most likely this will do nothing to change your opinion.\n\nFor all it's goofiness and repetition, DW is still entertaining enough for me to waste sizeable amounts of time with it. Hooray and stuff.",
      "Wow. Just wow. This is BY FAR the best visual novel i have played. the old school forums and cameras feel very detailed as whenever anything happens in a video chat, no matter how small, the characters react to it. the story was very enthralling and every time i slipped up and made a wrong move, my heart would feel as though it was gonna beat out of my chest. talking to violet felt very real and made the ending that i got so much more satisfying. the only bad things i can even say about this absolute masterpiece is just the fact that most of the really impact full options were locked because \"Emmett isn't cocky enough\" or  \"Emmett isn't compassionate enough\" which felt very vague and confining.\n\noverall the game is absolutely amazing and i wish the devs would come out with a game similar to this because of how good it was.\n9/10",

      "A forward-hurtling psychedelic tube shooter with a tremendous sense of speed and odd, zen relaxation. The closest thing I have to compare it to is probably [i]Rez[/i]: if you liked that, definitely give this a whirl.\n\nConversions of arcade classics and legends are commonplace. But an arcade [i]myth?[/i] Only one springs to mind: [b]POLYBIUS[/b]. There one minute and gone the next, so they say - an enigmatic arcade cabinet installed and removed by mysterious men in black: rumours of people hooked to the screen and unable to remember or communicate what they saw afterwards, save for that it was immersive, fast, colourful, and strangely hypnotic. A fly-by-night company that went out of business? A government mind control experiment? Probably not, no. A hoax. An urban legend. A myth.\n\nBut a myth was all Jeff Minter needed. If you're previously unfamiliar with Jeff Minter and his stable Llamasoft, he's been creating weird arcade-inspired games and \"lightsynths\" (as in, the inspiration for Milkdrop and other music visualisers) out of a barn in Wales since the 1980s. His creations are marked by being fast, psychedelic, and strangely sheep-themed, generally in search of the kind of gameplay that invites the player to get \"in the zone\". And so it is here.\n\nIn search of a new original creation, he turned his mind to the arcade legend Polybius as inspiration, and his interpretation is oddly faithful:[list]\n[*]Immersive: it supports VR if you have it, wrapping you into the game world - it draws you into the screen even if you don't.\n[*]Fast: capable of and designed for very high-refresh rates if you can support them.\n[*]Colourful: look at the screenshots, you get the idea.\n[*]Hypnotic: hurtling forwards shooting abstract things in tunnel patterns seems like it would be intense, and it is, but - [i]Relax. Just look at the centre of the screen as you move forward. Go through the horns. Let it take you[/i].[/list]\n\nOnce you get the hang of it and start relaxing into it and getting into that sense of flow, it's curiously calming. I can see myself bringing this out for a quick session after a stressful day: it's particularly good to dip into. Long sessions might result in seeing patterns on the walls, Tetris-style.\n\nIt's not for everyone: Minter's games never have been. In particular, you may wish to skip this one if you have sensory conditions that make you susceptible to motion sickness, or photosensitive epilepsy.\n\nGood music too, and doesn't need high specs either.

      "Should you buy this game? So glad you asked. Yes!\n\nShould this be your very first JRPG? Yes, [i]but...[/i] read on.\n\n*\n\nMy recent gamplay was a 90+hr adventure (some offline) that was well worth the discounted price (-50% = 8€). The game's positive reviews are well-deserved, but tell little of actual gameplay to someone who might be interested in this kind of RPG, but never did play a JRPG/SRPG. \n\nThis was may be your case, too, so here's what I learned... \n\n***** [b] World of Zemuria[/b]: thoughtful, detailed, infinitely rich. (5/5)\n\nFor this installment in the popular franchise we get to adventure in Kingdom of Liberl, discovering a wide-reaching plot and tackling some mysteries. Cliché much?\n\nThis game does not shy away from the overused concepts, but delivers them with fresh spins, and gives them some unexpectedly serious reasoning. Talking to various NPC's, including random household members, paints the game's stage a somber shade of grey - with much emphasis on recently fought war and new orbment technologies available. (You'll be amazed at how many NPCs stress over a family member unable to get or hold a job.) As you march on, you'll learn that beneath all the apparent sweetness lies a serious, compelling narrative. Its logic includes economy, psychology and strategy and favours realism + logic to drive and resolve many conflicts. The overwhelming cuteness and apparent anime-aesthetics serve as a visual counter-point and a fun diversion for the consumer - as ever.\n\nXSEED did a wonderful job on translating and adapting the game. [url=xseedgames.tumblr.com/post/92769039590/xseed-blog-the-legend-of-heroes-trails-in-the]With the problems they faced[/url] and work ahead of them, this needs to be stressed.\n\n[i]Warning for the easily offendable:[/i] This RPG follows the tradition of amalgamating many diverse cultural and historical influences in a distinct blend of East & West. When the Gospel and an Apostle make an appearance, they singify something else from what one might expect. Also, while loved and cared for, children of Liberl do get exposed to real danger. That orphanage you helped? Burnt to the ground. The grand-daughter wanting to help her grandpa? Gets sternly warned, but ultimately joins for an incredibly dangerous infiltration mission to rescue him.\n\n***** [b]Playable characters[/b]: varied, with very flexible builds, require some system mastery. (5/5)\n\nYou get to make a party of up to 4 PCs and as the story goes on, more people join the Bright kids. The Bracer Guild they're a part of provides them with much quest fodder and some plot protection, but ultimately, they're on their own. Their companions are darn well excellent and come in very handy: if you can't fight through an area, wait until your ranks well. Of the 6 available, Schera's and Oliverier's antics made me giggle ever so often, and they are my favourites. In lieu of an old favourite of mine, imagine a game where most of in-game banter has Sands pitted against Neeshkas... You'll love it.\n\nSo what's with the builds? They are limited, but not in a bad way. The character level-ups are automated, abilities are unlocked intermittently and vary greatly (each character has a different build, but no class). You get a pick of 5 equippable items + some slots to fill wil crystals which are more than wondrous items, because they synergize. You may play around for a bit and just pick anything to wear/slot, because there's always a reload/retry or flight from a battle... I've actually made it halfway through the game before I read up on those orbal crystals and made my first optimized builds. \n\nAll in all, the character building is very beginner-friendly, which helps a lot. And there's ample room for experiment, which is great. Strategic value of turn-based combat is best described elsewhere, but let's just say it doesn't disappoint.\n\n[i]Warning for the lazy:[/i] The characters need to be fine-tuned, eventually. Final chapter presents a tournament which requires a higher level of orbal system mastery, while the final battle sequence ranges from enjoyable (if you got the combinations right) to downright enfuriating (if you didn't).\n\n[i]Warning for time-constrained:[/i] Beware the walls of text. Seriously. It's a living book.  It eats players.\n\n[i]Warning for the romantically inclined:[/i] There is much in-game talk about the nature of Joshua and Estelle's growing relationship, yet not one NPC seems to mind the fact that they're officially siblings (Estelle is Cassisus' daughter, and Joshua's his ward/stepson). Which is fine by me, because the two couldn't be more opposed than they are, and their confusion about life & love is delivered tactfully and with much wit. \n\n*** [b] The gameplay [/b]: a rocky ride to get through the story. (3/5)\n\nWhat I didn't miss here was a feeling of game being rushed and some content dropped because of time constraints - something my favourite Western RPGs chronically suffer from. The main narrative is one of adventure, with walls of text hinting at massive spoilers. I enjoyed it immensely, and can't wait for the sequel!\n\nWith that said, there are some glaring issues with gamplay and story presentation. The one thing I did have a problem with were wildly varying secret quests one can discover along the way (you'll need to consult a [url=www.gamefaqs.com/psp/933329-the-legend-of-heroes-trails-in-the-sky/faqs/62079?single=1]guide[/url] to get them). In-game Junior Bracer Journal served me well as an agenda, so that's a plus. \n\n[i]Warning in general:[/i] achievements such as best rank/weapon take a lot of time and effort, so be warned and grab a guide BEFORE starting the game properly. As TvTropes put it, my playthrough suffered a heavy case of Guide Dang It!\n\n[i]Warning for time-constrained:[/i]  I didn't mind all the grinding, but you can't escape it. Especially if you want the best gear the game's got or insist on micro-managing stuff. The difference between starting the Chapter 1 as L14 (my first try) and L18 (the second playthrough I finished) taught me to grind as I save: at every opportunity, as much as I can. And also, the railroading, apparently a traditional facet of the JRPG genre. Finally, hasty decisions versus small time windows. You can miss so much with only a click. I re-did the Prologue because I was merely getting to know the ropes and I missed two books I wanted to collect. The re-run was worth it.\n\n*\n\n[b]TL;DR[/b]: Very good game, with some issues for the uninitiated. Merits a sequel (localization's in the works!) and a second playthrough (especially for achievements).\n\n*\n\nThank you for reading this review. It was my first, and I hope it served you well. =)",

      "First of all, i'd like to mention that i found this game by chance. But it's surprisingly better than some RPGMaker game i've tried and it's not your typical RPGMaker which is surprising since it's developed by one person.\n\n[h2]Story/character[/h2]\nOverall the story is good enough to keep myself immersed with the game. However the story and characters aren't really memorable. For lack of better comparison, it's similar with movie which entertain you but you won't remember it for long time. Although it's probably because i've played many top-rated RPGMaker game which have more budget/resource.\n\n[h2]Gameplay[/h2]\nWhile the developer emphasize this game is story-focused game, i would also describe this game as puzzle-focused RPGMaker game. Store page mention 3 hours, but it took me 9.5 hours to beat this game. Although if i never experience bug (mentioned below) and stuck at one puzzle (where i asked help on Steam discussion), i expect i would spend 7.5 hours.\n\nThe amount and variety of puzzle presented on this game is surprisingly very diverse. Some of them are the best puzzle I've experienced even though I've played fair amount of RPGMaker game. Although few others feels repetitive, difficult due to lack of hint or force you to walk around if you miss/skip something. Lack of option to run/always run is also mildly annoying for me.\n\nAnd since the puzzle of this game is rather challenging/tricky for RPGMaker game, here are few general hints from me in case you're stuck,\n[list]\n    [*]Check for hidden/invisible wall.\n    [*]Try to use items on your inventory.\n    [*]Some interactive object have no impact to solve the puzzle.\n    [*]The game show some hint, usually by highlight/flicker certain object.\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Graphic/music[/h2]\nNothing much to say here. There's few usage of stock RPGMaker asset which used accordingly. The music is nice. While the artstyle/visual is on good side, personally i feel it doesn't match very well with space/sci-fi theme. The cutscene CG also looks good.\n\n[h2]Misc.[/h2]\nThis game runs well on Linux with only minor problem. I experienced one bug which makes me unable to continue the game (not caused by Linux, since it also happen on device which use Windows OS), but the developer fixed it after some time. The game only offer single save file which is annoying to me since i experienced a bug and few puzzle are very tricky.\n\n[h2]Conclusion[/h2]\nOverall Mihirha's Legacy is nice RPGMaker despite few hiccups I've mentioned above. The developer is also responsive to my query which is also plus point. If you're RPGMaker enthusiast, you might want to try this game.",
      "In terms of originality, this gets a zero.  It's a Robotron clone with pretty graphics.  There have been many of these, and my personal favourite is the original Mutant Storm which is sadly no longer available to buy.  However, the graphics are really really pretty, and the game play is really really good.  So for being the best implementation of the Robotron idea to date it gets a big thumbs up!\n\nSuggestions where it could be improved:\n[list]\n    [*]Graphics are so pretty they do sometimes make it hard to see what's going on.  Maybe have a less pretty looking mode.\n    [*]4 player co-op\n    [*]Online co-op\n    [*]Ability to save/pause arcade mode so you don't have to play through entire game in single session.\n[/list]",

      "Homeworld is typically known as the very first 3D RTS -- despite this distinguishing trait, it's not very popular. It's rather obscure, which I find odd for a game that was made with so much love and detail. The story of the two Homeworld campaigns is very nice, the aesthetic of the game is excellent in my opinion, but when it comes to the multiplayer, in vanilla 2.1 Homeworld, the current version, you will face severe balancing issues between the races.\nFortunately, the community has come up with a solution, one that took a lot of time and effort to be. Thanks to them, the multiplayer is now playable with the patch that they made -- the 2.3 players patch. It's still being updated and is worked on by people who understand the overall concept of the game and the genre it belongs to.\nIt's available to everyone in the workshop and is in my opinion (and a lot of others's) the best way to experience both multiplayer and the game itself.",
      "TLDR:\n\n+ good AI\n+ beautiful graphics\n+ large armies\n+ not as twitchy as StarCraft\n+ good skirmish customization\n+ viable defenses\n+ good but not exceptional SP campaign\n+ good amount of maps\n\n- beefy hardware needed\n- difficult to distinguish units\n- UI / usability not quite where SC is (yet!)\n\nYou might like it if you:\n+ like Supreme Commander\n+ prefer a slower approach to RTSes\n+ like comp stomping alone or with friends\n+ like thousands of units on the screen at the same time.\n\nYou better skip it if you:\n- like StarCraft\n- don't like the SciFi setting\n- buy the game for its narrative / SP campaign\n- have a potato for a PC to run this on.\n\nIt has been said before, but Ashes is quite the spiritual successor to Supreme Commander. The focus is more on the strategic side, rather than the hectic button mashing that is found in StarCraft-like games. Armies move quite slowly, defenses are viable and unit abilities are \"centralised\" in \"orbital\" abilities. Although the game offers a campaign mode and various scenarios, the main focus is on skirmish maps. These skimishes offer a vast amount of options to adjust the rules to your liking (like no air units, defensive bonuses etc.). You can win games by eliminating the enemies HQ or by accumulating victory points by holding special locations. I could swear the AI was adapting its army composition to counter my armies and defenses. \nThe developer is known for supporting their games for a very long time and when you take a look at their design documents, you find that there is still stuff planned in the future:\n- more tech tiers,\n- naval units,\n- overall usability improvements \nand more.\n\nOn the negative side, I find the different units and buildings quite difficult to distinguish. While most of it is due to the fact, that its grounded in science fiction (its not like in Company of Heroes, where a thing that looks like an MG nest is indeed an MG nest and behaves as you think it would), its not clear what a building does just by looking at it. But as times goes by you get used to it.\nAlthough you can queue up multiple buildings and units (even on repeatable queues), or order reinforcements directly from the selected army, the overall usability could still be improved. Its not obvious that building blueprints and waypoints can be moved for excample and the different levels of icons shown when zooming out could be better adjusted.\nIts all rather nit picky though. I am sure that Stardock will keep improving the game!",
      "I played this game because I had a very strained relationship with my mother somewhere along my teenage years and in the end it came to be that we never saw each other anymore, nor had anymore contact as well. I decided to give this game a try because I wanted to feel what was like to have that bubbly bond between a mother and son again, back when I was younger. \n\nWell, it gave those feelings back to me, and it gave it like a sucker punch to the guts. \n\nI still listen to the OST from time to time and it still reminds me of times of childhood back before when everything became so terrifying.\n\nGive your mother a hug or a call at least if you can before you can never anymore.",

      "Ratchet & Clank is always fun. The older games are clearly better, as it feels like the more modern they get, the shallower and simpler they become. They now feel almost like a demo of a game - you just get to dip your toe into each of the systems, never really fully engaging with any of them. New abilities are just thrown at you with no fanfare, and then you only need them 3 times, and it never asks you to combine them in new ways. Everything feels underwhelming and tossed aside shortly after being introduced. That's almost the theme of the game - they even have Ratchet meeting a fellow Lombax for the first time ever, the thing he has been focused on since game 1, and it's pretty much just \"hi, let's go do the next thing.\" The series has been casualized, just as neutered as their formerly innuendo-laden titles. \n\nBut it's still fun to play, it's just lacking the magic it used to have.",

That last death was cheap, I'll do one more to make up for it. I just need 1000 gold for that upgrade, I'll just do one more to get it. Always just one more. \n\nThings I like:\n\n+Strong RPG Progression - Gold from your run can be spent on stats, equipment, abilities, etc. making multiple runs and longer runs more rewarding.\n\n+The game is witty and has flavor. -- there are various conditions your new characters can have such as being blind, gay or having a fear of chickens, amongst many, many others. Dying is in this sense, pretty fun. The writing has a lot of charm!\n\n+The controls are very tight -- this game has good controls. It's easy to do what you want, which is good because it's very tough and you will die a lot.\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n- The bosses in new game plus don't get harder -- As you progress into new game + or ++ or +++ and beyond, the bosses don't scale well, despite the general enemies leveling up to basically become bosses themselves. Not a huge deal, but it's the only negative I have.\n\nThen at some point you realize you've beaten the game, Thankfully there is a new game plus.\nMaybe just one more playthrough...",
      "Disclaimer: This is review from player who prefer story-rich game and haven't played any game by Arkhouse Telegraph.\n\nThe good:\n+ Outstanding 80's-esque visual pixel artstyle. It reminds me of few SNES/Atari/Gameboy games.\n+ Fairly good soundtrack.\n+ Some cutscene/area have fascinating atmosphere.\n+ Run well with Steam proton, so it's likely this game is playable for Linux/Steam Deck user. Although the platformer area might show too many small detail for 7\" display.\n+ Game OST/artbook is available for free on Arkhouse website.\n\nThe bad:\n- While i understand nature of this game require player to find out most thing and go through trial-and-error, some parts definitely need to be explained better. I refer to lack of autosave (for most part of the game), not letting player know about manual save (you can do it by head left after exit for cylinder elevator until you see display/sign \"< S\" and suggestion to visit block H (where you get some guidance).\n- While the manual say i can play R. U. N. E. 3000 first, i have hard time understanding the story and lore/world building. Conversation such as \"DO? DORODO!\" is mostly gibberish and i only can make vague guess based on few specific term (\"V2\", \"50/50\", etc.) and area i've visited. Short recap of previous games (even it's on the manual) could be really helpful for newcomers.\n\nThe ugly:\n* I experience a bug where i fight boss i'm not supposed to fight yet. In detail, [spoiler] after i exit from P block to get symbol cracking code, i was thrown to G block where i fight G-Cat/10th boss. The worst part is the boss HP bar started with red color and auto 3-60 cannon never perform attack. Fortunately the bug doesn't occur again after i load from manual save.  [/spoiler].\n* The gameplay variation/idea is very interesting, but the execution is mixed bags (more explanation on below paragraph)\n\nSaturn Quest: R. U. N. E. 3000 has lots of gameplay variant/modes (Adventure, Shoot'em up, Platformer and many more) to keep the game fresh. While each area/boss have different reason why it's challenging/difficult, many of those is very unbalanced. For example, [spoiler] Bioplatus M-3D/6th boss [/spoiler] require you to have extraordinary eye-hand coordination and multitasking skill. Among all enemy that resemble boss fight, i only managed to beat 6-7 boss without using cheat.\n\nThis game also has very few checkpoint on each area/boss. On adventure/platformer area, you could restart from beginning after spending 10-20 minutes where you have to avoid same trap or collect same item again. On boss fight, that means you'll need to repeat whole fight most of the time. It's could be annoying because since you're forced to find out boss behavior the hard way or repeating tedious part of the fight.\n\n3 HP and lack of difficulty option could be irritating for most modern player. There are time when i found out i only lose 3-10 HP when i use cheat and beat the boss. If there's easier difficulty where i have 6-10 HP, i could beat more boss by myself. But don't get me wrong, i feel really satisfied each time i beat boss (which i deemed can be beaten with practical amount of effort) without cheat. If the developer bother add easy difficulty which has higher player HP, give more Nana and slightly lower boss HP, far more people could enjoy this unique piece of artwork.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nWhile i have some rant, it's really unique experience even though i've played few hundred games. In overall, i have more positive sentiment than negative sentiment of this game. But even though i choose \"Yes\" when Steam ask \"Do you recommend this game?\", i'd rather choose \"Neutral\" or \"Information\" instead. If you're fan of 80's game or really like difficult game, you might come to like this game. But for most people, i'd recommend you to seek other game. Although if you really insist to play this game, you could use Cheat Engine and modify HP/Nana using value type Double (also called float64 or 8-byte float).\n\nP.S. I definitely will play the sequel (Episode IV-VI: White Meteor Saga according to the artbook) [b]IF[/b] the developer bother add easy difficulty option and more checkpoint during boss fight/exploration.",
      "I had seen this in the steam store and wanted it. I put it on my wish list and a friend got it for me. I have to say from start until now it's amazing and keeps me busy. I do take breaks from it from time to time. However the game keeps growing and always something neat to come back to. I was amazed to that right off the bat the game was made well, and wasn't like 20 patches later and it was good to go. It was a few little hot-fixes but it was already good from start in. I am super glad that I got this game from my friend. \n\nupside\n- Was well made from the start \n- developers are still working with the game and adding in new content when they can\n- Game you can play for hours if you are willing \n- Good strategy game \n\nsmall down sides \n-Not a city builder to me , so like not like sim city etc... more like a strategy game that involves having a small town ^^\n- Does take a bit to learn all the little mechanics but once you do , you are good to go \n-Still early access so from time to time you lose saves as they add content",
      "PROS-\n-finally out on steam\n-excellent factory builder with many features for easy factory automation\n-easily 40-50 hours of game play in it's current state\n-beautiful map design with plenty of space and verticality, multiple biomes each with their own beauty and quirks\n-overall very appealing graphics/visuals\n-easy to understand structures to build with but factory complexity increases overtime requiring some thought that doesn't leave you bored building your factory bigger in late-game\n-tons of potential for future updates\n\n\nCONS-\n-lacking all story elements at this point in time (June 2020)\n--multiplayer is filled with some bugs, nothing game breaking but constantly annoying: \n-only host can drive a vehicle without lagging effectively making it impossible for the person connecting to drive anything more than a few feet\n-constant de-sync on client side so don't expect to smoothly see the host's location\n-hyper tube transportation of significant length or otherwise complex shape can lead to the game losing track of the client and freezing them in place requiring a disconnect and reconnect, sometimes outside of the tube in a precarious position. \n-FPS in multiplayer is quite reduced or otherwise locked to ~60fps give or take 20, might be by design but it causes some issues.) \n\n-power production could probably be improved with higher tier coal burners and water pumps (and higher tier pipes that allow extra flow), seems simple to add but so far not an available tech.\n-difficulty of power production is what limits factory size at this point so I hope the next update brings that upgrade (only so many pure coal nodes and oil nodes)\n-somewhat limited water sources in many biomes\n\nfinal thoughts: over-all a great purchase, but I wouldn't blame you if you want to wait for more stable multiplayer or for the game to be finished.\nEarly access isn't for everyone but for me I just see it as getting to replay the game a few times over the development.",

      "Tomb Raider is a fun game that is really well made. It has outsdandingly fluid, cinematic, and rewarding third-person cover-based combat, and is set in a cool, mysterious environment that makes it feel like a sexier version of an Indiana Jones movie. \n\nIn the end, the question of whether or not you should buy this game comes down to a few items:\n\n+ Do you care about the Tomb Raider IP in general? If so, then that’s a pretty obvious point in this game’s favor!\n\n+ Are you interested in gender politics in videogames? If yes, then this is a title you should probably play at some point, to form your own opinions on how Crystal Dynamics dealt with the Lara Croft reboot in a contemporary context.\n\n+ Do you like cinematic games with quicktime events? If yes, you’ll really like this one, but if no it’ll probably kinda piss you off.\n\n+ Do you love platforming and puzzle solving? If you do, then you may or may not be disappointed here. Tomb Raider's platforming is so cinematic yet automated that playing it is kinda like watching someone else play a puzzle platformer that looks like it’d be a lot of fun if they’d quit hogging the controller.\n\n+ Are you a fan of third-person cover-based combat with a touch of stealth? If yes, then you probably don’t want to miss this one. If not, then do not buy this game!\n\n+ Is it worth the money?

      "[I received this product for free from a giveaway]. Only played for a short time, but sheesh, it's a bit of a mess both visually and gameplay wise. There's not much I can really say that would differ from what's shown in the trailer (rather crude MS-paint looking drawings with a few short looping backgrounds). You jump when moving right or left, flappy-bird esque, you dodge stuff going across the screen and from the top, which is a bit boring to me, but some may enjoy it more. You also have to go out of the screen to dodge sometimes, but also if you go too far out (who knows how far) you'll die as well.

      "Ok so let me start off by saying that I absolutely loved the first game in this series. I loved the subtle changes when you compared character interaction throughout the game as you progressed playing non-lethally/lethally. Now I never buy games at launch, I always wait for sales. When I got Dishonored 1 for $2 I was blown away and mad at myself for waiting for such a sale. I would've happily spent more on that game, it was worth it. Now all that said, here we are at Dishonored 2:\n\nPros\n- Mechanics have been vastly improved upon and the gameplay is just so much more fluid. As much as I loved the previous game I can't deny it was somewhat clunky.\n- Customization is so much better! The upgrades are plentiful and the bonecharm crafting system is awesome once you realize what you are doing. It really expands on how many options you really have at your disposal.\n\nCons\n- The difficulty still just isn't there for me. I LOVED that there was a custom difficulty mode, but even making things harder than the 'very hard' difficulty I still completed the game using no powers and never getting detected with relative ease(I did save A LOT obviously). The only things that really present a challenge are the clockwork soldiers, and as the plot of the game makes evident, you really don't encounter those enough to really present a big challenge.\n- The story is weak, plain and simple. It was like you were on a storyboard that used the same format as the previous game. The story, especially the universe and how you were immersed into it, was a big part of the why I loved the first game.\n- How low vs high chaos is handled. It isn't like there are no changes, in fact I was surprised a few times in my 2nd playthrough which I was doing as a hardcore murderer of every man, woman, and child(if there was any) that crossed my path. It just never really changed the dynamic enough like Dishonored 1 did. The way the final mission in the first game played out when comparing no killing playthroughs with bloody ones was VASTLY different right from the start of the mission.\n\nAll in all it wasn't a bad game. I still definitely enjoyed it for being a niche genre game. Just maybe I would have liked the game to stand out more like the first did.",

Rowling, at a time far before Harry & friends were even born. You’ll play as a fifth year student in the titular magics academy, admitted this late because of unspecified ‘special circumstances’. The virtual rendition of Rowling’s works is nothing short of exceptional, with not only Hogwarts itself, but also its environs (like the town of Hogsmeade or the dangerous Forbidden Forest), all recreated faithfully and down to the most minute details. Of course, some things will differ from movies and books, with the game being set in the 1800s. \n\nThe main story follows the classic ‘manifest destiny’ archetype, where your custom-made character will discover hidden potential that ties them to a greater purpose. Despite some genuinely memorable characters and some interesting side- and main-quests, the overall narrative can’t help but fall a little flat and stale, especially towards the ending phases. Nonetheless, many enjoyable adventures await you. Notably, there are no romance or love/hate dichotomies in the relationships you have with side-characters, as your choices will always end up in pretty much the same results during questlines.\n\n[h3]Exploration, Collectibles & Secrets[/h3]\nThe world is vast and visually magnificent, peppered to no-end with points of interest that often hold collectibles, currency or other utilities. Initially on foot, and later on with the iconic enchanted brooms and even flying magical creatures, you’ll be able to explore at leisure and clear the enormous amount of side-activities. A good portion of these, however, will prove inaccessible until you gain the right spells or abilities, in a sort-of ‘metroidvania’ fashion that promotes meaningful backtracking. Fast travel and an item-highlighting spell prove invaluable in saving time while exploring. Collectibles are mostly cosmetic, enabling the customization of both your wizard and your own private room once you unlock it, to suit various styles. \n\nMost dungeons and locations have additional puzzles or hidden paths that often lead to collectibles or extra resources; exploration feels rewarding, with a genuine sense of mystery surrounding each new point of interest you’ll find. Despite that, most dungeons and locations play out in the same way, and become repetitive in the long haul.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2933385898\n\n[h3]Combat System & Bosses[/h3]\nMagical battles use spells as sole means of offense and defense. Usually against multiple enemies at once, sometimes supported by allied NPCs, you’ll have to time your protection spell right in order to deflect incoming attacks, or dodge-roll away in case of unblockable ones. Enemies are varied and range from magical creatures to dark wizards and goblin soldiers, to name a few. Some of them may be weak to specific charms, others have shields you can break by using specific spell categories (damage, utility, movement) or other special abilities, like immunity to certain effects. \n\nCombat feels engaging, well-paced and is more than a little gory for this universe’s standards, death will be far more common than in the movies or books. The way you can combine spell effects to your advantage and use the environment further adds to the base system, while the amount of passive upgrades with item traits and spell-related talents you can gain progressively add another layer of depth. In late-game however you’ll become overpowered between potions, passive traits, talents and endgame spells - so much that supposedly fearsome dark wizards will prove little more than a nuisance due to power creep.\n\n[h3]Quests, Minigames & Challenges[/h3]\nQuests usually involve retrieving something, talking to a specific NPC, solving a treasure hunt based on visual clues, getting the solution to logic-based puzzles and more, depending on the case. While some side-quests are unique and memorable, most will be fetch chores or dry open-world shenanigans that you’ll have to repeat over and over in the same fashion. Less, but more meaningful and unique quests would have been better than this bloat, for sure. \n\nChallenges are paramount in unlocking unique bonuses like increased inventory capacity, many cosmetics, and even unique passive upgrades to equip in gear pieces. They often require you to slay X of a specific enemy, finish X of the same activity, and such “long-term” goals. Some of them are a massive grind and will only give you the 25th pair of gloves you don’t need, or other cosmetics that aren’t worth the effort.",
      "Armored Souls Prepare to sigh....\nIf you are a long running fan of this game it's a mixed bag, if you are new to the series you might like it.\n\nFor the new comers this is robots on roller skates, also screw the natural laws of physics because it makes a cool game.  The key to this game is overwhelming fire power and maneuverability. Here's the rub for me I have AC1 and a PS2 to play it on, I have every US release of this game since AC1 to AC4A, I never finished Nine breaker as it was boring. Below are my gripes, my praise, then my mixed bag in order of paragraphs.\n\nFirst the bad: this game is infested with mechanics that are from Dark Souls and have no place in an AC game.  In no order here they are: status effects, stunning other players,  firing hand weapons cause you to stop moving and leave yourself vulnerable,  repair kits (the flasks from souls), being stunned due to poise (or whatever new dumb name they called it), resupply before a boss fight, and 360 shields.  Stats effects build up like they do in dark souls, this is new to the franchise and really has no place in it, I could see heat weapons causing things to over heat more quickly and maybe some other things, the way this is done is so odd, it feels like a multiplayer add on.  Although its fun to stun bosses and other opponents, this is new to the game and feels like it doesn't belong, I can only assume its been added for competitive multi again.  There's always been this idea that traumatic impacts don't hit the pilots in this game, it's just always been like that and considering the tech it make sense. The latter is true for your AC being stunned too.  AC as a series has gone back and fourth on making you stop to fire a BACK mounted weapon unless you had quad legs or a tank base, this game is the first where a hand weapon makes you stop to fire it.  This is an utter anathema to the game in general, maneuverability and quickly timed dodges were always key.  It ruins your ability to stay moving and fight effectively, which also limits the fun in building and designing your AC.  I don't think there is an AC game in the US with \"repair kits\" yet.  I'm not saying get gud we don't need repair kits, but they are just a distraction to me with no added value.  Giving a player a very high health value is not bad, but I makes each engagement more meaningful, I need to keep my HP high, their are may fights I had where I didn't need to bother with them.  Adding to this mess is the boost before a boss fight, they were never announced like this before; whatever HP you had going in was all you got.  This sticks with me, because the most memorable boss in the whole series was the only one I cannot beat: I took too much damage before the boss fight every time, no magic box to helped me out.  For those of you who are curious it was Zinaida in last Ravens, the suicide drones took too much out of me before the battle.  In AC4A and AC4 there were 360 shields, I'm only guessing, but the shields seemed to mitigate damage.  I don't know because don't get hit or kill them fast has always been my basic plan.  In this new one, its just another health bar that exists for reasons... I don't mind the old shield system give up a defensive advantage for things like assault armor blasts.\n\nThe good stuff.  I like the mix of common enemies being easily dispatched, but still being a threat if you are too slow.  Adding to this is the more dangerous commons like the quad leg MT's.  There is a good combat balance here with crazy mini bosses mixed in like the stealth sniper bots. The bosses are big and badass, with some conventions thrown out the window like the bull charging boss not being weak after a charge. I did hate all the boss fights that involved a 360 shield. The world looks great, yup just darn purdy.  The new super fast tank base inspired by a wheel chair is dumbly fun.  The odd addition of quad legs letting you basically hover is novel and adds some depth to the outfitting of an AC.  Keeping reverse joint legs making you jump faster/higher is classic. The more effective AOE weapons on groups feels more strategic or a the very least feels damn cool when you nail three targets with one shot. Finally letting your AC back mount hand weapons and switch to them at the price of a second or two is a massive evolution, I love it, it should have always been there.\n\nSo there some other things that have changed, which I have mixed thoughts about.  There's now a thing with chips that make you more resilient to damage and other RPGesq things, cool I guess, its another reason to do the arena.  I still will kill them all until I am #1. Hidden objects are now in the game, I don't like them, but whatever, first time I have had to google anything on AC game other then where to buy it.  The plot is oddly boring for me, I think that's just me, last game being AC4A. The game announces when you are making a plot altering decision, its ok, but I would like it if the world just reacted to my decisions naturally no banners.  Weak spots on bosses,  ok its a thing, but firing an AT or plasma weapon at something (that isn't a soft spot) does nothing...not matter how many impacts, ehhh fine. \n\nI'm not done with the game, but over all fun.  Quit making armored souls and make Armored Core.  I was here before demon souls and I will be here after whatever souls, but only if you just keep making ARMORED CORE.  Is there a Japanese word for purity of purpose or ideal? I could use it to try and get my point across. \n\n\nP.S. the fan community paint jobs uploaded on line are gold.\n",
      "This was a impulse buy for me just have seeing the new \"Fury Road\", but its a great game so far was kinda shocked it ran smooth right out the gate seems like today you gotta wait a week or month before a game can run proper though. Anyways beatufiful lighting, models / textures look good, vehicle combat / driving is fun, and vehicle customization is cool too. The on foot combat feels a little too straight foward though, the gore animations are kinda boring though, like feels like its a Xbox/360 game in that way, and collecting scrap can get a little repetitive. My final thought yea this game is worth getting but if you haven't played id's \"RAGE\", I'd reccomend getting that first, it's a extremely simmilar although kinda diffrent scenario game that will quench your Mad Max thirst.",
      "Hi dev, if you were wondering whether anyone would actually use your HDR feature, I am. thanks",
      "From my nine year old: \"We like that every screen you can stop and color, and if you don't want to color there is a story part to it. We really like to do both; there are puzzles, different colors and different sections. I would definitely recommend this game for five and up year olds.\"",
      "First of all, thanks for the UltraWide support. Me and my Ultrawide companions out there do appreciate that very much. Folks who are familiar with Point and Click games know that UltraWide support is not self evident and a seldom pleasure. Black bars are not the end of the world but still. ;)\n\nAs for the game, Im not gonna bore you with a personal reference of my youth, because we all have a similar background story. They dont call us the nostalgic community for nothing. ^^\nPoint and Click adventures are \"feel-good\"-games, as Im not getting tired to mention it.  They are like books or a good movie, where you just take a load off and enjoy yourself for a couple of hours, You can always get back to them and they dont fail to make you feel better, wherever you feel bad/sad or not even feel like gaming at all. I mean, is there something better than a PnC adventure, a cup of hot chocolate while its raining/snowing outside ?\n\nAnd this one here is the mother of all P'n'C adventures. LucasArts and the Monkey Island franchise are as good as it gets. This is where everything began and where this genre got famous and hundreds and hundreds of titles have been inspired from.\nYou can hardly find any P'n'C adventure out there without a quote or a reference to the mother of Point and Click adventures.\nAnd the nostalgia hits you right between the you know what. Revisiting all those places where we spent hours and hours of our youth, meeting the lovely characters again and hearing the good old familiar soundtrack and some new interpretations of old songs makes you almost tear up and reminisce of old times.\nBetter times, as most of us would agree......\n\nHowever, the nostalgia makes you also ignore and forget about the art style which is sometimes a pain in the you know what, especially on hard mode without the clue-option and looking for a specific item without knowing if its a part of the background ore interactable. But youll eventually get over it because the atmosphere&jokes are on point and I had to burst out laughing several times, especially while reading the diary of LeChuck.\nThe difficulty is a tad too easy, even on hard mode when compared to the original games, but that doesn't affect the overall quality of the game.\n\nLets not forget that Return to Monkey Island is a fan-service to all us grownups, manchilds and youngsters at heart out there, who were raised playing this game or who have been raised seeing someone playing this game. There is no way around the Monkey Island franchise if were speaking legit video game history and Im more than thankful for this little journey throughout the past, especially if you keep in mind, that this genre is not a cashcow. We are a dying community and I hope that some of you guys got inspired again, to play all those wonderful Indie PnC games (and some of them remastered and new ones like the Leisure Suit Larry-games from Assemble), to keep this community and platform for PnC developers alive.\n\nedit:\nLove you all, guys.\n\nDo not forget, to......\"Never pay more than 20 bucks for a computer game.\" \n[except this one] ;)",
      "DON'T BUY THIS GAME!\nThis is one of the best games I've ever played. It is quite possibly the best and most detailed Choose-Your-Own-Adventure novel ever written and if you buy it now the creators will receive *NO COMPENSATION* for their work. I am thankful i bought it when I did, while they were still involved, but due to contracting and political differences (ironically fitting for the content of the game) the 2 or 3 writers who pioneered this project were cut out and can't receive royalties anymore.\nThis is a game about the inherent flaws in dogmatic political ideologies, all ideologies including centrism and being a moderate, and it was essentially stolen by capitalists.\nI love this game with all my heart. It is a beautiful story about loss, depression, and finding meaning in a chaotic and absurd reality. Anything more is kinda spoilery so I'm gonna stop myself there. It is all narrated so you dont have to read the enormous amount of text on your own and it is HILARIOUS. Depressing at times but always that spark of humor lingers.\nDON'T BUY THIS GAME. And *DEFINITELY* don't *PIRATE THIS GAME*. Even though it is totally in line with the messaging of the game, would be a HUGE middle finger to the corporation that cut the writers out of their own creation, and is super easy to do with like an an hour of searching Reddit or something, *YOU SHOULD* not *PIRATE THIS OUTSTANDING GAME*. Thank you for reading this, I hope you do the right thing, and you should totally hit on that girl at the beginning she is super into you and there will be no repercussions. Peace.",

      "Most stable game I ever played?\nPlayed multiplayer with 3 ppl living across the world from me, \nnever desynch, never a lag, never any issue at all except some very very minor stuff.\n\nMasterful really, well done.\nGREAT GAME TOO!",
      "Let's get this out of the way: If you're into Chris Avellone/Obsidian/Black Isle kind of games and know what that even means, you know what you're getting. Another clunky game with writing so good you'll forgive any of its flaws. It's another one of those games: a Baldur's Gate, NWN2, Kotor 2, Fallout: New Vegas, Alpha Protocol kinda game.\n\nIf that paragraph didn't make any sense, the rest of this review is for you. Planescape: Torment tends to be less hack-and-slash than it looks, playing according to a system roughly based on second edition Dungeons & Dragons. But in a big departure from both, you can solve a huge amount of your problems with minimal combat and the real meat of the game comes in your decision making, mystery solving, and dealing with people around you. True to the Planescape setting, Torment is a game about the power of belief and the battlefield of ideas.\n\nI don't want to oversell that because you *will* be attacked by random thugs, some combats are downright mandatory, and there is a very real difficulty spike about three quarters through the game. But the allies you keep and the knowledge you gain can help you bypass some encounters or at least trivalize them under mountains of xp gained from unraveling cosmic questions. \n\nIt's a grim, often macabre journey back and forth across the boundaries of life and death where even the happiest endings are pretty heavy, but it's also a brilliantly written, thought-provoking experience that's well worth the time and money. Just make sure to go deep on wisdom, okay, berk? Don't need some dusty penning you in the deadbook because you couldn't see the dark of things, cutter.",
      "DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU ALREADY OWN SHOVEL KNIGHT!!!!\n\nIt's a free update to the Original Shovel Knight if you purchased it.

      "I've been completely in love with this game ever since the Mojam prototype \"Wasteland Kings\" was released. It's an insanely fun, fastpaced \"roguelike-like\" or \"roguelite\" with randomly generated worlds and tons of weapons to find. On top of that, the developers stream the development of the game on tuesdays and thursdays over at Twitch and they release updates to the game every week. To me, this is the best game of its kind and I've put tons of hours into mastering it (and I still die. Often. It's difficult okay?).",
      "First of all, I really like the Game, it's Gameplay is wonderful and i really enjoy the parkour to combat mix in it. Although i noticed a lot of bugs especially in COOP i still enjoy logging on the game.\n\nThe Story is good but doesn't need a upgrade in my opinion. I like that certain map changes and Story decisions are dependant on some side quests and on each other.\n\nNow to the sad part:\n\nTencent recently bought Techland which was controversial at first, but then DL points were added which made a lot of people mad at Tencent and partially Techland, understandably.\nThey Including me don't want the game to die out because a greedy company wants to make some quick buck.\n\nAlthough i have to say myself, other Tencent bought games still are quite enjoyable.\n\nI just hope that Techland does the right thing in future and makes the current state of DL points less predatory and more Cosmetic based pure.\n\nIn it current state we still have no knifes without Bundles, but that was before Tencent so the blame for that goes to Techland, but i am excited for future updates and playing Dying light 2, even without buying DL points :)\n\nI'll give this game a solid 7/10 for the bugs, microtransactions but also because it has good gameplay and community reach\n\n(I have edited my original negative review about the pure rant about DL points because i also wanted to consider current gameplay and more)",
      "If Animus would have ever spent a night of passion with GlaDOS, then this would be their child :) Influenced by Portal series and early Assassin's Creed games, among others, this game is a mind-blowing combination of puzzle-solving tasks with a story which builds a philosophical bridge between religion and science in a way that can only be called a stroke of genius.\n\nI can't say that Talos Principle is better than Portal. It's beyond Portal.\n\nIt takes Portal's approach to first person environmental puzzle solving and, standing on its shoulders, reaches higher, offering you much more sophisticated puzzles of various kinds that sometimes have several layers and sometimes even inter-operate. The reality you are operating in is filled with messages and secrets, not unlike the world of Animus from Assassin's Creed, telling you a story and fuelling your brain. And just like in AC, you get some secondary things to do when you get tired of the \"main\" puzzles.\n\nThe graphics are fantastic. Landscapes are gorgeous. Controls are perfect. Music is superb. Voice acting is impeccable. Length is ideal. Puzzles are mind-bending. Progression is non-linear. This game might be officially \"indie\", but its quality is triple A. Or quad A. To call it non-trivial is like to say that a rocket is non-slow. And what's most valuable, is that you don't feel that profits were the top priority for the makers. The game was.\n\nThe things I love about it the most:\n• Assisted jumping. Just brilliant. If only Quantum Conundrum had it.\n• No fake puzzles based on arcade elements.\n• Weather effects.\n• I can get as close as I can to a wall and still see no blurred textures.\n• Wherever I go, I never get stuck in terrain.\n• Skippable intro movie and sensible menus.\n• Runs on my Macbook Pro.\n• Has a free demo.\n• It's so clever, it feels alive.\n\nThe things I dislike:\n• Loud \"Death\" sequence can give one a pretty good scare when comes unexpected.\n• It ends.\n\nIf you like puzzles - buy it. If you like first person games - buy it. If you like philosophy - buy it. If you like lasers - buy it. If you like finding secrets - buy it. If you like clever writing - buy it. If you like computer games - buy it! And if you don't like computer games... You just never played this one :)",
      "I have a serious love/hate relationship with Sea of Thieves. It is both one of the best games I have ever played and one of the most frustrating games I have ever played, all wrapped into one. The gameplay of Sea of Thieves is INCREDIBLE. The sailing is the best in any game I have ever played. The feeling of exploration and discovery as you blast through treasure hunts and puzzles and mysteries is unlike any feeling you can get from any other game. The cooking mechanic, the healing from food, the not-terrible fishing mechanic... all subsystems that prop up the rest of the gameplay are unique and interesting in their own right. The land-based combat is relatively uninspired, yet still satisfying when part of the greater picture that the game presents. Some of my favorite memories in gaming, full stop, come from completing long nights on the high seas or doing long-form content available in the game. The game is gorgeous, some of the best ocean/water graphics in any game. The rest of the game is equally beautiful while perfectly conveying the environment of the map you are in. I swear to Gaben that I can freaking smell the wet sand or sulfurous lava on some of these islands. The music and sound design are some of the best in the industry. Outright, the game is incredible. \n\nBUT... Sea of Thieves sweaties ruin the game for me. There is absolutely nothing worse than having a night full of fun absolutely destroyed by some player who's enjoyment of the game is derived from eliminating anyone else's fun. I understand that PvP is part of the \"pirate life\", but it is by far the worst part of the game by far. I would be willing to pay money, hell a freaking monthly subscription, for the opportunity to play SoT as a strictly PvE game with just my friends and the rest of the server populated by bots. I actively avoid playing the game now because of how many of my last play sessions started with me spawning at an outpost and subsequently being sunk less than 15 feet off the dock by some sweaty that hasn't seen sunlight since the Obama administration. I know that this is an incredibly unpopular opinion in the greater SoT-sphere, but part of the enjoyment of games is letting players enjoy them how they wish, and I really freaking wish that I could enjoy the aspects of SoT that are fun to me without being the plaything of those pirates who live only to ruin the fun of others.",
      "I even set a calendar reminder so that I could get this on release. I wish I hadn't bothered. Going great guns until I got to the passage. Game over as I can't progress. Tried allsorts to drop the jammer but unable to do so. I guess it is a case of waiting for all the bugs to get resolved.",

The game couldn't completly figure out my game pad buttons on it's own and I had to re-set every button and it's a pain in the a$$. There's a MAJOR learning curve if you think you can use the keyboard, plus I highly doubt you can hit every single button at the exact time you need to press it. If your getting this in a console then thats awesome. But I don't recommend getting this from steam and playing in your Pc. If only they had figure out the controls then I would have given 10/10.

      "Emily is Away Too is the sequel to Emily is Away.\n\nThe first game, which was free to play, was absolutely fantastic, especially because of its finale: [spoiler] no matter what you felt or what you wanted to do, your choices would always bring the same conclusion of you unable to say to Emily that you wanted to be more than friends, and her spending the summer with her boyfriend. [/spoiler]\nBut that was not because of \"lazyness\" by the developer: it was intentional, and in fact, towards the end of the game, [spoiler] even if you try expressing your feelings your character would delete what you wanted to say replacing the messages with generic questions [/spoiler] . In my opinion, the intention was to deliver the message that [spoiler] sometimes in life, especially when dealing with relationships with other people, there is simply nothing you can do except accepting other people's choices and move on [/spoiler] .\nIt was a very powerful ending that left me thinking about it for days after finishing the game, even if it was a short experience.\n\nUnfortunately, while playing this game I did not feel the same, powerful emotions that I did with the first one. This is because the game features several different endings, this time with two girls instead of just Emily, which isn't a bad thing per se, but it contrasts with the power of the message of the first one. Moreover, here [spoiler] you can actually achieve not one, but several \"good\" endings [/spoiler] .\n\nI liked the integration with your desktop and browser, plus the many different references to artists, TV shows and movies from 10 years ago.\nThere are still some \"twists\" present here, and if you make certain choices you will encounter situations similar to what you do in the first game, but as I said, I feel that they are not as effective as the original game.\n\nThat does not mean this is a bad game by any means: I would still recommend it, especially for its low price, but make sure to download and play the previous one first.

I would play Fuga 3 just for him.\n\nIt pains me to give the thumbs down, but Cyberconnect2 needs to work a little harder.",
      "I would say that [i]Pyre[/i] is a rather underrated gem from [i]Supergiants[/i], although it has very positive reviews on Steam. I believe that many players missed an important info about [i]Pyre[/i]. It's a visual novel in the first place, heavily concentrated on lore, characters and story. The action in sports like battles is just a secondary element. I was also surprised by it being a visual novel, but I wasn't disappointed. Right on the contrary. I have fallen in love.\n\nThis game is very complex and everything in it has its purpose. There is a meaning to how the story unfolds, what exact information you learn, what characters you meet… maybe you won't be able to see it during your first playthrough, but the end should make it clear and eventually all the other playthroughs… because there is still a lot to see and I will come back many times for sure.\n\nI don't want to spoil you the story, because it's truly amazing and filled with plot twists which always force me to change my plan… I can say that we get exiled to the Downside, a horrid place without any means of returning, meant for the worst criminals, delinquents and offenders of the Commonwealth. There, on wide empty plains, we are found lost, alone and almost broken by a trio of other exiles, each one of them different in species, size, personality and with different motivation in their hearts. They make us an offer, because there is a way out of this place, although it's not commonly known… not that we can exactly decline as that would mean our, probably quick, demise in the Downside wilderness. We accept and offer them our skills then, namely reading as it was banned a long time ago in the Commonwealth, because only the Reader can uncover the secrets hidden in [i]the Book of Rite[/i]s… book that holds the information on how can one obtain their freedom… and even something more.\nWe board their old wagon, which had seen better times a lifetime ago, and following the stars we set on an adventure looking for other suitable exiles to be able to unite and to fight for a better future not just for us, but for all the others.\n\n[i]Rites[/i] are the action parts of the game. I would describe it as a mix of basketball and American football. There are three players on each side, the main goal is to grab a ball and toss it into enemy fire. Winner is the one who extinguishes the opponent's fire first. Fights are short, fast paced and if you are not careful you can lose in a blink of an eye (especially on a harder difficulty). As you progress through the story you recruit new characters into your “squad\", each have a different cast of abilities and more importantly also behave completely differently on the field. You are always given an opportunity to try them out, but it can be a challenge to master them properly. The ones who participate in the fight gain enlightenment (a lot of experience), those who are on the bench gain inspiration (next time they participate in the fight they level up faster). And here comes the catch. The ultimate goal is to get free, but only one can leave this place once he is deemed worthy and [b]you[/b] are going to choose which one it is, from the three most enlightened. [b]You[/b] will send away one of your exiles, never to return. So the one you play most with, your best one will be gone and you [b]have[/b] to play with the others… never forget that.\nThis concept adds another level of immersion, because you are now torn apart by the choice waiting for you. Will you allow them freedom or will you deny it? But you and your crew aren't the only one seeking their freedom, there are others you have to fight with and yet again they all have different desires and motivations to go back. Nothing is easy and maybe sacrificing your own freedom to offer them chance for their own may be the stars will.\n\nThe cast of the characters you meet in the game is big and pretty diverse. Their personalities are excellently portrayed and all of them are very much likable, some of them have written deeply into my heart. There is no standard voice acting as no one is speaking in English, except for [i]The Voice[/i] (tiptop Logan Cunningham), instead they have an \"extra new\" language. And they only speak in short lines, few words, sights… but that's all you need. It's so amazing, it fits the characters so much. I wouldn't want it any other way. You can also open info about all of the characters in the game, learn about their past… and in the end even about their future.\n\nIn addition to a great story and characters we have bright, vivid, colorful graphics full of tiny details, it's a joy to look at. Next thing that is creating a great fitting atmosphere throughout the whole game is the soundtrack, which is exceptional! Darren Korb is truly ingenious. His music is full of emotions and perfectly captures every situation and character. I really like the soundtrack in [i]Alan Wake[/i], especially the songs which tell the story plot, I have found it very clever. Darren Korb, and the [i]Supergiants[/i], simply brought it to perfection, because their storytelling songs bring me goosebumps every time I hear them.\n\nAs is usual with other [i]Supergiants[/i] games each character has a skill challenge, which will grant you artifact designed right for them. You can also make fights harder by enabling disadvantages against yourself in the form of better stats for your adversaries and worse stats for your triumvirate. After completing the main story you can test your skills against others in multiplayer or just against a CPU, that's also fun.\n\nI can wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who loves great compelling stories with beautiful visuals and soundtrack; you won't be disappointed. Be prepared that you are going to read, do not skip or rush through it, the story is the important thing, not the action.\nThere is only one thing I find unsatisfactory about the game - I would love to be able to romance one of the characters. ^^",

      "Where to start.... in short entire game is boring and very slow paced for no aparent reason.\n\nAI: AI performs only very basic functions and does not upgrade buildings and does the opposite of whats beneficial for your empire. AI does not do very well when engaging in displomacy.\n\nUI: You will spend most of your time trying to manage/hover around very CLUMSY and absolutely disgusting UI. Other 4x games offer far superior UI and make is easier to manage your asset on the field e.g. Sword of the stars II, Star Ruler 2, Distant world, Endless Legends, Endless Space etc.\n\nGFX: Graphics are not the top notch what you would expect from a modern 4x game but they are on far with Endless Legends. GFX leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nAlien Races: I dont need to say much but like Planets most of the races are COPY / PASTE. Nothing unique or special about each. \n\nMP: Multiplayer has a mind of its own and in most cases wont let you join public games unless its a private game.\n\nStellaris bring nothing new to 4x Genre in 2016!.\n Right now everyone is almost beta testing for the developers so we can find bugs, report them  and help them fix their game.

I once engaged in a conversation with a developer at SI about FM, and football in general. After some talking about premier league, and me slightly confused, I eventually understood that this developer thought that Tottenham Hotspurs were located in Liverpool. So I posed him the following question: \"Then why do they call any matches between Tottenham and Arsenal the 'North London Derby'?\" to which he responded that he did not know, but he assured me that Tottenham F.C was located in Liverpool. I had to resort to showing him the borough of Tottenham in London for him to understand that Tottenham Hotspurs is not lovated in Liverpool, but in fact in London.\n\nThis will be the last edition of this game series I will ever purchase. In a football management simulator such as this, letting SI and their employees (including the one that responded to this review) tell you various aspects of football, is like having a pervert preach to you about the virtues of sexual absitence. They know nothing, and since the core game has not progressed the slightest in 10 years, it would be a fair assumption that they do not care neither.\n\nFuck SI, Fuck their beloved \"devs\" and fuck Charlton Heston while you're at it.",

      "I didn't want to review this until I was completely done. I've now 100%'d the game. Quite simply, I think everyone should play this game! It's perfect for puzzle players with easy and difficult puzzles, most of which feel very satisfying to solve, has fantastic commentary about all of the perspectives of today's society (it's not just a one-sided view!) and is a genuinely well-crafted game.\n\nMost facets of the game are positive so I have to point out the negatives in the game.\n1: There is no save/load system, it's all automatic checkpoints and you have to go and back up the files manually if you want to see the results of different choices.\n2: The choices you can make, or miss, have some light dialog consequences but they occur over many hours of time. This is something I don't really expect from a puzzle game that used to always tell you \"you can return to any place you want at any time.\" In this game, you can't. The time of day and weather of locations can irrevocably change, the ending itself has some major changes, yet there's no way to see it all without replaying the game (a tough pill to swallow for a puzzle game) or watching the results on YouTube. I'm kinda against that sort of thing unless your game can be played multiple times and be different each time, which this won't be, because it's the same puzzles each time.\n3: The engine is Unreal 5 and it's very unfortunate. Although the game may have been easier to develop for multiple platforms in a faster time via doing this, but it has proven that Croteam's old Serious Engine was a much better engine. Unreal 5 has horrible eye adaptation, anti-aliasing, lighting, and geometry options that are all proven to be horrible via this game. Don't get me wrong, the game runs and looks fine for the most part, but all of it could look better and run better had it been built on any other engine. Yes, *any* other engine. I'd sooner have played this on the Source engine. Epic's Lumen and Nanite technology is still too unproven, early, and crappy to be the generational leap they claim to be. I hope the developer can better tune this stuff so players can have better framerates, less ghosting, better lighting, and eliminated distant object pop-in.\n4: The game's pace at the start and end are worse than they could be. The beginning spends too long (and a lot of later optional dialog depends on your exploration of this) in an open world without puzzles while the end has a final puzzle that includes a frustratingly tedious walk-about aspect that needed to be shortcutted somehow. Everything in between (including the breaks you get back in the open world bit) is perfectly crafted and paced, though.\n\nThese things said, I still insist that if you enjoy any form of puzzle game, like Antichamber or Portal, you play this game. You will enjoy it!",
      "This is a game, a story, about love. \n\nIt's also about time, tragedy, about hope, hate, despair and everything that falls in between. It revolves around a cursed mansion and its inhabitants in different time periods and explores and questions themes like identity, trust, desire, violence, society, redemption, reincarnation, [i]reconstruction[/i]; a mind bending reexamination of lives lived. \n\nIt's about the big things in life but it's also about the little things. The things that constantly shapes us when we're not really looking, that gives our day-to-day its meaning and substance. \n\nBut more than anything, it's about the complexities of love. Love as a motivator, a discomfort, a longing, a heartache, a blessing, a curse, but most of all, as a relationship: the uneasy steps out of individual comfort zones and the creation of something new together. Love as a path to growth.\n\nIt's almost perplexing how they manage to make it all work, it's structurally among the most ambitious tales I've ever witnessed in video games, but they do, it does work, the missteps are few, the memories of it all absolutely enchanting.\n\nIt wouldn't have worked without the astonishing soundtrack. It handles everything with surprising ease, frames every scene with emotion and wonder. \n\nIt wouldn't have worked without the art, the beautiful depictions of scenery and life, the characters and their subtle expressions.\n\nIt wouldn't have worked without the interaction, the implications of the choices feels real.\n\nIt wouldn't have worked without the prose, but it wouldn't have worked as [i]just[/i] prose. \n\nWhich is why it's a video game.\n\nAnd it's the greatest love story on Steam.",
      "Oh, that The Resident Evil (The RE)… One of the best stories in the gaming industry! The Capcom is well done that decided to remake games. Many players criticize The RE3, but I understand them, the game is quite short, there are no horror elements in the game. But the game has become easier, for example, a knife does not wear out. The players did not forget to criticize the Nemesis too, saying that there is no element of surprise and persecution, and there’s no sense of the constant presence of someone, who can mutilate you. The Nemesis means in English as “a good script”. However, the game creators tried to convey the atmosphere of The RE and the horror that the doomed city is filled with. Well-chosen actors, excellent voice acting, correctly conveyed the atmosphere of the city. I would add more moving elements on the destroyed streets of the city, like people or zombies\nTotal score: 8.5/10",
      "I'm gonna be honest with you. If you are not live in SEA, I'm not recommend you this game in case of lag and ping. Sometimes I play with one of my friend and we got 200+ ping but the other 3 got 60 ping even we are in Thailand so I guess this game send us to Europe or North America server. You may experience what we got but more often if you are westerner.\n\nAnd don't listen to the people who said ThE sPeCtEr ArE iMbAlAnCe. Most of them play less than 10 hours, try playing specter and you will know how hard specter can be with just a survivor who know how to play or know the loop just a little, even the teleport and sprint skill won't help you.\n\nOkay, the review. This game has a lot of potential and ridiculously fun but lack of balance. Specter kinda overpowered for the newbie due to their skill that can teleport to nearest survivor and can see all survivor with a windwalk skill (Things change when you face the survivor who know what to do). And yes that is the starter specter. And the most thing that make survivor hard to win even in a good team is the syringe(med kit) is really hard to find and you are rarely got a chance to heal yourself.\nThe one thing that really disturb me is when you perform a ritual (like generator from Dead by Daylight) you are in the position that expose yourself and the specter can see you clearly. Don't make me wrong, survivor kinda fun to play due to you can bully specter with a lot of item.\n\nIn summary, this game need some balance patch (I mean a lot) and server problem that need to fix (maybe there are a few westerner that play this game so they didn't invest a lot in EU or NA server). Overall this game is fun to play and better than Dead by Daylight if you ask me, but need to be polish.",

I am not the kind of person to normally go in for conceptual hipster nonsense, and I say that because that's what I thought this game was. \n\nIn reality, it has some of the best atmosphere and writing I've seen in a game in a very long time.

      "A new game from Zeboyd, you know I'm there! And this was such a fun game\n\nThis game is about as long as Cthulhu Saves Christmas and it's just as Linear. However given their statement on this video, that's meant to be the point these days.\n\nThe Graphics for the main game are basic but it's fitting for the Genre. Also they have dropped the random battles with on screen monsters to avoid if you want to not fight (And you still have the option to start a battle through the main menu). The fighting system is identical to CSC too which I've enjoyed but I can understand those who may not like it. The Animation for the transformations are incredible...except I'm always stuck watching them every single time which can get very tedious.\n\nThe story is clever, and they provide \"Translations\" for the Ole English of Shakespeare...but a lot of the translations are jokes and very silly ones at that.\n\nThere isn't a LOT of replay value but you will enjoy the story enough you'll want to play it again eventually.\n\nThere is no New Game Plus mode...yet but given how they patched it into CSC later on I'm certain they're do that here eventually.\n\nI say the game is incredible for the price range and is entertaining for all ages.\n\n\nVIDEO REVIEW: https://youtu.be/wuw9pJPowqM",
      "I love this game. I've clocked over 300 hours in it through Origin (on my ONE character xD ). It's an excellent game, even despite it being an \"open world faffaround simulator\" which was all the rage at the time.\n\nAnd finally on Steam!? Yay! Or yay..?\n\nBut, as we know, we can't have good things. Massive thumb down to the EA Origin \"integration\" in Steam. EA, how about just stop being such massive ducks?\n\nThis is the same \"we hate our customers\" behaviour expressed by d-bags like Ubisoft and Epic. Only that EA sort of makes it worse. They *know* how much people hate the unnecessary and malicious Uplay \"integration\" that Ubisoft have forced on us for several years. Seeing this, EA decides that doing the exact same thing, with their total-garbage Origin client made even worse, is surely the only way to harass the customers enough to be worthy of the EA brand. \n\nDO NOT BUY OR LINK your Steam account if you own the game on Origin from earlier. \nIf you buy a game on Steam, which you already own on Origin, it will overwrite your Origin game.\nIf you then refund the game on Steam, this will remove the game from Origin too (even if you already own it there!), and you'll spend hours in line to get a hold of customer support. Then you must chat with bots, or people who are so void of understanding (and likely not paid near enough to care) that they might as well be bots. And if you're lucky, you might, after going through 4 or 5 different \"agents\", finally get to talk to a person that comprehends English and is authorised to do anything beyond telling you \"they'll discuss it with their team\". Then you might get your game back. \nBut! You won't get back the GOTY. Because the Steam-Orgin-GOTY overwrites your Origin GOTY. And when refunding, via Steam, you're left with a dumb/lame/placeholder copy of the GOTY in your Origin library, which doesn't work, but somehow just lingers there. Then you need to get a Digital Deluxe Edition + all DLC to get back to where you were.\n\nThis [integration] is such a tremendous show of manure, that I'm actually left wondering if EA planned it. Did Andrew Wilson take one of his billions of pocked change and say \"hey, we should make an extra effort here, to make sure that this integration is as frustrating and poorly implemented as possible, but still functional, such that things are barely limping along but just barely, because nothing is as frustrating as something that just barely sorta works but only sorta, and only by the skin of its teeth. That'll teach those entitled peasants.\"\n\nSo yeah. Great game. Bad EA.\n\nUpdate! A new Origin experience: The EA App! An all new website, wrapped inside an all new Electron wrapper! For an all new Frustrating(TM) experience and much better hogging of your PC performance.",
      "I had to purchase Scarlet Hollow after witnessing the excitement of Episode 4 through my friends. I immediately binged the first three episodes the following day and found myself and in rather different spot compared to their playthrough. The choices you make in SH are actually impactful - which is (unfortunately) quite refreshing for the genre! I've since run through several different routes to explore more of the story (and collect those achievements!). While you have the ability to skip through previously seen text, lines within replayed conversations are shaped by your selected traits, choices, and previously selected dialogue; you won't be skipping that many lines before seeing new content. Similarly, characters may be painted in an entirely different light based on choices you've made. The cast and writing truly nails the small town feel of SH (gossip and all). \n\nMake sure you eat the takeaway container in the fridge. Thank me later.",
      "I played OT1 before OT2 and, unlike most people, I really enjoyed it and didn't really understand all the hate around it. \nAfter reading multiple times that \"OT2 is so much better than OT1,\" I just couldn't see how an already fantastic IP could get any better, so I bought this game.\n\nAnd now I see it.\n\nThey took Octopath Traveler 1 and cranked everything up to 11. The world is gorgeous, detailed and worth exploring. The stories are exciting and incredibly well written. The combat has seen many changes, increasing the skill ceiling and giving the player more options and strategies to work with. The OST is quite frankly a masterpiece, simple as that. \n\nThere's so much more to say about this fantastic game and all the improvements and changes they made, but it will be much better if you see it for yourself.\n\nI definitely recommend this game, even at full price. 8/8",

AI characters shooting through walls.\n2.) Poorly realised inventory system (You can't compare stats of your secondary weapon with inventory items)\n3.) Camera does not follow actions during combat\n4.) Right click items in inventory and you do not always get the correct sub menus.\n5.) Mouse & Keyboard use was definitely an afterthought in terms of design\n6.) The frustrating click to confirm attribute/perk/talent spend.\n7.) UI does not always detail consumed action points to move to a location during combat\n\nAs I said lots of irritations that normally, in an indie game such as this, you would expect... but NOT when the publisher charges AAA prices.\n\nEz\n",

      "First of all - Subnautica is a good game. Very atmospheric, very scary and overall a really overwhelming experience. At first. \nThis might be the only negative review in this month, but I think some of you might appreciate a different view than \"omg this game is just awesome\". Which it kinda is, but in some points it maybe isnt.\n\nThis first section of the review doesnt contain any major spoilers for the story, just a comment on the overall progress through the game stages.\nAt the time of writing this review, I played the game for ~ 35 hours, I have advanced quite a bit. The first few hours were fantastic, I was looking for new things to explore, the blueprints for all the stuff that I need and every new thing felt like I made a progress. But then at a certain point nothing new happend. It seemed to me like I had all resources I could ever need (even the blue crystals), I had all the vehicles you could build, all the upgrades I needed.\nAnd then there was no challenge anymore. You build your submarines, your bases and the game gets too easy, its not a challenge anymore. Don't continue reading after this point, if you havent played the game yet.\n\n[spoiler] The big strength of this game is the immersion in the seemingly endless underwater worlds. But at a certain point this immersion breaks (at least it did for me).\nNone of the monsters can really harm you, not even the biggest ones are a real threat. Just hop into you seamoth and out-speed everything. If there is a leviathan, just hug the walls or strave, they cant catch you. And if they do, just step out, repair your ship and continue. None of the threats is really dangerous. You really need to have bad luck to die. And if you do ... nothing happens. You just respawn.\nAt first the map seems endless, since you cant move fast. But once you get the seamoth, the map is very finite. Sure, there are deeper levels you cant access with the moth, but everything on the surface is within reach. Its the same with the deeper levels and the prawnsuit.\nSurvival is hard at first, since you constantly need to get water and food. Once you can plant you own food, you have unlimited supply and the survival aspect becomes just an annoyence.\n\nAnother thing that bothers me is the amount of resources you need to build stuff. In the later part of the game you need to build a giant structure. But the necessary resources are just like \"get 3 wooden planks, 2 nails and a hammer\". And with these resources you build the statue of liberty.\n\nMy last point is about the storyline. After something like 15 hours into the game there was a major stall for me - I had no clue where to go, to me it seemed like I searched everything I had access to at that time. I searched for 10 hours and found nothing. I went to the Islands twice to check if I missed anything, but no. I dont know, maybe I just had bad luck and something didnt trigger right, I missed a hint somewhere or something. It eventually went on, but on that point I already had the big submarine, the prawnsuit and everything. The story felt like I just need to run from A to B and back, there was no challenge anymore. \n [/spoiler]\n\nSo anyways. If you made it this far in the review, thanks for reading. If you disagree with me, thats totally fine for me. I don't want to ruin the game for anyone, maybe the points that bother me dont mean much to you.\nI know that my critique is pretty harsh. There are many positive aspects in this game. If you can really dive into this game and fully roleplay it, submerge in its story and ignore some flaws, this is a fantastic game.\nBut maybe some of you are like me, so some of my mentioned points could bother you too.\nThanks for reading, I hope I didnt butcher the English language too badly, feel free to comment, if you like.",
      "UPDATE: This remains to be one of the best games I have ever played. The company that created the game though... One more launcher that is completely unnecessary. The performance with the 'next-gen' update is horrible. I have half the fps I used to have on the very same rig and that is after going lower with the settings that I used to have. Why did you have to do this b U Ll $I t?\n\n\nThe best way to embrace the true greatness of this game is to look on how the series has improved since the first and the second part of The Witcher. You simply won't find anything that hasn't changed for the better.\n\n- Vast open world that IS NOT randomly created and filled with dull stuff,\n- Story which engages you from the first 10 minutes to the very end,\n- Graphics, even despite the whole controversy of a thing called downgrade, still makes this game THE BEST LOOKING RPG ever created,\n- Soundtrack, it finally goes back to the style presented originally in The Witcher 1, something that makes you forget that's just the video game, it gives you the feeling you are in there, in some village, city or that you are fighting with someone / something, which turns every single battle into an unforgettable memory,\n- Every single side quest, and believe me, there is A LOT of them, is actually a little story that keeps you playing with the same force as the main quests - I call it - a new quality in RPGs,\n- Choices and their impact on the story - even a small choice that seems insignificant at the time can wage on the whole world around you,\n- THIS GAME IS MATURE, finally a game dealing with a lot of subjects which are usually handled very childishly or not at all,\n- Combat - nothing more to add, it's decent, though it's nothing to be praised really, you won't be able to mash buttons and win - you have to dodge, use signs, and on higher difficulties get yourself ready to have an oil for a specific enemy and a bomb to be able to put an end to his or her misery.\n\nThe Witcher 3 is not a game without its flaws, although nothing that can't be fixed - some balance issues, economy basically showing Geralt as a very wealthy person (who he should not be), small performance problems like stuttering in Novigrad and in my opinion very limited after the end content (fixed by the expansions). Many of the things I struggled with have been already fixed and there is no need to disclose them. \n\nAll in all, one of the best games in the last few years (even a decade).",

      "A solid \"Get Va11HallA instead, unless this is on sale. Otherwise, maybe.\".\n\nCoffee Talk: Fantasy Coffee-brewing Action, is a day-by-day visual novel with slight coffee-brewing mechanics on the side. Its storyline is broken up into several days, of which customers visit your coffee shop and talk. The first few days are rather short: no longer than a few minutes, but as the story advances the days become more packed with story. The game as a whole is rather short, less than 3 hours to complete the main storyline. Overall, generally a well rounded game, but not $15. On the other hand, it compares rather poorly to Va11halla, a game with a nigh identical format, but has more characters, story, and charm. If you liked Va11halla, and really can't wait for N1RVAnnA, then get it on sale. Otherwise, just get Va11halla.

The answer is no, and even if it was, the way you handled this games issues makes me wish I could refund this game and remove your games from showing in my store. I hope no one buys the DLC honestly, I know at least I won't.\n\nIf you want a review of the game, yes, they did seem to iron out most of the issues, however since I haven't played in quite awhile due to me spending too much time apparently gearing my techromancer just to come back and am unable to handle what I could before the \"balancing\", has turned me away from this game. Reducing a classes viability or power in a PVE/CO-OP game boggles my mind. It's like saying, \"Oh you don't like the other classes since they do less damage and are harder to accomplish the same goals? Well let me crush your class into the ground so they all feel the same. Have fun!\"",

      "I bought this game in order to review it, seeing as there were no current reviews for it. \nI thought I'd help the game out by maybe giving it that tiny bit of publicity it needed to get off the ground.\nIn doing so I have failed. As this game isn't worth reviewing, there is nothing to review. Well, I should say there is stuff to review but I feel as though the dev's didn't even attempt to make this a game that anyone would enjoy. Well actually I'll let them off of the target of \"enjoy\", I'd go further to say it doesn't even feel like they tried to make a game that someone who had nothing to do and was bored out of their mind would say maybe I'll play this for a bit\nI jumped straight in, ignored the help in menu and started playing. It took me at least 4-5 mins before I even had the slightest concept of what was going on and what I had to achieve. Once I did get the hang of it I still thought \"I must be missing something, I'm not really doing anything\" so I ventured to the help menu to find that nope, thats it buddy.\nThe controls are lacking, the soundtrack and the sound effects (which happen to be a melody playing) do not blend at all, (they play completely out of time on top of the soundtrack).\nYou can buy it and prove me wrong, go ahead.

      "I cannot belive the Q_Q from the negative reviews... so many spoiled little brats or total internet nooobs that do not know any better...... just mind boggling...... beyond words......\n\nGreat game even for early access, spent all my time so far solo on my own PVE solo game, will be playing with my friend(s) later.... a few hit box detection issues, if you load your bow and abort you will have the arrow in your hand no matter what you try and do, even with the axe in your hand the arrow will still be there til death... so just minior little things like that so far... \n\nFantastic graphics, I have everything on ultra and no issues, makes for some really great screenshots.... \n\nNo nudity, partial nudity (topless and loin cloth), and full nudity... tastful nudity as in \"female full nudes are especially lovely and artful\", cannot really say the same for the male character nudes however..... may have seen some.... questionable gifs or images floating around already... so I think that side of thing could have been take care of a bit better than that and made more tasteful since some images are \"questionable\" and quite Porographic... so that will leave a nasty impression of the game for many hopful customers and a stain on the Conan universe....\n\nHad little or no issues with buildings... I built a 3 story houe, last top room was 2 blocks high so do not feel cramped... I built a good long bridge to a big high wide rock, took about 4 pillers and they were about 4-5 blocked high and about 3-4 blocks apart... so good bridges are very possible to keep high and out of danger from NPCs at least and to make good use of tall rocks for base extentions... one issue I have is with stairs, you cannot have a ceiling block and a hole for the starts otherwise you head with get stuck and you cannot pass up the stairs... but you can crouch for a sec and go up the stairs... so a minior bug\n\nSooooo much potential for this game, sooooo many possibilities for this game, the sky is the limit... Devs are on the RIGHT TRACK !!.... I love the total freedom for those that want PvE or those that want PvP, many server configurations to play with to how you like, if you play solo you can even play around with the Admin features and go nuts building amazing buildings, spawn NPCs of all types and numbers.... I love the freedom, many games do not give you this much freedom to play how you want to play and that is how things should be....\n\nGood work Devs.... I was a big Fan of AoC and I was there on the first day and many months, but the combat mechanics in that game got boring fast... this game is simple and I dont think it should get much complex than it is now... so it is a good system\n\n",
      "[h1]Dishonored 2.[/h1]\n[i]If old Samuel could see me now...[/i]\n\n[b][u]Introduction[/u][/b]\nAt its core, Dishonored 2 is little more than a mechanically and narratively contiguous continuation of the Dishonored formula. This isn't a bad thing - the first Dishonored was one of the best stealth-action games of all time - but innovation is too often overlooked in the games industry. DH2 does bring some nuance to the franchise, but new drawbacks are packaged in as well. Put plainly, Dishonored 2 is a game I adore just as much as the original, but there are aspects that certainly left me wishing for better.\n\n[b][u]Plot[/u][/b]\nThe game begins 15 years following Empress Jessamine's assassination, and her daughter, Empress Emily Kaldwin, has ruled the isles since that time. Her father and Lord Protector, Corvo Attano, advises and keeps close watch over her at court. Quickly after Dishonored 2's opening however, the Duke of Serkonos, Luca Abele, comes to Emily's royal tower - bearing a gift. He brings Emily's supposed long lost aunt, Delilah Kaldwin, who then immediately stages a coup in a bid to take the throne. She is successful, and you must escape the city of Dunwall as either Emily or Corvo (more on that later). You then travel to Karnaca, the capital of Serkonos, where you begin a personal crusade to [i]take back what's yours.[/i]\n\n[b][u]Technical Revamp[/u][/b]\nShifting focus for a look at DH2's presentation, the game is gorgeous. There's a hint of the old, comic-book-like aesthetic that was present in the original game, but the graphical fidelity has been greatly improved in this sequel. The textures, lighting, animations, visual effects, and environments are all elegantly rendered. It's easily one of the most beautiful games of 2016. As for the audio; sound effects and voices are realistic, and the OST is as iconic, if not more so than the first game's. Although, when it comes to performance, Dishonored 2 clearly falters. DH2 was a technical mess on launch, and while it runs decently now; some bugs, stutters, and crashes still persist. Overall the presentation is good, but the performance is surely sub-par.\n\n[b][u]Setting & Exploration[/u][/b]\nAs stated earlier, Dishonored 2 is set in Serkonos's city of Karnaca; known as The Jewel of the South. Gone are the dark grays and subdued browns of Dunwall, as Karnaca replaces them with bright, pastel blues and yellows. The metropolis has distinct cultural differences from Dunwall as well, whether it's the widespread use of wind-power over whale oil, or Karnaca's reliance on silver mining to employ its working class. In terms of level design, DH2's stages are much more expansive than anything seen in the first game too. There's lots to explore in every district of Karnaca, especially when verticality and hidden locations are taken into account. There's several routes toward all objectives as well; emphasizing Arkane's \"play your way\" motto. All considered, Dishonored 2's game world is exceedingly well-built.\n\n[b][u]Depth in the Details[/u][/b]\nOne of the most effective ways DH2 differentiates itself from its predecessors is through what I'd call 'structural gimmicks.' To break up the standard pacing, a couple of the game's missions have special set-pieces which can completely turn gameplay convention on its head. An example of this is the 'Clockwork Mansion' on the fourth level. This inventor's home has levers in essentially every chamber that reconfigures a room's layout - such as turning a trophy room into a grand hall. These levers can be used to access new areas or evade enemies, and even reveal traversable spaces behind the walls. It's this degree of imaginative design depth that distinguishes Dishonored 2 from most other games in its genre.\n\n[b][u]Stealth & Combat[/u][/b]\nMoving over to the core gameplay loop, not much has changed from the first game. The stealth and combat are still just as exquisitely implemented as before, with only a couple of refinements. The deviations that come to mind are that drop-assassinations can now be used non-lethally as drop-knockouts, and assassination animations are a much more brutal (but cathartic) spectacle to watch than before. Dishonored 2's central mechanics are near flawless to be sure, but this sequel suffers by adding few new gameplay elements to the mix. Except - well - there is one big feature I've neglected to elaborate on as of yet.\n\n[b][u]Emily [i]or[/i] Corvo[/u][/b]\nIn Dishonored 2, you can play as either Emily Kaldwin, [i]or[/i] Corvo Attano. When Delilah first takes the throne you get a moment to choose one or the other, after which the character you don't pick is turned into a cold, stone statue. Both Emily and Corvo have separate voice actors and personalities, but they share the same goal throughout the game's duration: to save the last of their family, and reclaim the throne for the true Kaldwin heiress. After receiving the mark of The Outsider, Emily and Corvo have different magical abilities too. Where Corvo has blink, Emily has far reach; or where Corvo can stop time, Emily can chain together the lives of her enemies, and kill or incapacitate several people at once. All in all, the decision to allow the player to progress the campaign as either Emily or Corvo was a stroke of brilliance in my estimation.\n\n[b][u]Main Story[/u][/b]\nReturning to the main story - it's another point of criticism for me. There are some magnificent aspects; such as the nostalgic callbacks to events in the first Dishonored or reappearances of some of the original game's best characters, but all considered most of the writing is retreading a beaten path. Just as in Dishonored 1, the game flows from mission to mission where the chief objective is simply to eliminate a key player obstructing your path to the throne. This is perfectly fine from a gameplay perspective, but it can lead to a bit of déjà vu from a narrative outlook. Dishonored 2's writing quality isn't poor, but it doesn't distance itself from the comfortable story-staging of its predecessor, making it feel slightly lazy.\n\n[b][u]A Reactive World[/u][/b]\nOn the other side of the same coin, the narrative reactivity of Dishonored 2's world to your choices is truly admirable. Playing DH2 in high chaos; where you murder many people throughout the game, results in huge environmental storytelling changes compared to low chaos. Here's an example. If you flood the streets of Karnaca red with blood, subsequent levels show you've harmed the city's inhabitants before you even arrive. Citizens’ moods and perceptions will have soured as they become depressed or monstrous in the wake of their crumbling city - causing suicides and murders to spike throughout Karnaca. And corpses bring bloodflies, which further tarnishes The Jewel of the South in a vicious cycle. You can, of course, avoid all this... by showing a whole lot of care in your actions toward others.\n\n[b][u]Conclusion[/u][/b]\nWhen all is said and done, the Dishonored formula is a fantastic one that it's hard to not have fun with. Karnaca is riddled with environmental detail, the stealth mechanics are flawless, combat is devilishly enjoyable, and the game judges you intelligently on your choices. The Dishonored IP is incredibly strong... The tweaks provided are appreciable; I just wish DH2 had made a concerted effort to make it even stronger. But, god-dammit, I enjoyed Dishonored 2 way too much over it's 20+ hour campaign to critique it any longer. Get the game and play it - despite all my pissy complaints, you won't be disappointed.\n\n[h1]Personal Rating: 9/10 - Absolutely Outstanding[/h1]",
      "My first console was an Atari 400 so, I may be a bit partial and nostalgic.\nHowever. its not like I haven't played these games in forty years.\nThis is a truly amazing release that I hope other developers follow.\nIt's a documentary, a museum, and a games collection. They meld into brilliance. This is well worth the price of admission. You get documentary segments interwoven with artifacts, internal documents AND THE GAMES.\nDid you just watch a segment, read the internal documents from development? Yeah? Why not give the game a quick go!?!\nTons of games spanning the beginning arcade to the Jaguar, with all the tasty history thrown in.",

      "Ni no kuni II: Revenant Kingdom is a great RPG that, while a little dissapointing in some aspects, makes up for it with it's positives.\n\nLet's start talking about the negatives: \n\n- the characters are a little bland, most of them barely get anything added to their backstories nor are there any specific sidequests for them (yet). They're not bad, and Evan/Roland are good characters, but the rest falls a bit short.\n\n- The soundtrack is a little forgetable, even if it does have a few good gems in there\n\nNow the \"neutral\" points:\n\n- The main gameplay is simple, with only a few attack buttons and barely any combos, so if you're looking for a deep combat you're going to be a little dissapointed.\n\n- The story is simple; i personally enjoy it and how it ends but i could see someone who's looking for some deep story to be left unsatisfied.\n\nNow for the good aspects:\n\n- The graphics are beautiful, it's basically a playable Ghibli Studio movie\n- The gameplay (both combat and army based) is fun, fast and rewarding to do, especially when you unlock more spells\n- The kingdom management is simple to do and it gives you a sense of pride and accomplishment (unlike EA) when you expand it with new building and bigger borders\n- The sidequests are for the most time fun with cool citizens to meet and recruit\n- The random dungeons are cool to explore\n\nI played 85 hours of this game and i enjoyed every second. If you're a fan of Action RPG with a touch of base management and \"tactical\" combat you're certainly enjoy this beauty of a game.",
      "This review only relates to the single player campaign. At 50 years old I have zero interest in multiplayer.\n\nAfter playing Gears of War 4, I was looking forward to this title. I wasn't disappointed. I found the new upgrade system with Jack enjoyable. The campaign was fun to play with minor exceptions. Graphics, sound, and voice acting were amazing. Campaign took me about 11 hours to beat. I consider that well worth the $60 I paid for the game.\n\nMy only real gripe about the single player campaign:  As a father of 3 girls, I'm all for strong female leading characters. Kait just isn't it, though. I didn't care for her in 4 and that didn't change in 5. For me she seems out of her league and just isn't believable as a team member. She's like Elizabeth Swan, the governor's daughter in Pirates of the Caribbean. She's a kidnapped damsel in distress in one movie, and the Pirate King in the next. It just doesn't work, for me anyway.",

Each weapon has a unique set of combos you can invest in.  When you learn how to use these combos, you'll find that enemies who were infuriating to fight against being defeated much easier and the game becomes more challenging and fun over frustrating.\n\nSummery: This game isn't Dark Souls, So stop playing it like it is Dark souls!\nHighly recommend! \n\n\n",

Automatic watering systems aren't available until later on and if you are like me you will think making the biggest profit possible year one is a great idea but I accidentally ended up upgrading/unlocking everything except irrigation in my first year and now do not have much to spend my currency on.

      "Gone Home is... okay. There's nothing particularly terrible about it, but it's hardly this amazing, revelatory experience that it's been portrayed as in the media. It's just a very short, straightforward game of exploration, in which a fairly simple story of teenage love and rebellion is fed to you through bits and pieces of notes and spoken journal entries you find while exploring a large, abandoned house. But this game does absolutely nothing innovative, unlike the pre-release hype proclaimed. There have been hundreds of games with more compelling stories, and this game introduces no original mechanics. I took my time and explored the entire house, and I beat the game in three sessions totalling 81 minutes.\n\nAgain, it's not bad, it's just an utter ripoff for $20. I got it in a large Humble Bundle package, paying about a dollar for it, and it's decent value at that price, but there's no way I'd pay more than five bucks, and even that is stretching it.

Instead of being a zombie-survival game with awesome building mechanics where you could build huge and massive bases, it simply became a zombie-killing grindfest, where bases don’t matter, because zombies chew through concrete like it was nothing.\n\nAlso, don't get me started on the zombie AI. It was fine in alpha 16 and the zombies acted as you would expect; dumb. In alpha 17, the pathing of the AI is just ridiculous, where the zombies are able to estimate the path of least resistance, as if they were not only sapient, but extremely intelligent.

In Alpha 16, you could improve cardio by running, you could improve mining-efficiency by, well mining - so on so forth. Now, you just kill zombies to gain exp, get perk points and then spend said perk points. To be fair, they have buffed exp gains from other activities recently, but you still simply gain and spend perk points - yet another horrible downgrade.\n\nAlso, let’s talk about loot. In Alpha 16 you could loot items ranging from quality 1 to 600. Weapons and certain tools had components of individual quality that you could then combine to form said weapon/tool, that would have the average quality level of said parts. The quality would determine the damage/durability of the weapon etc. This system was great and gave an incitement to go out in the world and continue to loot, even if you had, say the AK47, because you could improve it vastly by finding better parts. This has been replaced by a system where all weapons/tools are looted whole in a quality system ranging from 1 to 6. Yes, 1 to 6. Minimal difference in damage/durability, but hey, at least you can attach mods to the weapons now. The amount of mods you can attach are determined by the level of the item. You can now improve the damage of your rifle by painting it in another color. Great…\n\nThe performance of the game… hehehehe. All the new textures and lighting of A17 has brought so many performance issues, and yet again, it used to be just fine in Alpha 16. Don’t bother mentioning it to the devs, they’ll just give you a douchy response about your rig being a potato, even though you’re running with high-end parts. \n\nIn conclusion, no I would not recommend the game. However, you can opt in for playing Alpha 16, which I would recommend – if you can accept that the game might never evolve any further.",

Rowling, at a time far before Harry & friends were even born. You’ll play as a fifth year student in the titular magics academy, admitted this late because of unspecified ‘special circumstances’. The virtual rendition of Rowling’s works is nothing short of exceptional, with not only Hogwarts itself, but also its environs (like the town of Hogsmeade or the dangerous Forbidden Forest), all recreated faithfully and down to the most minute details. Of course, some things will differ from movies and books, with the game being set in the 1800s. \n\nThe main story follows the classic ‘manifest destiny’ archetype, where your custom-made character will discover hidden potential that ties them to a greater purpose. Despite some genuinely memorable characters and some interesting side- and main-quests, the overall narrative can’t help but fall a little flat and stale, especially towards the ending phases. Nonetheless, many enjoyable adventures await you. Notably, there are no romance or love/hate dichotomies in the relationships you have with side-characters, as your choices will always end up in pretty much the same results during questlines.\n\n[h3]Exploration, Collectibles & Secrets[/h3]\nThe world is vast and visually magnificent, peppered to no-end with points of interest that often hold collectibles, currency or other utilities. Initially on foot, and later on with the iconic enchanted brooms and even flying magical creatures, you’ll be able to explore at leisure and clear the enormous amount of side-activities. A good portion of these, however, will prove inaccessible until you gain the right spells or abilities, in a sort-of ‘metroidvania’ fashion that promotes meaningful backtracking. Fast travel and an item-highlighting spell prove invaluable in saving time while exploring. Collectibles are mostly cosmetic, enabling the customization of both your wizard and your own private room once you unlock it, to suit various styles. \n\nMost dungeons and locations have additional puzzles or hidden paths that often lead to collectibles or extra resources; exploration feels rewarding, with a genuine sense of mystery surrounding each new point of interest you’ll find. Despite that, most dungeons and locations play out in the same way, and become repetitive in the long haul.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2933385898\n\n[h3]Combat System & Bosses[/h3]\nMagical battles use spells as sole means of offense and defense. Usually against multiple enemies at once, sometimes supported by allied NPCs, you’ll have to time your protection spell right in order to deflect incoming attacks, or dodge-roll away in case of unblockable ones. Enemies are varied and range from magical creatures to dark wizards and goblin soldiers, to name a few. Some of them may be weak to specific charms, others have shields you can break by using specific spell categories (damage, utility, movement) or other special abilities, like immunity to certain effects. \n\nCombat feels engaging, well-paced and is more than a little gory for this universe’s standards, death will be far more common than in the movies or books. The way you can combine spell effects to your advantage and use the environment further adds to the base system, while the amount of passive upgrades with item traits and spell-related talents you can gain progressively add another layer of depth. In late-game however you’ll become overpowered between potions, passive traits, talents and endgame spells - so much that supposedly fearsome dark wizards will prove little more than a nuisance due to power creep.\n\n[h3]Quests, Minigames & Challenges[/h3]\nQuests usually involve retrieving something, talking to a specific NPC, solving a treasure hunt based on visual clues, getting the solution to logic-based puzzles and more, depending on the case. While some side-quests are unique and memorable, most will be fetch chores or dry open-world shenanigans that you’ll have to repeat over and over in the same fashion. Less, but more meaningful and unique quests would have been better than this bloat, for sure. \n\nChallenges are paramount in unlocking unique bonuses like increased inventory capacity, many cosmetics, and even unique passive upgrades to equip in gear pieces. They often require you to slay X of a specific enemy, finish X of the same activity, and such “long-term” goals. Some of them are a massive grind and will only give you the 25th pair of gloves you don’t need, or other cosmetics that aren’t worth the effort.",
      "I vividly remember the moment when I gave up on Fallout 3: I was the ruins of some city, with a grey sky looming over the shredded grey concrete shells of buildings, and vast chunks of broken grey highway was wrapped up against, around, over and under huge chunks of grey concrete. My companion had gotten stuck somewhere in the grey sea of rubble for the umpteenth time, and it just suddenly struck me: This game isn't fun. It's just depressing.\n\nA few years later, I recalled this experience to a friend of mine, and he assured me: \"Fallout 4 isn't grey. It's got colors. And it's good.\" Having banked 1410 hours in game, I would have to say he was right.\n\nIs Fallout 4 good RPG? Nope. The story is rubbish, the characters extremely shallow, and the skill tree is very meh. If you hate VATS, like I do, the skill tree is complete rubbish. Is it good because it is bug free and has good DLC's? Nope. Is it good because it's the best shooter ever? Nope. Fallout 4 is good game because it's fun, and it's fun because it's a decent shooter, with an OK open world, good atmosphere and a sense a humor. Slap some of the 1000's of existing mods on that, and there's a decent chance that the next time you emerge from the elevator of Vault 111, switching to the catchy tunes of Diamond City Radio as you ready your gun and take in the not-grey landscape, you'll be smiling, just like I do.\n\nUpdate: Due to the recent Skyrim \"update\", breaking mods and introducing paid mods, and a similar downgrade being reported as coming for Fallout 4, I can no longer recommend this game, or any other Bethesda product.",

      "I'm gonna be honest with you. If you are not live in SEA, I'm not recommend you this game in case of lag and ping. Sometimes I play with one of my friend and we got 200+ ping but the other 3 got 60 ping even we are in Thailand so I guess this game send us to Europe or North America server. You may experience what we got but more often if you are westerner.\n\nAnd don't listen to the people who said ThE sPeCtEr ArE iMbAlAnCe. Most of them play less than 10 hours, try playing specter and you will know how hard specter can be with just a survivor who know how to play or know the loop just a little, even the teleport and sprint skill won't help you.\n\nOkay, the review. This game has a lot of potential and ridiculously fun but lack of balance. Specter kinda overpowered for the newbie due to their skill that can teleport to nearest survivor and can see all survivor with a windwalk skill (Things change when you face the survivor who know what to do). And yes that is the starter specter. And the most thing that make survivor hard to win even in a good team is the syringe(med kit) is really hard to find and you are rarely got a chance to heal yourself.\nThe one thing that really disturb me is when you perform a ritual (like generator from Dead by Daylight) you are in the position that expose yourself and the specter can see you clearly. Don't make me wrong, survivor kinda fun to play due to you can bully specter with a lot of item.\n\nIn summary, this game need some balance patch (I mean a lot) and server problem that need to fix (maybe there are a few westerner that play this game so they didn't invest a lot in EU or NA server). Overall this game is fun to play and better than Dead by Daylight if you ask me, but need to be polish.",
      "[H1] GUIDE TO THE PURCHASE OPTIONS [/H1]\nso heres how you can tell the difference between what your buying, because you don't wanna be like me, who often bought packs that did the same thing. \n\nHitman 3 standard edition - Just Hitman 3, so no Hitman 2 or 1.

      "Remember when Doom 2016 released the multiplayer beta test first, and we rightfully worried the game would be a flop? Thankfully, the campaign instead blew us away.\n\nI enjoyed my first run through 2016, but only moderately so. In the original Dooms, if you never stop moving, enemies truly can never hit you. With 2016, however, enemies lead their shots if you move predictably. Also, if you leave line of sight, the demons will fire several more predict shots, in case you re-engage from the same vantage point.\n\nI failed to adapt initially. Instead, I blamed the game, claiming it felt unfair compared to the originals.\n\nThen, I stumbled upon Clockner's playthrough of Doom. He showed me a skill ceiling I never dreamed possible. Next came ByteMe's speedrun performance at QuakeCon 2019. I noticed when the demons charged their shots, he would at times hold still and bait for them to aim before dodging at the last second.\n\nThe excuses were off. Doom has transformed after 25 years. The enemies are now more intelligent (yet not overly so). I too needed to evolve.\n\nAs I took on my Ultra Nightmare run (over 3-4 months), I developed a deep knowledge of every level, and in the process, became fond of every inch, as if the entire UAC and Hell were my homes. UN felt like such an accomplishment. After that, I tried to take on an all runes/weapons/challenges mastered run (no grinding). I failed the first two times. With Eternal around a day or two away, I just completed this challenge on my third try. Personally, I leave satisfied with nothing left.\n\nI initially had gripes with 2016, only to learn the developers were one step ahead. When a team/game proves me wrong, I am loyal forever.\n\nDoom 2016 will now be uninstalled from my machine, never again to be reinstalled. May your thirst for blood never quench. And may we never need you again.\n\nTo me, Doom 2016 is also Eternal 🙏.",
      "It's about time i wrote a proper review for one of my favourite games ever.\n\nRivals of Aether is a platform fighter that tries to follow Super Smash Bros. Melee and P+'s footsteps by making a competitive focused game, but also while trying to keep it more accessible than the former. The game also has a very active workshop that allows players to create their own characters and play ones made by other creators, alongside custom made stages and buddies.\n\nI will focus on the purist aspect of the game first.\n\nAs for many \"smash clones\", the game will feel very familiar to people who already played a smash game, with the controls being nearly identical but with some key differences:\n\n1. THERE'S NO SHIELD. Rivals of Aether is probably the first game in its genre to forgo the iconic \"bubble\" shield, choosing it to replace it with a parry instead. Parries are riskier, staying out for a few frames, and will reward you immensely by either stunning the opponent or reflecting their projectiles. Since parrying is so risky, the game's neutral and defense (but also its offense) will be focused on movement, especially thanks to wavedashing, wavelanding alongside some more niche or character specific movement techs. \n\n2. THE STAGES HAVE NO LEDGES. This means your way to safety when you get knocked off the stage will be actually landing onto the main platform, rather than aiming for the ledges. Rightfully so, the game offers much more options when offstage compared to smash games, with every character having access to wall jumping, an airdodge that doesn't send in freefall and the ability to walljump and cancel special falls, allowing you to use your up special two times. This means the offstage game is a lot deeper than in other game, as there will always be a way back onto the stage since almost every character is allowed a lot of freedom while in disadvantage.\n\n3. THERE'S NO GRABS. There's not much to add here; the absence of a shield makes grabs unnecessary, and thus they're not present in the game. Some characters have command grabs, though.\n\nThere's a total of 14 characters in Rivals of Aether (free from the beginning), with 4 more to come in future patches. Although the cast might seem very slim for people who are used to smash games, it's incredibly diverse. Enough to probably warrant you to try every character. Each character has a lot of depth and can shape the stage in some way. Some fighters take inspiration from smash characters, such as Clairen having a tipper mechanic like Marth, or Absa having Ness and Mewtwo's movement turned up to 200 and Zelda's lightning kicks; this means you'll probably find a character you're familiar with in case you're not confident to play with a brand new character yet. It's also worth mentioning that the game is very balanced, with tiers being very subjective. Regardless, RoA's current top player plays the character that is considered the worst in the game by most, so that should prove that the balance state is very good.\n\nNetplay is not perfect, but it's very good and playable. As i'm writing this review, there's currently a beta build that includes rollback netcode, which presents a couple of bugs and desyncs but does its job quite well. Default build uses delay netcode, which also works just fine in case you're dissatisfied with the rollback beta. Rollback is expected to become the default build once the dev team fixes all its kinks.\n\nEvery stage has both an \"aether\" (casual, with hazards) mode and a \"basic\" (competitive, no hazards) mode. Every single stage in \"basic\" mode is tournament legal (with the exception of tempest peak in some regions), adding a lot of stage variety. Aether stages are aimed for a casual audience, with some spicy traps and whacky platform arrangements for a more casual and laidback experience.\n\nOn that topic, there's no items in this game, so the chaotic free-for-all  factor goes down by a notch, to the discomfort of players who like the party game side of platform fighters.\n\nThe community may be small, but it's very active and constantly organizes weekly and monthly tournaments, with the active (financial and whatnot) support of the game devs themselves, so you will quickly find a community in which to play. Sadly, though, having a small community means you'll be bound to experience some \"dead lobbies\" from time to time.\n\nSolo play, i'll have to be honest, is incredibly lackluster. This game was mainly thought to be played with other players and as a result, single player content is very scarce. There's an arcade-styled story mode which only features a handful of characters (the original 4+2 more), that will have you fight some random fighters until you reach your character's \"rival\" at the end of the story. The cutscenes go from average to bad, depending on the character's story. Each story is very simple and resolves itself in the course of 5 encounters, with a super boss+ a final cutscene once you complete every character's story mode\n\nThere's also \"endless abyss\" mode. It's similar to smash's multi-man mode, where you'll fight a never ending horde of weak cpus, with some minigames slapped inbetween, like a platforming section or explosive enemies. You will have to fight a weaker version of the story mode's boss after a set number of waves each time. The most interesting part of this gamemode is probably the rune system. The rune system will allow to buy runes with the in-game currency that will make your character stronger, be it by making them faster/more powerful or improving their moves. These runes can also be used in abyss versus, which is basically pvp but with runes.\nSadly, endless abyss can become repetitive very quickly, with its never changing waves and gimmicks and grind you have to go through to be able to buy (and use) your runes.\n\nThere's one more mode called Tetherball. It's actually a PvP mode, but i'm putting it in the solo play paragraph because it's a very casual mode. Simply put, the goal of this mode is to hit a beach ball that is attached to a pole by a string and make it spin around it. You score one point when the ball-on-a-string completely wraps the pole. You will have to fight your opponent to keep the control of the ball, as they can hit it as well and make the ball \"theirs\". It's a very fun but often shunned aside mode so i felt like putting it in this review. Please, play Tetherball with me. \n\n\nAs for workshop...\n\nIf you're not big on the competitive scene of platform fighters, this is probably why you came to this store page and. as you may have gathered, casual play is not very fleshed out, with only aether mode and some solo modes as your only options. That's where workshop shines! You'll be able to download hundreds of play made characters, some with the intent of being serious, competitive fighters, while others (most) are aimed to a more casual audience. Characters can go from original characters to the reckless wii mote guy, so you'll have plenty of fun by browsing the worshop page and finding the perfect character, be it an original character or a direct transposition of greninja from Smash Ultimate. Needless to say, you'll also have a huge choice of stages and music packs, alongside some hidden gems like new gamemodes that often pass under the radar. I bet you didn't know you could play Uno in Rivals of Aether!\n\n\n\nTo wrap things up, i'd like to comment on the great pixel art graphics which does its job very well and will appeal to retro gamers specifically, and give my shoutouts on the incredible OST made by flashygoodness. Every track fits the stage perfectly and gives the right atmosphere to this fast paced fighting game.\n\nIn other words this game is a very good purchase for both casual players, thanks to the workshop, and competitive players because of its deep yet accessible design. I hope this review made whoever is reading it consider buying Rivals of Aether and join the community.",
      "You know what?\n\nI was so ready to give this game a negative review. \n\nSure, the style, atmosphere and music are jaw-dropping. However, the gameplay (specifically the combat) didn't really click with me until I defeated the first boss after ~50 tries (yes, really that many). The combat was just not what I signed up for. I was expecting 2D Zelda with more fluid combat, but I got was a top down Souls game. Expect to get stunlocked, die in a split-second and generally get this shit kicked out of you.\n\nAfter I came to terms with that, I actually started having fun.",
      "Loop Hero is a reverse tower defense (you make the monsters/area to fight your hero) deck builder (determines what you can place) roguelite (there are persistent progression elements) idler (you don't do anything except place the tiles and equip items).\n\nNow, you'll probably be like me and first glance at the game and think it's ugly and a hodgepodge of genre words that is low effort.\n\nI played the demo for 5 hours because of how good it is. It blew me away. \n\nThe game is fantastic.\n\nThe art is great pixel art that looks fantastic in motion.\n\nThe combination of genres works great, everything comes together in an addictive smartly designed manner. You'll constantly be telling yourself just 1 more loop.\n\nThe game has a \"eurojank\" style of design - which is to say, it gives you a very basic tutorial and then not much else is explained. You will do a lot of experimenting discovering cool hidden combos and really trying to optimize your strategy here. There's a solid amount of hidden depth that isn't explained to you. This may or may not appeal to you based on your sensibilities.\n\nThe game currently has 4 acts, a lot of progression upgrades, and the devs have said if the game does well (which it looks like it has) it'll get DLC in the future.\n\nVerdict: PLAY",
      "*Sigh* This game was just tiring. I wouldn't come to say it was a complete rip off of Paper's Please, but it was a very similar game but just worse. Mainly to the point that I played, at most, 10 minutes, I saw multiple repeats of the same messages, and the only updates were legislation, unlike in Papers, Please where you got new rules and new tools almost every day. I won't completely judge the game since I haven't played it the entire way through, but it's just not very good. Plain and simple.",

      "Most puzzle games demand you to think 'outside the box'. In Baba is You, there is no box. This game will present to you so many simple yet impossible levels, you'll swear your game is bugged. But there is always some ingenious, big-brain solution, hiding in plain sight.\n\nIf you look at the comment section of any Baba is You solution video, you will find no shortage of angry commenters. They will claim, \"That's not fair! The game never taught me I could do that!\" even though it has. In a moment of weakness, they blamed the game and not themselves.\n\nHere's the thing - you cannot expect to try multiple permutations of one-dimensional solutions and expect to make progress. Baba is You will not give you the satisfaction of beating it for free. You will have to push the rules to its limit. You will have to create infinite combos, clip through walls, and build complex machinery using nothing but four words and a rock.\n\nNow, that's not to say looking up hints or solutions is bad. Unless you're like me, who has zero respect for their time, it's perfectly reasonable to say no to another hour of banging your head against the wall for one level. But when you do decide to wave the white flag, don't go telling the game dev off for making a game that finally respects people's intelligence, just because you feel it disrespects your stupidity.\n\nIf you ever happen to be part of the 2.6% of people that beat all 200+ levels in this game, know that it will be a lonely achievement. Your parents, who have never touched a video game in their life, they wouldn't understand. Your old high school buddies, who only contact you when they need something, they wouldn't understand. Your Steam friends, they've never even heard of Baba is You, they wouldn't understand. \n\nBut know, just know, that I will understand.",
      "I only just found out about this game when it released. Saw a few videos and had to get it.\n\nI'm a musician, and instructor. Have been playin music for most my life and this game kicked my butt. \n\nThere's parts of each level that groove and feel \"right\" while a lot of the rest of the level doesn't seem to fit with the tempo/time signature, (each level number represents it's time signature). It frustrated me a LOT. I felt like the devs put in those groove sections to make it seem like a rhythm game but most the filler was just an out of time mess.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nThe more you learn about the mechanics, which are actually fairly complex for one button and stick, the more you'll apreciate how finely tuned this game is. So, a lot of the patterns don't exactly groove like typical rhythm games, but once you start feeling how all the more advanced scoring mechanics work together, you'll start feeling the music in really interesting ways.  It's hard to explain, haha.\n\nYes.... your thumbs will get sore playing this, like... seriously. But man.... when you nail sections and feel how it all fits together there's no comparison to how awesome it makes you feel.  \n\nThere's PLENTY of replay that can be had in this, plus the music will stick with you and make you want to play more just to hear it again.\n\nIt's worth the price.",
      "This is how a Remake should be made, feels and plays much better than the original. The overall game design be it characters or the level is amazing!

      "People in the reviews don't understand this game.\n\n1. This is not Final Fantasy Tactics and it has a good reason for it.\n2. They barely removed any skills compared to the previous version and you will find most of those \"lost\" skills integrated into new skills or mechanics while certain broken mechanics were removed for a good reason. They also made things more challenging which i see as a welcome change. Things are also generally more viable and that is never a bad thing.\n3. You don't need to grind in this game, so why do i see people bring up grinding? Sure there's 40 weapon levels but in the endgame you get max level after like a couple battles if you really feel like you need to grind it out. In the previous version you had to level up a ton of different skills and some of them went up very slowly so there's actually a lot less grinding in this one.\n4. The reason you're struggling with doing damage is not because the game is bad, it's because you're not looking at what your equipment does or you don't understand it. The attack value in weapons is a base value which is used to penetrate your targets armor. It makes sense to do 1 damage against a person wearing heavy armor if you're firing an arrow at them. All the various boosts that you get in this game are applied to the damage you do AFTER you penetrate your targets armor. In order to do real damage to heavily armored targets you need to either use the right kind of weapon to attack them or make use of the new elemental system since now every character has an element that can be used to deal more damage OR you can simply apply a debuff to them since debuffs affect their defensive value directly. So yes this is not a game where you always win by rushing at your enemy and pressing attack. You have to understand how the game works and going through that process has been incredibly fun for me.\n5. You don't need to worry about those permanent stat gain cards or leveling your unit in a certain class to get the best possible stats. What you get from doing that isn't really going to make a difference if you're not playing well enough BUT if you really want to have a super powerful godlike unit, this game still allows it through those mechanics.\n6. The buff cards on the field are also not something you're required to make use of to beat the game, they're just there to make the battlefields more interesting and a way to make boss-characters stronger without directly cheating their stats.\n7. They removed random battles but you don't need random battles for anything because you can recruit units in the various long dungeons or simply go back in time to recruit a specific unit from any level in the postgame.\n\nIn summary it's a game that requires you to think a little bit but as you understand more you can also make things that seemed underwhelming at first viable because you found a way to make use of them. The story is also integrated into the gameplay so it's easy to keep interested in it especially since you get to make choices that affect both the story and gameplay. As a remake it definitely feels like they remade the game completely as it's so different from all the original versions. It's not for everyone and it doesn't have to be but hopefully the enjoyers of games like FFT or fire emblem will not dismiss this because of the reviews since this might become one of your favorite rpgs if you just bother to look into it without wanting it to be a cheap remake. It's too easy to jump into conclusions when we live in a world filled with terrible \"remakes\" popping up each year. This is all so ironic too as the spirit of this game when it comes to the story and gameplay alike is that you will never truly win by jumping into conclusions and there will always be something you didn't consider.\n\nUpdate: Replying to comments and addressing things for people who are familiar with the originals: \n\nI don't think they took away anything so vital that it would ruin the game. I can't really think of anything important other than the rogue class myself. You can call it removal but I'd rather say that they moved a lot of stuff to a different place from the list of skills and changed a lot of them to better fit the new card system and the new skill/spell limits. \n\nYes in my original review I didn't mention anything about the skill limit being reduced from 8 to 4. I think this change mostly just made the game easier to understand and when it comes to strategy I don't think anything was lost. You were going to use those extra 4 skill slots for things like strengthen or spellcraft either way and with the new scouting system moving around 8 skills before each encounter would probably be a little tedious (as it already feels tedious to setup units with the current system). \n\nAnd when it comes to spells, I simply can't understand why I would want to have access to more or all equipable spells as it would result in casters being a lot stronger than what they are supposed to be. This also makes each caster class more defined instead of them just being some kind of upgrades of each other so that a lategame class like the shaman can be a lot less useful in certain situations than your starting mage class because they don't have access to debuff spells but in return they hit super hard with their damaging spells.\n\nWhat else did they remove? They reworked the weird elemental system  into something that's always in play and I find this change very welcome as it adds another layer of strategy to the game especially through finishers and equipment bonuses even for non-spellcasters (but is still a little weird to get the hang of at first). They removed spell scrolls... yeah i probably dont have to mention why I see that as a good thing as well.\n\nAnd sure you can dislike these changes but we have to remember that steam reviews are black and white. Posting a negative review based on a subjective change is indistinguishable from saying \"this game is trash don't even look at it\" when it comes to statistics which is what everyone first sees when they open the store page of a game. \n\nI'm completely on the same page with you about playing your own favorite version, whatever you prefer and I myself would like to mess around more with things like One Vision in the future. But imo giving this game a negative review is also bad for the reputation of other versions of tactics ogre.\n\nAnd ofc the game is definitely not perfect there's still imbalances and some skills are pretty underwhelming compared to what they used to be (RIP Rampart shadows...). But imo this is better than what I've seen from literally any other game remake ever so I simply can't agree with calling it a bad remake.",
      "The popularity of this game is deserved, but very concerning.\n\nPopular indie games have a habit of ascertaining a very loud, territorial, and highly defensive following. Not only is it overwhelming for a creator, but also for its community. It creates an echo chamber that is opposed to foundational changes, which are necessary for early access games. I hope that Zeekerss will utilize this with experimental updates that explore possible additions and fixes.\n\nThat being said, the gameplay is really entertaining and complex for something that is relatively simple. It features a proximity voice chat which is ESSENTIAL, not only for the gameplay, but for the best experience. It should be played without any knowledge of its contents and with others who don't know anything either. The low-resolution, low-poly, aliasing aren't what sell its visuals - the animations, technology and UI design do. The player's running animation is cheesy as hell and it's great. A lot of the animations and movement in this game are genuinely spectacular. I haven't had this much fun with something new in a long time, and that's insanely rare for me.\n\n(Ironically, one of those recent games was DOORS, another Roblox developer game. Now, I couldn't pin it down, but I could tell it was made by a Roblox developer without seeing the splash screen. Maybe it's the jumping? The inventory slots? The items?)\n\n[Play if you like / vice versa:  SCP: CONTAINMENT BREACH, DOORS, DEEP ROCK GALACTIC.]\n\nFeedback: \n- [spoiler]The mansions would be more impactful if every location had a random chance to be one. It would need to be balanced out by that random chance becoming higher on later planets. Is it inspired by the Memories movie, by the way?[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The way the girl is handled is diabolical and I LOVE it.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]It would be very interesting to have a character that plays back what the players say.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]Something else that would be interesting is a fake player roaming around to misdirect.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The backrooms reference is way too common and is really out of place. It also wastes an opportunity to actually have some kind of rare, temporary dimensional door that a player can get separated by.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The moon interiors lack visual distinction and don't reflect their locations.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The enemy variety is pretty great, but some feel really out of place. Mines/turrets in the mansions? Jesters in bunkers? It's aesthetically dissonant. It would be much better if the enemies were categorized to be in specific places. There could still be varying overlaps; like some enemies could be in all places, some are only in one, and others are in a few but not others. This would allow for a great opportunity to have different \"biomes\" or bunkers, like military, paranormal, bio/alien research, etc. [/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]A lot of enemy designs are actually really freaky and fit within the established environments. Coilheads have a really great sound, but the giant spring is really wacky. The Jester is even worse, with a massive skull and human legs that no one can take seriously. [/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]You could have moons that play off the mechanics of a specific enemy pool to create unique, difficult circumstances.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The exteriors lack loot.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]As far as I have noticed, the mountain creatures are generally unfair. If they aren't already, they should be dependent on the presence of flashlights, glowing loot, ship lights, flashbangs, etc.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The sprint meter could be dropped, as the loot weight and footstep volume are effective in punishing the player.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]I worry that the game will adopt a system in which new moons are locked behind higher and higher costs. If it does, new content will only be accessible after playing a lot of what you've seen before, and it wouldn't be guaranteed. Simultaneously, new content could be immediately accessible, but then overwhelm and cram the base game.[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The \"days remaining\" mechanic could be repurposed as a \"liftoffs remaining\" mechanic. This would allow moons, which would have different rotational speeds, to allow different durations of visits. This could allow for longer visits with higher rewards and risk, similar to Deep Rock Galactic's \"Deep Dives.\"[/spoiler]\n- [spoiler]The game doesn't have much lore, and since that's not the focus, that's fine. If this were to change in the future, consider stronger world-building that interweaves its contents.[/spoiler]\n- The music is really out of place when it plays in interiors, but the title music kicks ass.\n- The \"taunts\" are great and I hope we get even more.\n- The health UI looks way too similar to Outer Wilds.\n- The bestiary and logs should probably be client-side.\n- The quotas should scale dependent on player quota, as more players means more money.\n- [spoiler]The turrets and mines should really detect the monsters. That's what they're there for, no?[/spoilers]",
      "An instant classic.\n---\n\nThe original [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/recommended/264200]One Finger Death Punch[/url] was an unexpected treat for me. The refined simplicity of just two buttons that require masterful timing to create a legitimate fighting experience laid out to a selection of music that reminds you of the classic Kung-fu movies of the 1970's but packaged with a carefree stickman aesthetic.\n\nOne Finger Death Punch 2 is a respectable sequel in most ways. The core gameplay is fundamentally the same while the visual indicators and special attack animations have been upgraded and made more fanciful. Other things are changed simply to give you a new experience.\n\nEvery aspect of the game is polished from the interesting tutorial to the many additional modes (survival, gauntlet, etc.) that exist beyond the (very long) main campaign. Once you get into the groove there's potentially dozens if not hundreds of hours of fun to squeeze from this.\n\nThis is a game that just has to be played to truly appreciate it as the feel of your interaction along with the music is what really defines the experience. Simply watching it or looking at the screenshots doesn't do it justice.\n\nThere are a couple of (minor) controversial changes that may not appeal to some fans:\n1. The music in 2 includes a more modernized remix compared to the more traditional music from 1. Personally I love the soundtracks from both, but there are people who have a preference.\n2. The upgrades to special attacks in 2 can be a bit of visual clutter at times. I like both styles, but there are people who prefer 1 over 2.\n3. There are some sequences (like the lightsword rounds) which did not return in 2, replaced instead by other weapons. While I think it would have been cute to include all of that along with the new stuff, it's not a deal breaker. It does however mean that both games retain a bit of unique flair and a reason for you to play and experience them both. 2 is overall an upgrade, but it's also not a 100% replacement.\n\nI would strongly suggest that if you've never played either game, you should begin with the first one. I think it's a better entry point to the series and might have a slightly broader appeal. (it's also slightly cheaper).\n\nThen if you find yourself enjoying it, come back and pick up 2 and you'll find yourself with some remixed music, fancy new special attack animations and a whole new adventure to work through.\n\nJust to be very clear: Both of these games are fantastic and deserve more praise than I can properly express and I'll very likely be putting 100's of hours into this just like I did the first one.\n---\n\nBottom line: Simple to learn, hard to master, and super satisfying fighting along with a great soundtrack.\n---\n\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38232109/]While you are here, would you consider following my curator page?[/url]\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/kunovega/recommended/]Want to read all of my reviews and not just the curated ones?[/url]",
      "Ok so... \n\nFar From Noise is a narrative game in which you play a woman stuck in its car, balancing on the edge of a cliff. \n\nIt's about life, death, nature, purpose, creativity, dreams, stars and badgers. \n\nThe thing about Far From Noise is that it'll ask you something very special, something that we all forget to do nowadays, something that I've forgotten. This game will ask you to take your time. Don't rush things. Sit down and relax as you'll be forced to follow the slow pace of the game, but you'll enjoy it, for sure.\n\nThis game is for you if you come home after a rough day at work. This game is for you if you're searching for a meaning, a purpose in your life. This game is for you if you just want to experiment something new.\n\nBecause Far From Noise is offering you something new. It gives a vibe that is between Firewatch and Life is Strange, but without all the forced action, stress, adrenaline those game wanted to give. Don't misunderstand me, I loved those 2 games, but Far From Noise chose a direction more... pure. It's just you and the nature that evolves around you.\n\nI've finished the game within 90 mins, but I heard they were several endings, so I might as well try to get some more (but the one I've got fully satisfied me, to be honest).\n\nBeing more pragmatic, the art and sound coincide perfectly. The visuals are gorgeous and the musics hit just right where it needs to. You'll be lifted by the compositions as you'll stare into the beautiful sunset, and the dark starry sky.\n\nYou may find it expensive, as the game costs 8$ for one hour and a half of experience, but hey, think about a cinema ticket. Far From Noise is cheaper and the experience you'll live in it is wayyyyy more unique than most of the movies you go see. \n\nI recommend it. Play it. It'll put your mind at ease.\n\n\n\nPS: the main character is one of the most well-written i've seen in video games.",
      "[h1]Strategy at its finest[/h1]\n\nInto the Breach is Subset Game’s latest title, following on from their massive hit, FTL. I put off trying Into the Breach for a long while, but I finally got it when it dropped down to $10 on HB a couple of months ago and I’m so glad I did. This game isn’t for everyone, it’s kind of rogue-like mech chess, but if it clicks for you then it’ll be one of the best strategy games you’ll ever play.\n\n[h1]Positives:[/h1]\n[list][*]First up, the game looks fantastic. The pixel art here is great, from the backgrounds to the mechs and even the pilot portraits. The animations here area also really good. There’s nothing too complicated here but it’s all well executed. On the topic of appearances, I also really like the way the maps are laid out, the 8x8 grids on a plain background work really well here and it reminds me of simple boardgames. I think it works well for the game.\n\n[*]As with any good strategy game, it’s easy to pick up, but hard to master. You have a squad of three mechs (there are a few different mech groups to unlock with gold coins (?) and you can also create custom groups from the mechs you’ve unlocked). Each group has a unique element, but they all follow the basic structure of one close-range mech, one long-range mech and one support mech. Each mech has a different ability/weapon and they’re all well varied. The mech teams are really well designed here so that no one mech is super powerful and they all work really well as a unit. \n\n[*]The combat is excellent. It’s really simple but it works so well. You’ll quickly learn the different roles your mechs have and figure out the best strategies to use them. There are two ways to kill most enemies. Getting rid of all of their HP or pushing them into water/lava (with the exception of boss enemies or flying enemies). However, a lot of the time you probably won’t even be trying to kill your enemies in a given turn. You can always see what the enemies will do on their next turn and so you always want to be playing to react to/prevent their next move. Typically, enemies target civilian buildings or buildings related to your objective, so it’s usually better to focus on moving them away from these buildings rather than focusing on killing them. If you’re really smart/lucky you can also push enemies so that they attack each other, as friendly fire is a major part of this game. It’s really satisfying when you line it up right so the enemies are killing each other rather than attacking you or the buildings you defend. You can even block them from spawning by moving something on top of them!\n\n[*]Unlocks in this game are handled better than in FTL in my opinion. There are six actions that you can complete with each mech squad to earn those gold coins I mentioned in order to unlock new mech squads. The first three are the three possible victories: two, three and four island (more on that in a second) and then the other three achievements are unique to each mech squad. They’re centred around the unique aspect of each squad, tasking you to get a bit creative with the way that you’re playing. I know some players didn’t like the way that unlocks worked but I think it’s a really good way to handle it and encourages you to try new strategies. \n\n[*]The game has five islands, with one of those being the final boss fight. Each island is basically a different biome with different enemies and environmental hazards. They aren’t necessarily easier or harder than each other to start with, but the difficulty does increase as you move from island to island. There is some crossover with the enemies you’ll see, but they at the very least have a different appearance and most of them behave differently. There are also enemies unique to each island. \n\n[*]On each island, you’ll need to complete several missions before facing off against the island’s mini-boss. The missions all have different objectives for you to complete, though the win condition is always just to survive all of the turns (typically 5 turns). The different objectives vary but there are usual two, with some easier missions only having one and harder missions having three. Completing these objectives gets you certain rewards. You can either get stars, which are used upon completing an island to purchase new pilots, abilities or weapons. There is grid power which restores or increases the grid power you start with (grid power is lost when buildings are destroyed, losing all grid power results in a loss). Lastly, some of the missions award power cores (usually you only see this as the third reward for a hard mission) which allow you to upgrade your mech’s weapons or abilities (super handy). The mission variety is fairly good.\n\n[*]There are a range of different pilots in the game. You always start with one ‘special’ pilot and two regular pilots but more can be found in cryo-pods or bought at the end-of-island store. All pilots earn xp at the end of missions and when they level up they get some kind of upgrade, like more mech health or an extra movement per turn. The ‘special’ pilots all have some kind of special ability, such as being able to attack twice if you don’t move or the ability for the piloted mech to fly. Some of these require a power core, but they’re definitely worth it.  [/list]\n\n[h1]Negatives: [/h1]\n[list][*]Honestly, I’m clutching at straws here for negatives. One thing I would mention is that I don’t think this game will have as much replay value as FTL does for most people (completionists have an awful lot to do here) which shouldn’t put you off from getting it, but is something to base your expectations on. I also felt like Chris Avellone was a bit wasted on this game, his writing is fantastic but there just isn’t much of it. [/list]\n\n[h1]Verdict: [/h1]\n\nInto the Breach is as close to a perfect strategy game as I’ve ever played and it’s an excellent follow-up to FTL. This game is easy to pick up, hard to master and it looks beautiful the whole time you’re playing this weird mech chess. I can’t recommend this enough and at $15 it’s an absolute steal. This was easily one of my favourite releases of 2018 and anyone who likes strategy absolutely needs this in their library. \n\nIf you found this review helpful, please check out my other reviews over at [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33633486/]Kemo's Corner.[/url]",

      "This game is far away in another galaxy from being anything but a 3/10 in my book. \nGame consists of a tack on level system with a few skills, corny jokes that make you cringe, copy paste worlds with sliding on ice, mud, or leaves depending on the world your on with vines to climb certain walls again....depending on the world your on, no dismemberment except on animals and main characters. Further all planets feel the same and after quite a few hours in the game I struggle to continue playing because of the cut and dry gameplay to where you will fight a couple animals, do some very linear parkour, then do a puzzle that will most likely include a sphere that you need to put into said location to unlock a door as such. graphics are eh..and I have to say the battlefront 2 campaign had more thought than this garbage. save your money and don't buy this",
      "\nWell, after almost a year of not playing this game, I must say, the devs did fix most of my issues. *Most*. Creative mode is fun, but you still need to collect stuff to make things, which is incredibly tedious. On top of that, the character dialogue is still really annoying and you need a NASA computer to play at a stable framerate, but hey, you can actually play without getting your ass beat. I'd like to up my ranking to an 8/10. Very fun, but I highly recommend playing with others. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOG REVIEW (outdated):\nThis game has potential, but unfortunately having fun with it is impossible if you aren't a hardcore survivalist.\n\nCritical Issue #1:\nThe main characters won't stop talking. Everytime you eat or hold the torch they say an unfunny one-liner that makes me want to gouge my eyes out with forks. Even Robin Ayou from Subnautica: Below Zero talked less, and the original game had a silent protaganist. Having characters that have constant dialogue that always repeats is just so annoying to the point where I had to turn off the volume. If the main characters were silent but atleast talked with each other, then I could see potential in that. But they just talk and talk and talk and none of it means anything.\n\nCritical Issue #2:\nThe enemies are way too hard to battle. To make better gear, you need to take on enemies that are so difficult to battle. Maybe you could say I'm just not good at battling enemies in survival games, but I was able to easily battle monsters in Terraria, Minecraft, Subnautica and Raft just fine. When your in-game monsters are too hard to defeat without gear that requires you to battle even MORE monsters, it is not fun, repetitive, and frustrating.\n\nCritical Issue #3:\nThe story is in the background. The fact that the story doesn't impact the game as much as it should is probably the worst aspect of any piece of media out there. The game sends you an a goose chase to find the  main story and it is infuriating. The story itself is all over the place. First it just seems like you need to make yourself grow bigger, but then it goes completely off the rails and into this scientist bunker with a robot that gives you quests, but you can ignore him and continue playing. I don't know if they finished the story, but so far it is not good.\n\nSomewhat Critical Issue:\nThere is no setting to dial back the graphics without lowering the resolution to look like Terraria. I can't see, and it is dumb and brings the whole beautiful vibe of being small down, ironically.\n\nMinor Issues:\nThe music is bland, and although I love electronic/synth music, this is just not it. The fact that you can't have bugs as pets or mounts, or even herd them is extremely upsetting. The farming sucks ass, it gives you 4 items of what you grew every 2 in-game days, when you can just find that item in more abundance at the place where it is located. Under the pond... JESUS CHRIST, the graphics are so bad. The wavy filter looks so bad, and you can see the entire underwater area crystal f**king clear, even though other smaller bodies of water have some kind of murkiness to it. Minor issues like this hold back the game.\n\nAlthough this is still in early access, it feels as if they wasted a lot of potential already. For such a unique world and concept, it never really exploits the amazing and obvious things that it can accomplish. Why not grow your own personal army of ants? Oh sorry, you can pick up eggs but they hatch and they aren't friendly. Why not create a raft made of weed stems and lilypads? Oh sorry, you can just build a base that looks like a boat. Although there are much worse steam games out there, and ones that I have hated more than this, this was sort of a slap to the face. It's not god-awful, and there are a lot of good things about it like the cartoony bug designs and the beautiful graphics, but honestly, it's a 6/10 bordering on a 7, and although many others have enjoyed this, being the super critical demogorgon that I am, this didn't exactly \"ground\" me.",
      "I am a 43 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he helped me. Loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.\nThank you <3",
      "TL;DR - 80-90s retro fun. Will prove you wrong if you think FMV games couldn't ever be good. Check out 5 seconds of playthrough if unsure.\nNOTE: Story isn't written in this review as game is reliant on mysterious plot. \n\n　　　For those unfamiliar, FMV stands for full motion video where you are playing a game that is based primarily/largely on the usage of pre-recorded video clips. Though it is no longer a frequented genre in video gaming, during the 90s, FMV games on CDs would often lead me into the darkened halls of many a thrilling Sherlockian mystery adventure. Unfortunately the majority of FMV games were downright awful. Pre-recorded videos with a small quantity of scenes by actual actors caused the a gaming experience to feel boxed in. Astoundingly, Her Story does the exact opposite while still being as classically FMV as FMV games go. It displays FMV like a shield of pride with the added old school touches being tasteful to a tee. As the game is \"turned on\", the screen whirring into action like any early 90s PC would, making the familiar creaking and croaking, players are introduced to their in-game desktop. The thick 90s computer monitor flares a little and in its reflection can be seen the old tube shaped fluorescent lamps that were common fixtures in most public buildings back then, flickering and popping from time to time. It is like playing a game in the past without the annoying performance issues. [spoiler]The glare on screen where you can see a better reflection towards the end made me jump a little here and there. It is fabulous as a \"moodsetter\" like many of the other suppositious yet important details that worked towards the game's impressive little plot.[/spoiler] In addition to the other details, the background music between searches where players are looking at the desktop felt like a good touch and appropriate in terms of guiding players (reacts to clips/progress etc). There is such an abundance of both subsidiary and essential detail in this game that I'd be happy with the mere nostalgia prompting ambiance. It is an added bonus, which isn't too recurrent in indie games these days where there is a deficiency in either style or story, that makes Her Story such a good FMV. It differs because players can feel as if they are in control as every person works towards the ending down a differing path depending on how they decide to investigate which is conducted solely by which searches are brought up how and when. The secret to any game that lacks the variety and freedom of choice by \"genre default\", is to give the player as much control as possible within the walls of that rigid reality. Within the uncomplicated, search - watch - find clues - check Db repertoire, players are given room to stretch and investigate on their own. The mastery is in the details so it is crucial to pay attention. Everything is told methodically and the acting that seems off in places makes much more sense once you piece the evidence and videos together. You are the \"detective\".\n\n　　　This superlative story told through proficient acting by the talented Viva Seifert (also musician/former British gymnast) weaves a surprisingly thick plot into a very lugubrious tale and the eerie horrors of the truth become more evident the more you unveil. The \"wifey killed him\" synopsis we are inclined to linger on in theory is not as discernible in-game as you'd imagine and it'll keep you guessing and alarm you at several progression points. It'll make your thoughts run wild but mostly you'll be wrong with those assumptions until you get the whole picture, as in as close to 100% off the clips as you can. The short clips have a role in that you're piecing together a very large puzzle. The splintered pieces of a total 7 interviews leaving you with 271 videos spanning between mere seconds to a couple of minutes will feel jumbled up so receiving the story in abstruse titbits as such makes you feel like your own little Jessica Fletcher and adds to the anticipation of piecing everything together. If possible I imagine it would be a fun \"couch co-op\" game for an afternoon in with a friend/SO taking notes and guessing the story together (plot contains mature content). \n\n[i]Other interesting things[/i]:\n- Doesn't stop running while you do other things so you can open up your notepad and type there if you'd rather that over pen and paper\n- Search history is helpful. Anti-Glare Filter is a nice touch. Yellow subtitles are very British. \n- The odd title is actually fittingly chosen\n- Database Checker on your desktop screen will display the overall progress you make, creating a timeline for your discoveries so investigation will be smoother\n- Each keyword brings up 5 clips at most (excluding default keyword*). Keep a list of words that stick out in clips and if you get too stuck, use default keyword to bring up whole Db\n\n*[i]Default keyword:[/i] [spoiler]BLANK[/spoiler] Using the default is not optimal. Uncovering new snippets in turn revealing new clues/plots urging you to solve the case yourself is most of the fun.\n\n[b]TIP[/b]: All clips found will have the default keyword in its details. I assigned a number for every new top she wore. Examples: [spoiler]BLANK5, BLANK1 etc..[/spoiler]. An easier method is just deleting the whole keyword for each clip watched, never to return. ;)\n\n　　　Though the sweet yet unnerving finale didn't feel as inspired, the wrap up was still nicely done. People who are new to FMV games may find it harder to get into, but it has a good depth of story to tell for the short game (3-4 hrs) that it is and I recommend it to people who enjoy a good tale. Chances are it's either going to feel like something new and interesting or old school and nostalgic. \n\n[i]Bought game on dev's site: $4.99 (Steam key + DRM free version).[/i]",
      "Screw this game.\nScrew it for having a beautifully painted artstyle that makes you think this'll be a wholesome adventure with your animal spirit pals.\nScrew it for having incredibly well-written dialogue and characters that make you connect with them as if they were part of your real life.\nScrew it for having a great sense of humor in its moments and animations. Daffodil, I'm looking at you.\nScrew it for the plethora of unique crafting minigames, especially the cooking one. \nScrew it for the many hours it takes to get through the whole story, ensuring my friend and I had many nights to enjoy the game.\nScrew it for having a heartfelt soundtrack that swells up at JUST the right time to pull my heartstrings straight out of my chest.\nAnd finally, screw it for making me cry each and every time I had to say goodbye.\nThis game touched my heart in a way very few have, and very few will.\n10/10 would ugly cry again.",
      "I knew Journey is a great game,maybe one of the best video games in history,but...\n\nI didn't know why so many people moved by such a simple gameplay.\nI didn't know why people had a Journey-Fever,even players just bought PS3 only for this game.\nI didn't know how close a relationship could be in 100mins only.\nI didn't know how bad i wished to go back to the peak and stay with my friend i'll never meet again.\n\nNow I Know.\n\n“It is better to walk with a friend in the dark than alone in the light” – Helen Keller\n\nIt was an interesting experience for me, I had never played this game nor heard of it until recently. I went and looked at the store page, My Brother/Friend Ethan-Winters Just Told Me this game in the steam store now, so went ahead and bought it. After buying it, went and started up the game some day later. Went into the game, saw another model character that looks like mine, I thought it was an AI because I had thought it was a single player game. So I decided to play along with it, we went through the story, it progressed quite fast, mainly because we both did not really bother to check out other things. The more I played, the more I realized that the guy I was playing with was most definitely not an AI, it was a genuine player. As we went through the story, our cooperation got smoother, we no longer have a solo player attitude, we would signal to each other, wait for each other and walked, fly with each other. It was smoothing, relaxing, a truly unique experience. Even with the setbacks we had throughout our progression, we never gave up, we stuck together from the desert till the end, when one of us screwed up, we patiently waited for the other, chiming to the person where we are. I remember at the end, when i screwed up a jump and did not see the other player, I was genuinely scared, sad, I frantically searched for the person but to no avail. I was distraught, sad and disappointed but I continued onward. When I went up, there he was, chiming for me, assuring me that he had not left yet. I felt happy, comforted when I saw the person waiting for me and together we finished the story. I am not one to do reviews, but it was such a unique experience among my years of gaming that I had to share it. Thank you, punks for the experience, truly thank you. And thank you, for bothering to read my review.\n\ni'll never forget our journey kind stranger.\n\nThis wasn't a game, it was an experience. I highly recommend you do this.",
      "Hi dev, if you were wondering whether anyone would actually use your HDR feature, I am. thanks",
      "[h2]Just like in the Transformers movies, Megan Fox is hot, but horrible at acting.[/h2]\n\nNow let's get to the review.\n\nMortal Kombat 1 is a reinvention of the entire story line, changing a character's entire backstory or even sworn enemies becoming brothers. The story takes a familiar story and turns it on it's head. Earthrealm must take on Outworld at the Mortal Kombat tournament, whilst also dealing with a certain scheming sorcerer. While this is technically a reboot, History is not all forgotten. Players of the old games will recognize similar locations and character motifs. Netherrealm Studios knows their fanbase well and made the game chock full of lore from every bit of Mortal Kombat media.\n\nThe gameplay is faster compared to earlier entries. There is a lot of Kombo variety this time around, even adding Air Kombos which add to the mix. The variety system is now gone, so every character will have their entire respective move sets. No more choosing what will be best in a battle. Also gone are the Krushing Blow mechanic and the Fatal Blow moves are faster with less emphasis on slow-motion X-Rays. Even the Fatalities, while still gruesome and gory, keep it nice and quick. After you clean the blood from your ninja robes, you can unlock rewards at the Shrine which nets you behind-the-scenes concept art or an exclusive skin for the characters.\n\nNow if I had to knock off a point, it would be some of the optimization of the PC port. The loading times can be absolutely abysmal at times. On a SSD, it takes 30 seconds to load a match or even just getting through a sub-menu. Other than that little caveat, the game runs well at 60 fps with every setting to the max.\n\n[h2] I give it a rating of 9/10. [/h2]",
      "Bad game. The story is bad, the graphics are meh, gameplay is bad and there isnt any nudity unlike the first one (to be clear the game doesnt say it has nudity so whatever) but at the end of the day its just a really bad game regardless. I understand that having the mirror name doesnt require nudity but everything is just slapped hastily slapped together to make a finished game. I had really high hopes from the devs of mirror but this was a big letdown as this game has nothing going for it unlike the quality nsfw elements that the first game had as its strong point.\n\nIf you are a weeb and you like the move the slot type games its ok but otherwise no need to play.",
      "Y'all couldn't let her have a happy ending, but you could have at least let the poor little baby keep Comrade Mitten. Reality is, war has no good side, no true enemy, just innocents who die and suffer.

I grew up playing the Telltale/Lucas Arts Series: Monkey Island. After discovering and playing those, I figured out that I have an infinite amount of love for Point and Click adventure games. After finishing that series, I really only played the other games made by either Lucas Arts or Telltale (Mostly because I thought they were the only creators of Point and Click games...until about a year ago, when I discovered there's an entire genre/world of Point and Click).  Of course, I must also note: The Curse of Monkey Island will always be my fav, as it was the first Point and Click I ever played. Ok...NOW...with all of that being said, I recently discovered WADJET EYE GAMES and I am SO happy I did. I would recommend EVERY.SINGLE,GAME they sell. I have played all of their MAC/iOS compatible Point and Clicks, and I have yet to be (even slightly) disappointed. I had very high expectations going in as the Monkey Island games, Day of the Tentacle, Full Throttle, Grim Fandago, etc. are some of the best games in the history of Point and Click; however, all of the games I have played from Wadjet Eye have been amazing. They have actually been so amazing that I can 100% say Wadjet Eye is at the top of my list, right there with the Telltale/Lucas Arts games. I 100% recommend purchasing and playing every game made by Wadjet Eye to anyone who likes (even those who kinda sorta like) Point and Click games.\n- you're looking for a game review you've come to the wrong place. But if youre looking for a fantastic ravioli recipe you've come to the right place.\n\nIngredients\n- To Make the Dough\n375 grams (3 cups) plain flour\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n2 eggs\n1/4 cup (50 ml / 3½ tablespoons) olive oil\n1/2 cup (120 ml / 8 tablespoons) water\nExtra flour for dusting \n\n\n- To Make Cheese Filling\n15 ounces (425 grams) container Ricotta cheese\n5 ounces (142 g/about 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons) \"3 Cheese Italian Blend\" (Parmesan, Romano & Asiago)\nNote: grate these cheeses yourself and create your own custom blend.\n1/2 cup cheddar cheese\n2 eggs, lightly beaten\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/2 teaspoon pepper\n\n\n- Extras\nYour favorite sauce for the ravioli (i.e. marinara/ marijuana)\nParmesan cheese\nBasil\nFried vegetables\nShrimp\nFish slices\nChicken pieces \nMake the Ravioli filling.\n\n- In a small mixing bowl, add the ricotta and mash with a fork.\n- Add in the 3-cheese blend, Cheddar cheese, eggs, salt, and pepper.\n- Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth, paste-like consistency.\n- Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. \n\nMake the Ravioli dough.\n\n- Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.\n- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.\n- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.\n- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.\n- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.\n- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).\n- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. \n\nFill the Ravioli shells.\n\n- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.\n- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.\n- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.\n- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.\n- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. \n\nForm the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.\n\n- Roll the dough into two sheets\n- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.\n- Fill with the ravioli mixture.\n- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.\n- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.\n\nCook the Ravioli.\n\n- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.\n- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.\n- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest \n- Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed plates\n\nServe it up.\nTop with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!\n- EDIT: they made putting easier!  I can finally shoot even and below on the first few courses.  Ignore my complaints about impossible putting below.  I'm back playing this again and enjoying it much more since the putting changes.\n\nI have a love/hate relationship with this game.  It's the closest thing to an enjoyable disc golf game on the PC that I've ever seen, and on that basis I recommend it.  Unlike most sports games, where I can play better on the computer than I can in real life, in this game that's not the case.  After six miserable hours of failure in this game I can safely promise you that I'm wildly better at real life disc golf than I ever will be with this game.\n\nPositives:\n\n- Discs mostly work the way they should (assuming you understand from IRL play how a particular disc should  behave depending on speed and throwing angle) though I feel like flight paths when you're throwing up or down in elevation are off sometimes, but if you throw a fast understable disc at too low a speed it will tail off into the left immediately and when you want to crank up and hyzer bomb the same disc at high speed it gives you the long S you expect and so forth\n- No bugs really (a couple of times the character model went wonky when a disc landed on/next to a rock wall)\n- Graphics are fine by me\n\nCons (possibly only for me, you may not suck at this):\n\n- The entire game is based on a \"stop the tick mark on a spot as it circles a ring\" type swing meter, and I'm absolute trash at it\n- Feels like no progress, other than buying discs--I've upgraded the three skill meters a lot and it has never felt like game play changed much (lol, it certainly hasn't gotten any easier!)\n- Putting is im-fucking-possible, at least for me, it's way too hard--putts that would be gimmes for a novice in real life are a crapshoot, especially if there's any elevation difference\n- After six hours I have only unlocked the first course and half of the second course . . . I may try to go back to this at some point, but for now I've given up on this sucker which is a shame--there are a bunch of other courses that I will never see (my fault, to be sure--I'm terrible at that stupid swing meter)\n\nI haven't played any better options, so while I'm probably giving up at six hours in I'd still recommend it to anyone who's into disc golf.  It's clearly too hard for me, but assuming you're not a complete klutz you will probably have better luck with it.\n- Katana ZERO? More like, Katana ZERO CONCLUSION.\n\nI had too high expectation on this game, I thought it was going to be Hotline Miami but better.\nIn the end I still prefer Hotline Miami, specifically Hotline Miami 2.\n\nOne thing I dislike is the lack of combo scoring system. \nIt's a good way to make the players act fast and execute their actions flawlessly, instead the game only has a timer bar that never runs out as a way to motivate the player to go fast.\n\nI am aware how \"pointless\" game scores are.\nBut seeing a number going up feels good.\n\nWhat happens when you kill an enemy in Hotline Miami?\n - You get to see a number pops out, and the score goes up indicating that you are doing good!\n - Satisfying bloody hit sound.\n - Throbbing light on the edge of the map.\n - Randomized dead sprite of the enemy, sometimes they get dismembered depending on the weapon.\n\nIn Katana ZERO you'd get :\n - A \"fwoob\" sound.\n - A same dying animation of the enemy getting knocked and bleed to death. Instead of getting decapitated or something.\n - Flashy slash effect.\n\nAt one point I wondered on why should I even bother killing the enemies when it didn't reward me with anything in the room with a minecart. \nWhen having the enemy being killed by the minecart or the player makes no difference.\n\n[spoiler]More like Katana ZERO REWARD. I think this is it, exactly why I am disappointed by it. Imagine playing soulsbornekiro or Hollow Knight without earning any kind of currency??? Killing the enemies would feel pointless.[/spoiler]\n\nIt's basically way more fun and rewarding to kill an enemy in Hotline Miami than Katana ZERO.\n\nThen there are other stuff like...\nUnfun stealth gameplay. \nRollspamming without consequence.\nBeing able to endlessly doing a mid air attack without having to touch the ground first.\n\nThere are also waaaay too many checkpoints in my opinion, it encouraged me to just brute force everything with roll spamming without having to worry about starting over.\nThe rooms could've been a bit bigger and longer. But also less room, quality over quantity.\n\nAnd finally, the story.\nI was intrigued by it but it just ended abruptly with a \"To be continued\".\nIt's like they only wrote 50% of it then slapped a \"To be continued\" and called it a day.\nThe game seems to rely heavily on \"mentioning stuff off screen that player will never get to see\" to tease the player.\nI already knew that the game is going to be short, but I didn't expect it to be this disappointing. \n\nIt's not a bad game, I just had the wrong expectation.\n\nI might change it to positive if I was satisfied by the DLC.\nOr maybe after beating the hard mode, I heard it's more fun.\n- EDIT: I nominated this game for game of the year (2023)\n\nLong ago I had heard about this game and how detailed and intricate it could be, and how you could spend hours upon hours building the massive empire of dwarves only for it to all come crashing down in some spectacular but unforeseen way.  Then I got into Rimworld briefly and thought it was ok, but it tended toward chaos a bit too much for my liking.  THEN I heard this game was coming to steam and I eagerly awaited it.\n\nIt's not necessarily that I was too good to play a game with mostly ascii/character graphics (I used to play them a lot back in the 1980s).  I was more intimidated by the depth of the game and not knowing if there was a wiki for it (there is) or how I'd find help if I needed it (I'm sure there's a ton of communities JUST for this game).  I expected that when it came to Steam, it'd be beefed up and worth the wait.\n\nWell it finally arrived and I think I'm STILL a bit intimidated by the sheer amount of options you have... mostly because it's not just me that I have to worry about, but a whole community of dwarves.  In the case of something like minecraft, I could dig a whole intricate tunnel and if stuff starts to go bad, I just high-tail it out of there and recover until I can go back and finish it.  In Dwarf Fortress though, if stuff starts to go bad, you can't just leave.  You are encouraged to deal with the adversity and push onward in the name of greatness... or something.\n\nIn a way it's like role playing, except you don't have to roll character sheets and you don't really control any of the characters directly.  You make decisions about where to mine, what trees to chop down, what to build, what to trade, what to plant, and for every thing there is a season (turn turn turn).  You're forced to deal with death, birth, attacks, sickness, madness, and a ton of other things that I have no idea are coming.  \n\nI keep thinking \"I could do better\" and I start a new game, but then I start to realize that no matter what I do, I'm never gonna have a perfect game, or a game where everything goes exactly according to plan.  I am eventually going to have to buckle down and stick to one game save to see it through.\n\nIf you're like me and starting something new holds a lot more interest than continuing an existing project (ADHD?) you may have difficulty with this game.  At the same time you may become so engrossed in it that you lose track of time and suddenly it's 6am and you wonder why you stayed up all night digging holes.  I'm starting to feel a bit of the madness myself.  (it's almost 4:30am as I write this)\n\nIn any case, it's probably not for everyone, but I'd say if you're unsure, find the non-steam version and try that, and if you can grok what's going on and it interests you, definitely buy this and support the developers... OR buy this and try to stay under the 2 hour refund  limit while you learn the basics (Good luck with that, it'll be 6 hours before you know what happened).  I believe this game is worth the money though (full price).  If you were going to wait for a sale you'd be waiting a long time anyway.  \n\nTL;DR If this looks interesting to you, don't wait! Buy now.  If you aren't sure, do a bit of research and come back and buy it.\n- Incomphrehesible UI, sloppy controls.\n\n\nGranted I'm a day one player, but very steep learning curve. Couldn't figure out interstellar nav, for the life of me, and the touchy controls made the dogfighting a chore. Save your money. This isn't a jump in and play game.\n- An interesting experience for RPGMaker vidya enthusiasts.\n\nBefore you pick up this title, be sure to download and play the demo, as the demo is the (free) first episode of the series, this game being the second episode.\n\nA Psychological Thriller, as stated in the description, is probably the best way to describe this series, an adventure through bizzare yet oddly pretty settings.\n\nThe first episode is quite a fun, humorous adventure, but still manages to be gripping and gut-wrenching in some areas. Difficult for me to describe in words, but it's free, so there's no reason not to play it.\n\nThe second episode strays from the fun, humorous side of things and focuses more on story, an unexpected yet completely welcome change of tone. If you enjoyed the first and got to like the characters, the second episode is well worth the price.\n\nFeel free to pick it up if it seems interesting to you.\n- [i]Welcome to MY Fantasy Zone[/i]\n\nPeople may look at Bayonetta’s design and dismiss it as something not worthy of their time, but the truth is that they are making disservice to themselves. Under the veil of constant innuendos, silly sexual posing, and pole dancing is the absolute peak of what the spectacle fighter genre has to offer, and the game delivers it [i]with style.[/i]\n\nBayonetta obviously does not take itself seriously. This absolute lack of consideration for the common sense eventually hurts the game’s story fragments which become more incomprehensible the more you look into them, but you are not here for the stupid story, right? You are here to kick some serious ass in this visceral antithesis of DOOM, where instead of gunning down hell spawn as masculine badass, you end up spanking heavenly messengers as no-less-badass lady… using her magical hair to do so. Other common scenes include: suplexing a giant angelic dragon, fighting on top of a fired war-missile, playing volleyball with set of huge demonic hands, or accidentally ending all the possible debates between astronomers in topic of Pluto being a planet (this one unfortunately will score you a Game Over screen so keep this in mind as a tip). The point is that Platinum delivers a game of stupidly and unapologetically over the top action that doesn't stop being awesome throughout its whole run.\n\nI’m also impressed with how deep the gameplay mechanics can go despite looking deceptively simple. This ties to the difficulty level of the game which is a tad too high when selecting Normal for the first time. You will miss important dodges, misjudge enemy attack cues, mash buttons instead of comboing, and your general understanding of the game will not be enough to scrape above the lowest skill ratings. Enemies get tougher and tougher and you will end up dying pretty often, all while still having jolly good fun, which in the end is really impressive. I will recommend to try the New Game+ mode after finishing the game, but still setting the difficulty to Normal. You will see yourself improving significantly and discovering more interesting tricks up Bayonetta’s sleeve. All of it is a very satisfying process that shows developers’ design forte and ensures the replayability.\n\nBattle system is the game’s biggest part and there aren’t that many more important gameplay mechanics to speak of. There is some basic exploration here and there, which is decent, and a few minigames played out throughout the campaign which are also adding up to the pile of positives I have for the game. Aside for the story and locations being copy-pasted between chapters quite often, I cannot really find any more faults that require special mention. There are the graphics which are a little aged all things considered, and the PC port that, while being quite good, has some minor quirks. Summarizing, there is nothing wrong that an [i]absolutely sexy[/i] soundtrack cannot fix with its joyful and jazzy tunes and impressive choral themes for the angelic enemies.\n\nYou like action games? Then shut up, buy a lollipop and sensually lick it while playing Bayonetta. You definitely will be looking stupid in the process, but on the brighter side of this flight to the moon – you will experience one of the best, if not THE BEST, games from the action genre.\n- I love this game. In fact, I've loved it since I was in highschool about 8 years ago. My friend and I used to play this game together all the time on my flashdrive. We were always discussing & trying to understand the ins-&-outs of the game and how to get a specific ending depending on what you did. Playing this brought me back to those good times in that library.\n\nThe OSTs are nostalgic, the gameplay is about the same and the artwork is amazing as ever(actually the graphics are much better with this remake).\nThe only complaint I have is that it lags at random times(though usually in the menu). The original IB on RPGMaker never did that.\nOverall I'm glad I bought this so I could support the Dev and thank them for all those years of entertainment-\nI just wish there wasn't so much lag over an RPGMaker game.\n- Honestly I've put over 400 hours into 20XX and this game is even better! Even though it's unfinished as of current it's still a fantastic time and truly stands out on it's own.\n- Before I start this review, I want to make something clear. This comes from a place not of hatred, but of love. Destiny is a game near and dear to my heart and it angers me to see the way Bungie has handled it. I know they can do better.\nI've played the Destiny series since year 1, Destiny 1. I've been through its highs, its lows, and everything inbetween this game I love. I've seen content droughts, content surges, content drops and flops. I've seen this game rise... and fall.\nIt's time I faced facts, I stop huffing Copium, and be truthful; despite being with this game for years, I genuinely can't recommend it to anybody. Not in the state the game is right now. This isn't just another user complaining about a there not being new content to play constantly without any droughts, but as a player genuinely concerned for the direction Bungie is taking the game, the way the past and recent DLC have been handled, how they've monetized this game, and how they've treated their veteran playerbase.\nI bought the $100 Special Edition back when this game first released. All that content I bought with my hard earned money. Within a year $100 worth of content turned free to play. $100 for me turned into $0 for the average player within one year. I received no compensation for buying the game so early except an Emblem. An emblem. Not a potential for a free season pass when the seasons first started, no refund for my money, nothing. Where is this content now? Gone. Not a piece of it is still in the game. My compensation for this content leaving? Nothing still.\nForsaken, the best DLC they've released for this game. The DLC that brought D2 from being a shitshow to being a great, relevant game with a good story tacked on it? Wiped from this game's code.\nThe game may be \"Free to play\" but you'll sink hundreds of dollars for DLC, seasonal passes, and now separate dungeon passes worth as much as your average season pass. It's too much money to ask for people that Bungie can and will wipe from the game's code in a few months time.\nYes, the content they do bring is fun, but drip-feeding us the same content for months without any relevant changes is just not a fun game to play. What is there to do anyways? We have:\nRaids, high quality but the same ones every time\nStrikes, fun but repetitive after years of getting so little new ones\nDungeons, similar problems to the above, fun but repetitive from lack of variety\nSeasonal content, not worth doing anything but the current season unless you're trying to follow up with the game story\nCrucible with a shitty tryhard meta and hardly any new maps\nGambit, a gamemode they've basically given up on with maps they've removed from the pool\nSeasonal events, fun but the same damn thing every season\nNone of these feel fresh after years and years of doing the same ones and watching old favorites get sunset from the game.\nAnd it's not like Bungie can't look back at D1 for inspiration; Sparrow Racing League is something players have been clamoring for, it'd be something fresh that Bungie can use to entice players to stay in the game. Bungie has gone on record stating that \"by the time they've designed an SRL map for Destiny 2, they could have made several strikes maps\" which to me states that A: they aren't willing to put in the effort for player experience and B: aren't willing to make several strike maps worth of content at once.\nAnd getting new players into Destiny? The most painful experience I've tried to do. This game's onboarding experience is horrible, mismanaged, and held back by half the content being locked behind a paywall. From friends I've tried to get into the game, the new player experience is:\nOverwhelming\nConfusing\nNo sense of clear direction\nAll the cool stuff is locked behind paid dlc\nWhy was I put into this random mission when I booted up the game (seasonal mission you start with at every season)\nAny many more comments that made them not want to play the game.\n\nI know this review was basically a rant about how I feel this game is going with no clear rime or reason, jumping from topic to topic, but I just want to see this game thrive the way I know it can. Because Bungie has shown to be a competent company with quality products, but I'm just not seeing that right now.\nAnd i also want compensation for the $100 I watched vanish in the span of a year.\n- I played the demo and instantly became enamored. The mix of Slay the Spire-style deck-building with elements of the ship combat from FTL: Faster Than Light is an absolutely fascinating mix, and the \"single-axis\" movement system adds a whole extra layer that I've never seen in anything except the Mega Man: Battle Network series.\n\nI bought the full game within the first hour of being available. After having played for nearly 4 hours at the time of writing, my opinion hasn't changed in the slightest. I already love what's available and so far I feel like I've barely scratched the surface.\n\nI can't wait to see what awaits in the future for this awesome title.\n\nEDIT: As a small addition, I will say: I beat my very first run, which is set to the lowest difficulty (Normal). I jumped up to Hard to try to unlock a new ship, and I haven't been able to beat a run since then. It's probably just that I'm bad, all things considered, but be aware that the changes made with difficulty increases are probably more impactful than they may seem.\n\nAlso I wanna say to the devs: thank you for launching the game with mod support and working on making it easier! But also please look into getting Steam Workshop support if you can!\n- Don't believe the hype.\n\nAbsolutely limited appeal and not Rouge-Lite/Like, shouldn't even be remotely labelled as such. Cult management and the building of your cult is very rudimentary and a massive missed opportunity. No strategy or tactics in combat (little to no variation in creatures) and ultra repetitive. Little to no option and interaction with followers of any substance besides the simple 101's. \n\nSo many better options out there (cheaper as well) that can offer you more and robust challenge (rim world, for eg).\n\nIf you must purchase, only do so at a extremely discounted rate. You'll regret it otherwise.\n\nCute graphics will only get you so far.\n\nDon't believe the hype.\n- I would give this a mixed rating if I could. \nThe story is told in such a boring way that it's hard to stay invested. You run to one person, listen to a cutscene, or more likely read a cutscene, than go to another person to talk to. Sometimes you fight one guy but mostly it's pretty dull. There is very little gameplay in the overland content and everything plays like a bad visual novel.\n\nAAR, the first MSQ is just one fetch quest after the other with little story in it. Oh there is some story there, but it's not great. The characters are shallow with few expectations, both the supporting cast and villains. \n\nHeavensward, the expansion I got through before my time ran out, is better than ARR but not that enjoyable. There were parts I like (not to give spoilers, it was the part where you go on a “journey”) Sadly, that part of the expansion was far too short. Than the story precedes to shove itself up it’s own ass as it becomes fixated on one part of the lore. [spoiler]I don’t give a damn how the war started! It was a thousand years ago.[/spoiler]\nPro:\n-If you like story, and only story, you will like this game.\n-A lot of content\n-Trial fights. (Good boss fights without the boring part of dungeons)\n\nCons:\n-Little in the way of gameplay outside of dungeons and trials \n-ARR is a slog and not worth reading. Skip as fast as you can and just watch a recap video.\n-dungeons are locked behind the story and not unlocked as you level up.\n-The story is on the lower end of other final fantasy games.\n-Lalafells are in the game. People who play this race are degenerates.\n- Simply fantastic. Probably the best TRUE RPG I've ever played. Your choices matter, dialogue options matter, the order in which you do things matter, even such small things such as the items you hold in your hand matter. Every build is viable, go heavy in Physical stats and you'll have difficulty solving things Logically, but maybe you can brute force your way through something. Go heavy in Logic and you'll be weak in a one-to-one fight, but maybe you'll be so fast to figure things out that it'll never come to that. You'll see things that the dim-witted brute with high Physical didn't. Failure is encouraged, there are many routes in the game you cannot open without failing something else first.\n\nA true combat system does not exist. At all. Physical altercations are decided through dice rolls based on how you've built your character. And virtually all of them are optional. I like this decision a lot. I've always found it immersion-breaking in RPGs when you're just running around the countryside, killing every bandit or animal that comes your way. This one keeps fights realistic with REAL consequences depending how things go.\n\nBarring having to restart my game once due to a bug (quicksave often, autosaves are few), the game had no major technical issues. There was a single point in the game where a vital skill check required a specific skill to be built, and I'm not sure if there were any alternate routes. I couldn't find any, just had to savescum the check. Aside from that, you have options as to how to approach everything. I'm not sure if that was an oversight or if I just missed something.\n\nCan't go into the story much without spoilers (and you DON'T want it spoiled, it's great.) But it's very well-written and even hilarious at some points. But don't be fooled, it's not a comedy game. It tackles very serious topics such as Fascism, Communism, Mental Illness, Addiction, and many other things.\n\nOverall an amazing RPG experience that I cannot recommend enough. Will definitely play through this several times to see how things go with different builds. Highly suggest you purchase this if you have any interest.\n- Red Matter 2 sets a new bar for VR mystery/suspense/story based games. I've thought about reaching out to the developer and thanking them it's that good. If you're a space lover like me, DON'T MISS THIS! Some very memorable moments in this, and the graphics are even better than Alyx sometimes. The music also is well done. Just enough to give you some atmosphere, but not overdone. If you also played the original this is worth getting for a continuation of the original story too. Very little is re-hashed so you've got to pay some attention to succeed. This also gets fairly creepy, more than the original, so if you're averse to horror games, this may not be for you. All in all, as I just finished this days ago, I'm still fairly blown away at how good it was. The developer has really found their niche. Still getting chills from the ending of this.\n- I would say that [i]Pyre[/i] is a rather underrated gem from [i]Supergiants[/i], although it has very positive reviews on Steam. I believe that many players missed an important info about [i]Pyre[/i]. It's a visual novel in the first place, heavily concentrated on lore, characters and story. The action in sports like battles is just a secondary element. I was also surprised by it being a visual novel, but I wasn't disappointed. Right on the contrary. I have fallen in love.\n\nThis game is very complex and everything in it has its purpose. There is a meaning to how the story unfolds, what exact information you learn, what characters you meet… maybe you won't be able to see it during your first playthrough, but the end should make it clear and eventually all the other playthroughs… because there is still a lot to see and I will come back many times for sure.\n\nI don't want to spoil you the story, because it's truly amazing and filled with plot twists which always force me to change my plan… I can say that we get exiled to the Downside, a horrid place without any means of returning, meant for the worst criminals, delinquents and offenders of the Commonwealth. There, on wide empty plains, we are found lost, alone and almost broken by a trio of other exiles, each one of them different in species, size, personality and with different motivation in their hearts. They make us an offer, because there is a way out of this place, although it's not commonly known… not that we can exactly decline as that would mean our, probably quick, demise in the Downside wilderness. We accept and offer them our skills then, namely reading as it was banned a long time ago in the Commonwealth, because only the Reader can uncover the secrets hidden in [i]the Book of Rite[/i]s… book that holds the information on how can one obtain their freedom… and even something more.\nWe board their old wagon, which had seen better times a lifetime ago, and following the stars we set on an adventure looking for other suitable exiles to be able to unite and to fight for a better future not just for us, but for all the others.\n\n[i]Rites[/i] are the action parts of the game. I would describe it as a mix of basketball and American football. There are three players on each side, the main goal is to grab a ball and toss it into enemy fire. Winner is the one who extinguishes the opponent's fire first. Fights are short, fast paced and if you are not careful you can lose in a blink of an eye (especially on a harder difficulty). As you progress through the story you recruit new characters into your “squad\", each have a different cast of abilities and more importantly also behave completely differently on the field. You are always given an opportunity to try them out, but it can be a challenge to master them properly. The ones who participate in the fight gain enlightenment (a lot of experience), those who are on the bench gain inspiration (next time they participate in the fight they level up faster). And here comes the catch. The ultimate goal is to get free, but only one can leave this place once he is deemed worthy and [b]you[/b] are going to choose which one it is, from the three most enlightened. [b]You[/b] will send away one of your exiles, never to return. So the one you play most with, your best one will be gone and you [b]have[/b] to play with the others… never forget that.\nThis concept adds another level of immersion, because you are now torn apart by the choice waiting for you. Will you allow them freedom or will you deny it? But you and your crew aren't the only one seeking their freedom, there are others you have to fight with and yet again they all have different desires and motivations to go back. Nothing is easy and maybe sacrificing your own freedom to offer them chance for their own may be the stars will.\n\nThe cast of the characters you meet in the game is big and pretty diverse. Their personalities are excellently portrayed and all of them are very much likable, some of them have written deeply into my heart. There is no standard voice acting as no one is speaking in English, except for [i]The Voice[/i] (tiptop Logan Cunningham), instead they have an \"extra new\" language. And they only speak in short lines, few words, sights… but that's all you need. It's so amazing, it fits the characters so much. I wouldn't want it any other way. You can also open info about all of the characters in the game, learn about their past… and in the end even about their future.\n\nIn addition to a great story and characters we have bright, vivid, colorful graphics full of tiny details, it's a joy to look at. Next thing that is creating a great fitting atmosphere throughout the whole game is the soundtrack, which is exceptional! Darren Korb is truly ingenious. His music is full of emotions and perfectly captures every situation and character. I really like the soundtrack in [i]Alan Wake[/i], especially the songs which tell the story plot, I have found it very clever. Darren Korb, and the [i]Supergiants[/i], simply brought it to perfection, because their storytelling songs bring me goosebumps every time I hear them.\n\nAs is usual with other [i]Supergiants[/i] games each character has a skill challenge, which will grant you artifact designed right for them. You can also make fights harder by enabling disadvantages against yourself in the form of better stats for your adversaries and worse stats for your triumvirate. After completing the main story you can test your skills against others in multiplayer or just against a CPU, that's also fun.\n\nI can wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who loves great compelling stories with beautiful visuals and soundtrack; you won't be disappointed. Be prepared that you are going to read, do not skip or rush through it, the story is the important thing, not the action.\nThere is only one thing I find unsatisfactory about the game - I would love to be able to romance one of the characters. ^^\n- Really need a report button to slap some senses into trolls in online matches.\nCan't even escape them at ranked. sigh\nGreat game nonetheless, 4/5\n- SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT.\n\nAs the store page states, NOREN is supposedly a 'simple' keyfinding game. That would be true if there were any keys actually in the game, but as it stands it seems that NOREN is a simple abandoned shovelware game that's impossible to progress in, let alone beat. You play as some soldier in a massive, dark castle, equipped only with a dying lantern. The light fades quickly, and you can regain light slowly by... standing by a light source. That'd be simple enough if you weren't endlessly pursued by dinosaurs that are programmed with AI which knows your exact location at all times; three chomps and you're 'aparted' from the world, where you respawn with whatever amount of light and sanity you have left. Additionally, the translation attempt is abysmal at best. \n\nBoth NOREN and its developer, ThroneLab, should be banned from Steam. I do not blow the 'scam' whistle lightly, and I only do such when I am 100% certain of something actually being a scam. There are a handful of videos of this title on YouTube as well, with only one being over 5 minutes long. No one found a key. If evidence can be presented to me that there is in fact a way to progress in this game, I will rewrite this review. Until then, beware and stay vigilant.\n\n[h1]Rating: [b]0.0/5.0[/b] - WARNING. Scam developer. Abandon all hope, ye who enter.[/h1]\nThe Horror Network [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28221963/]Curator[/url] | [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thehorrornetwork]Group[/url] Click for Gore\n- Like Path of Exiles, except not as 'Press-One-Button-Combat' like. You actually occasionally use more than one button, believe it or not POE fans.\nIn all seriousness I played like 5 hours of POE using nothing but a throwing dagger move, and it worked, including against bosses. Grim Dawn at least makes it clear that basic attacks do in fact exist. Later on it stars to get a little bit, a LITTLE BIT, POE-like, but even so, I give it a 7/10 minimum.\n- ✔ Procedurally generated levels (some are not)\n✔ Neat graphics and animations\n✔ Good sound design\n✔ Solid and gratifying game mechanics \n✔ Well-balanced difficulty curve\n✔ Linux support!\n\n✘ No DRM-free build (yet?)\n✘ No user-generated content (no level editor)\n\nRuns surprisingly well on very low-end specs computer (under Linux too!).\nAn excellent turned-based action strategy game. Very polished and entertaining!\nYet one more proof that Swedish developers are among the best on this planet.\n- [h1] Risk of rain 2 is the kind of roguelike where you wanna have just one more quick run before bed but end up playing till dawn. [/h1]\n\n[b] Visuals: [/b] \nThe art style is easy on the eyes early on, but as the run continues and your screen starts to fill with clutter, the diarrhoea christmas lights at later stages can be seizure inducing.\n\n[b] Story and Setting: [/b] \nRoR2 doesn’t hold hands and guide you through its story because honestly there is not much story going on here. There is rich lore to explore for people who want to.\n\n[b] Music: [/b] \nThe lo-fi melody perfectly fits the perilous environment and matches the gameplay with synced rhythm and tempo. Sound design is good too.\n\n[b] Gameplay and progression: [/b]\nDrop into a planet, kill monsters, get money, buy items. Rinse and repeat until you become powerful to one shot God himself. Fast paced with constant running, jumping, sliding and juggling between primary weapon, secondary weapon, abilities and equipment. In each run the difficulty increases over time, which is an innovative approach to deal with difficulty. The roster is filled with unique characters who each have their own gameplay mechanics, making the game feel completely different. \nMost items can be obtained by completing specific challenges. You can also unlock game modifiers to make the game easier or more difficult to your liking. The challenges are one-of-a-kind, and the rewards are meaningful enough to keep players interested.\n\n[b] Game time: [/b]\nThere is no limit. It stops being fun when you decide so.\n\n[b] Online: [/b]\nThere is co-op to enjoy with friends and difficulty scales with the number of players. And if you have no friends, rest assured because all achievements are attainable through single player.\n\n[b] Bugs: [/b]\nNo bugs or technical issues.\n\n[b] PC Requirement: [/b] \nWithout a decently powerful PC the game faces severe lags and occasional crashes in long runs where you loop multiple times and a million things are happening in the background. Lowering graphical settings can help to an extent.\n\n[b] DLC: [/b]\nSurvivors of the Void DLC adds excellent new characters, stages, items,  enemies and alternate endings.\n\n[b] Price: [/b]\nWorth every penny.\n\n[b] My only problem with the game is it doesn’t have a save system. Once you start a run, you will have to see it through to the end. I want to be able to stop at any stage and continue from there later on. I don’t always have hours required to do multiple loops in one sitting. Although there is a mod for saving, I would love a native option. [/b]\n\n[b] Rating: [/b] \nThe Devs are continuously supporting and updating the game which is commendable. The community is very active and you can add tons of community made [b] mods [/b] to breathe new life into your game. \nI highly recommend it. [b] 10/10 [/b]\n- 3 things:\n\n-Flatten land\n\n-Click citadel to get warriors\n\n-Click warriors at their warriors\n\nGood job, you've just mastered the entire game.\n\nThe game includes such crazy moments as:\n\n-Flattening land\n\n-Seeing the enemy flatten land\n\n-flattening your land faster\n\n-Clicking trees and rocks since your workers can't do shit\n\n-Clicking your warriors into their town\n\n-Watching your warriors fight their warriors\n\n-Accidentliy Alt+Tabing and having the game get stuck in windowed mode\n\n10/10 Would trust Peter Moloneux and be dissapointed again... apparently.\n\nProtip, send this to someone that loves you and watch them try to pretend that they enjoy it.\n- I hated Undertale.\n\nIt was, pretty clearly, a game about sexy skeletons. I did not care about sexy skeletons. I refused to play a game about sexy skeletons.\n\nThen my friend made me listen to the soundtrack, and I decided I could deal with a few hours of sexy skeletons if I got to listen to the best video game music I had ever heard while doing it. \n\nI played Undertale. It's not a game about sexy skeletons. It's a game about choices, maybe, or morality, or curiosity. It's a game about pushing the limits. It's a game about experiences, about \"what would happen if I did this?\", about storytelling so intricate and complex and raw that it shouldn't be able to fit into seven hours of bullet hell and pixel graphics. But, somehow, it does. Every choice you make has an impact. Every object you check has a story. The soundtrack, the witty yet profound writing, the simple pixel graphics, and even the menu screens and bullet patterns themselves all intertwine in order to tell a story that only you decide the ending of.\n\nAlso, the skeletons aren't even sexy.\n\nMy advice to you: Go in as blind as you can. Don't read walkthroughs. Don't watch playthroughs. Don't prepare yourself. Don't even look at overviews. Hell, don't even read the Steam page description. Just buy the game (and give some well-earned money to a little white dog), and, as it were, climb the mountain yourself. Don't let anyone backseat. Don't listen to people who tell you there's a right way to play.\n\nAnd when you think you've reached the end, just think--what other choices could you have made?\n\nSo, yes. I hated Undertale.\n\nAnd then I played it.\n- Black Mesa is a fantastic remake of the Original Valve classic and one of the greatest of all time video games, Half-Life.  This sci-fi classic FPS has you take on what might seem like a hum-drum day in the life of an experimental physicist, but things go quite off rails when experimenting with a strange material sample from an even stranger dude in a suit. \n\nAfter a while (and shooting a lot of aliens and bashing their heads in with a crowbar) you'll save the world... but now Black Mesa lets you do this with dramatically updated graphics, 4K support and a plethora of visual tweaks so you can rest assured this will run great on any gaming rig. \n\nA must have for big fans of Half-Life or gamers who are new to the scene and never got to play the original.   When on sale, of course!\n- My profile pic is the reaction i have towards the game devs that made this game.\nVisually disgusting, gameplay wise impossible and over all terrible.\nWhile it's possible to beat it and get all the achievements it's difficult and also the space level is actually visual aids it's so disgusting to look at that you can't even focus on the gameplay.\nNot worth it even for free which is how i probably got it i can't remember and i don't want to...\n- Complete scam - game barely works. Devs got it to load with stability and then dropped all funding and support for the game. Complete contract violation with Steam. I actually cant believe it is still in the Steam store. DO NOT BUY !!! I was not allowed to refund it even with only .4 hours played, due to \"management issues\" within Double Fine. I am guessing Steam cant get their money out of them either.\n- It is a very good game, some people complain about how there are no checkpoints in levels, but fear not, as they can all be beaten in a couple of minutes, and some people complain about how its repetitive because you need to do everything over and over if you keep dying, but if that happens, its clear you are missing something, so by heading to the IEYTD website, you can see tips for every level (secrets are not included, only how to beat the level itself), and if the tips dont help, after 2 tips you can just choose to reveal the answer, so those negative reviews are no reason to not buy this amazing game, this is the game trilogy i recommend every VR player to play ATLEAST once\n- I left home with nothing but a needle and my granny's briefcase full o' snakes, hitched a ride to Boring Springs, killed two men and three snakes, learned to speak Goblin, and befriended a woman whose home was burned to the ground by a gang of cows. Then I bought a horse and left the tutorial area, and things got weird. I'm pretty on board with this one.\n- If 'Baba is You' and 'The Witness' are the puzzle game equivalents to a full-course meal, then Patrick's Parabox is a fluffy dessert that you just can't put down. It's full of bite-sized puzzles that rarely repeat themselves, instead iterating and expanding upon each other as you learn all of the tricks and mechanics the game has to offer. A delight to the very last bite.\n\nIf you're looking to be challenged then there's plenty of that too, but not as much as you'd find in a typical sokobon game. With that said there [i]is[/i] some Level Editor support so the potentials there for dastardly custom levels ;P\n- Graphics of Quake, atmosphere of Blood, brutality of Doom, some weapons of Hexen/Heretic, drunkenness and trashiness of Redneck Rampage, and some weird quirkiness from Half-Life  = GOTY\n- Heartbound is a fantastic indie game with a lot of heart and fantastical mysteries.\nIf you enjoy beautiful 2D gaming experiences this is the game for you! \n\nPlay as a young boy on his journey to find his doggo, Baron. \nYou will explore various, unique worlds on this journey each with mysteries of their own...\n\nThe music I must draw particular attention to: It is wonderful to listen to. Honestly do yourself a favour and pick up this game- it is still in development but you will be glad to know that the updates are (thankfully) free!\n\nGive this game the love and attention it deserves!\n- Noita is a great indie rogue-lite 2D adventure where every pixel has his own life. The controls with mouse and keyboard are simple and the principle of the game as well easy to learn (and hard to master). Just get as deep, as far as possible. You only have one life. If you die you start all over. \n\nGameplay video: https://youtu.be/6N4Boz1YA2Y\n\nI very much enjoy playing Noita, even if it is sometimes a bit unfair and the procedural generated levels aren't always giving you the same amount of luck. The game still needs some more balance in the gameplay, as well as optimizations since I experienced little stutters here and there.\n\nSince it is early access, I expects improvements in this sense. Overall the game is fun and definitely an added-value to every indie library or rogue-lite gamers collection.\n\nTherefore, I can recommend the game! \n\nPS: Restarting a run shouldn*t restart the application, @developers.\n- This one of the best first person shooter games I've ever played, plain and simple.\n\nHalf Life 2 begins 20 years after the original Half Life. As Gordon Freeman awakens from stasis he finds himself on a train heading to City 17 which is overrun by the combine. You find yourself as the leader of the resistance and you must take down the Combine. \n\nHalf Life 2 is at this point one of the best received games and I'm sure pretty much everyone has played it. If not well what the hell are you doing reading this review ? You need to go buy this game straight away and play it right now.\n\nThe game is a simple first person shooter, but it does plenty things different than the regular first person shooters. You have a health bar and you have to do platforming to solve some of the puzzles.  Not to mention the source engine physics are absolutely insane. \n\nFor a game that came out back in 2004 it still looks amazing. Now while it does have so low res textures it's still looks breath taking, like in the final chapters.\n\nThe game for the most part is pretty easy. I played through the game without a problem, even though some segments were tough due to the fast movement you have to pull off to avoid gunfire. Not to mention the Strider battles are incredibly intense and quite difficult.\n\nThe game took me 10 hours to finish. I felt this was the perfect amount of time for the price I paid for it and this was worth every single penny.\n\nApart from the single playthrough there's not much replay value. The only reason to replay it twice is to look for the G-Man Easter eggs. \n\nIn the end Half Life 2 is a fantastic game. It's a must own for everyone who is a gamer. This game is a piece of history and without a doubt one of the best games I have ever played in my entire life.\n\nI experienced zero problems while playing the game. I ran the game on ultra settings 60 FPS the entire time of playing. This game runs really well and should run on pretty much all systems.\n\nFinal Rating:\n9.5/10 -  A Must own and must play\n\nIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments what you disliked about the review.\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/snortsreviews#curation]here[/url] - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!\n- DLC and Bugs prove this company is Garbage.\n- 11 Jun 2023 Purchased the game again.  The weird distorted things are significantly reduced. The flight physics are improved. There are many mods and payware add-ons available. This is an excellent game for pilotage. There is a huge well mannered diverse community and the use of YourControls allows for a decent shared cock-pit experience.\n\nI recommend buying this game for the serious flight simmer.\n\n\n22 Jan 2021 Stunning graphics. mostly, with some really weird distorted things.   This is a very interesting game for those who are not very focused on real world aviation.  The airports are not accurately represented and the aircraft do not respond realistically, unless you are not interested in detail.   I think that it is an interesting product for casual entertainment, but serious flight enthusiasts will likely be disappointed.  I expect that with time users will create mods (aircraft and airports) to repair the inaccuracies, and fix the lack of detail, but I doubt that the weird graphics will ever be fixed.\n- SUPER MARIO!......\nsorry  not really :P\nits a platform game yes but nothing like mario\nyou can spend a lot of time in this game and still not master it\nthis is a game thats really good for platform gamers that gt to goodfor mario games\nand a punisher for those who are nt that good in those types of games \nit has lots of humor ad moments that will want to eat yoer fingernaisl to the bones\ni say hell yeah to this game even do it got me mad a few times\n- Lots of people parrot the \"tech demo\" or \"benchmark of the singularity\" lines without forming their own opinions.\n\nMe personally, as a fan of Supreme Commander, I enjoyed this game more then I thought I would. I only played the single player campaigns and haven't touched multiplayer. \n\nThe gameplay is exactly what it should be for this kind of game. When I first saw this game I didn't like how every unit was a hovering unit, but it makes sense with the class system the game has. Frigates are basically infantry, Cruisers are tanks, Dreadnauts are hero/high tier. The game borrows from Dawn of War with the territory control mechanic.\n- 5 game difficultys Easy Normal Nemesis Gravewalker Brutal... so whitch one im supposed to play for it to be like the first game(which dident have a difficulkty, jst like awesome games like Gta 4 and assassins creed)???

This is gonna be a long post, I've nolifed the shit out of this game for the better part of half a decade so there's a bit.\n\nHaving people come into my streams & DMs to ask me if I'm going to be porting my map and mods over to ARK1.5 with ASA and then to ARK2 before all of this immense drama and fleecing happened, before we knew anything about prices and release dates- it was a firm yes! I'd love to bring my creations over to UE5, porting content over was so easy, even myself and people in the modding community were putting our maps and creations into stock UE5 just to see what the possibilities were and get off on the new physics, lumen and nanite.\n\nNow I really don't want to bring that content over. Not only because of the bad business practice, with many other games who have ported over to UE5 or have done engine upgrades been offered for free- but because I've seen this one too many times with this company and the business is just horrifically mismanaged and it's heartbreaking for some of us, it's heartbreaking for me.\n\nWhen someone in a position of power and authority over an IP and business has stated that ARK1.5 would be free, as a gesture of good faith, you take that as a promise, and we were all stoked about that. That was the right thing to do. ARK is not a small indie, unknown survival game in a (mostly) unfinished state anymore like it was- it is a powerhouse in the industry, top survival game charts across the internet for -years- will have ARK in the top 5- it is not a game that has done poorly for revenue, publicity or players. It is one of the giants. The best IP that Snail/WC have to date and continues to be. There is no reason to renege on a promise that was publicly made. And before some moron says \"JuSt DoNt BuY It ThEn\" it's deeper than that, I would have had, at my hours invested, zero issues purchasing ARK1.5 for like $20-$30 bucks with all DLC's included- but to make an offer, after it was promised as free, then to take it back and serve up an even bigger steaming pile of shit that is more expensive on a plate, and for Wildcard to hand you the spoon and be like yum yum dig in! Is so strange.\n\nHonestly, I'm not surprised. I was a public moderator in the ATLAS discord with Jat and other off branched former/current- Wildcard/Grapeshot employees at the release of that absolute dumpsterfire and was there with the rest trying to put out fires that could be witnessed from fu**g Jupiter- because I had faith and volunteered my time to assist with a company I believed in, created for and wanted to succeed so badly for the community. \n\nDark and Light was next. Another abandoned IP. Then Last Oasis- yep- Abandoned. All of the offbranches of ARK have failed so horribly, and haven't managed to capture that excitement that ARK did for the industry but they will absolutely keep trying to push out what they think consumers will like, all without listening to any feedback- and feedback isn't always good, do not get it twisted some suggestions I've seen truly are horrendous- but there are gems in amongst the boulders and landslides. Having the initiative to sift and find them, and then really look at them seems to be the problem. It concerns me deeply when Wildcard state themselves on their newsletters that ARK2 will be such a different experience from ARK1 that it now makes sense why they tried to package it in a non-refundable-at-time-of-play bundle with ARK1.5.\n\nSpeaking from experience here- the best thing Wildcard/Snail have done for ARK, and I will never discredit them for it, is their Sponsored Mods program and hiring modders from the community for ARK and ATLAS. That alone has kept ARK where it is, as popular as it is, as fresh as it is and as revolutionary as it is. There is never a drought of \"content\" with ARK, as the modding community carries it on their backs each and every day. Official servers have their place, and I disagree with how they're being handled, but have no solution for that as I never was an official player for more than an hour at a time to remind me why I prefer modded servers. This is no discredit to the ARK art department, by the way, having looked through the maps in the Devkit- Aberration is still to this day is a visual and technical marvel, and many other maps made since then.\n\nThere is a massive air of uncertainty for modders with ARK1.5 and 2. Logistically, the average number of mods on big unofficial servers is about 18- if each modder listing them on Overwolf decides to list their single mod for say $3 bucks, something very reasonable- times that by 18 and are players really going to be expected to play on a single server they MIGHT not even like, for $54 bucks? Maybe they discovered that server was good but had no players during their playtime- and then they find one in their region but, oh- there's 5 more mods on this server, there's another $15 to play on this one. Is a $69(nice) investment really worth it? I don't think so. Even at what has been discussed quietly behind closed doors with other modders at a $1 a mod price, so 50c to the modder, 50c to Overwolf/Wildcard- that's still, on average, $18 bucks to play on a server- this price is not including ARK1.5, or the DLCs for it- so what was the discussed \"Content creators/Modders can make a living!\" price...? Because when you take a step back from the buzzwords, there's a colossal black hole of a problem in the logistics.\n\nI digress, without any more information to go on regarding priced mods, we can only speculate. Back to what we know. \n\nSelling all DLCs and base game for ARK 1 that will functionally become a single player story mode and mod carried game without any warnings, notices or heads up to new prospective players is scummy as hell. There will absolutely be more delays before ARK 1.5, which will extend the lifecycle of the current game and DLCs, sure, but it's shady. The idea that ARK1 will become, in a sense, a showcase of my above statement about modders carrying the entire ARK community on their backs, and a solo story is fine- but adjust your listings so that people will know they will never experience ARK1 as \"Wilcard intended\" with the removal of official servers, that they will be playing with archived mods no longer receiving updates as many modders move over to 1.5, that they will have a limited playerbase to play with as most have gone to 1.5, that there is limited updates going to be provided due to 1.5- that there is no more official DLC... due to 1.5.\n\nThis isn't even taking into their account their roadmap of the supposed finished content releases for ARK1.5 and ARK2 finishing up and starting at almost the exact same time. So we will have this problem ALL over again when the release of ARK2 is imminent, after it's delays. Players who bought ARK1.5 and all the DLC's will play on that for a month or two before ARK2 is released, then ARK1 is even more abandoned, and ARK1.5 will dwindle.\n\nI know many people will say- damn, this chick gives way too much of a shit about this game, you right lol. I don't like seeing a community be lied to, deceived, fleeced and taken advantage of. ARK is one of those \"coping\" games. If you spend any time with the community, it's a comfort. People come home from work or school and they will turn their brain off and just play. For hours. Not giving any thoughts to how shit their workday was, how badly they were bullied at school, how much anxiety they have or problems they are facing- ARK lets them turn off and have fun, it's an escape game. There's not many other games out there that keep people playing like ARK does, for so many reasons. But, the community is at the core of it.\n\nI wish Wildcard would pay attention to it.\n- Very fun game if you are looking for a cozy relaxing farming sim. if you had a hard time with the fishing mechanic in stardew valley then you will have an easier time with this game, ontop of that there are lots of cute little rhythm games to play and the animal raising is alot more in depth then stardew. just a little note of warning to new players, the game doesn't make this very clear but you shouldn't spend too much time gardening in your first year. Automatic watering systems aren't available until later on and if you are like me you will think making the biggest profit possible year one is a great idea but I accidentally ended up upgrading/unlocking everything except irrigation in my first year and now do not have much to spend my currency on. Other then finishing catching every fish, maybe decorating my farm/the village and getting the rare coloured animals theres not much else to do in the game for late game content. It feels like there is the intention of possibly adding more content later on? either way if you decide to play, for your first play through I really recommend exploring first and getting to know the villagers before you start large scale farming.\n- This game surprised me in how good it was. I had heard about it, like everyone, and also like a lot of people I had dismissed it as a watered-down Dark Souls clone with a Star Wars skin, and let it collect dust in my Steam collection.\n\nI was wrong. The game's combat is tight and polished, just the right difficulty on Normal. The movement, the general game feel, is superb. The game has a competent story with excellent characterizations, character arcs, dialogue, exposition, world-building, and pacing.  The music feels like top-shelf Star Wars without being a lazy copypasta of John Williams's score (though you'll hear sprinklings of familiar motifs throughout, of course). \n\nThere are collectibles (they are all cosmetics), but it's a tasteful, reasonable amount of them, and they are distributed in a way that feels fun instead of like a chore, and you're never pressured into collecting them with menus or reminders; they are entirely optional in both a technical and a psychological sense. I actually found it fun to collect new appearances in order to play dress-up \"Fashion Souls\". \n\nThere are bosses, and they are challenging but not frustrating. Definitely easier than Dark Souls's harder bosses like Ornstein or Artorias, but still tricky enough that it feels rewarding to overcome them.\n\nIf I had to describe this game in two words, it would be \"just right\". There is just the right amount of each little element that it feels fun, never tedious, never like a grind. I'm a jaded old man who has seen it all and who is not easy to entertain, and I found this game extremely refreshing. If you read this review during the sale where it's only 3.99 USD, get it immediately.\n- I'm going to write an honest review for this game since A LOT of people seem to be very biased.\n\nThis is not a perfect game. No 2K basketball game will ever be a perfect game. Does that mean this game is bad? No. Should you hold off on the game for now? Probably.\n\nLet's start with the positives:\n\n- A lot of people seem to gloss over the fact that 2K rehauled a lot of mechanics for this game. Shot meters feel more legitimate, this game is MUCH much more realistic (fouls, shot tendencies, etc...) This game is better and more fluid to control, and the gameplay reflects each players' ratings (defense, shots, etc...) much more accurately.\n\n- Online play seems to be better and more fluid. I've yet to encounter any latency issues online with quick play and the such.\n\n- MyCareer is MUCH better than last years. There is no cheesy story and the cutscenes feel much more integrated into the game. Orange Juice and dynamic duos are a great idea in general. The UI for MyCareer (and the game in general) is so much cleaner and more functional.\n\n- The game is visually beautiful, not much else to say on the matter.\n\nNow, the cons:\n\n- Help defense is broken. It's quite ridiculous that 2K hasn't fixes this lingering issue in such a long time but it's still there. This is a BIG issue in MyCareer and not quite as bad in other modes since you can manually control players.\n\n- Stat allocation is broken. This is a huge issue in MyCareer and has deterred me from playing the mode any more until 2K fixes this issue. Introducing the idea of stats that can only be raised in practice is actually quite a neat idea. However, these boosts are not permanent, even though 2K has stated they are. This is detrimental and demoralizing and discourages players from playing the game more. Limit caps are ridiculously strict as well. 2K NEEDS to fix these issues ASAP.\n\n- Numerous glitches.\n\n- 2K introduced broken mechanics along with the good mechanics. Ankle breakers are now pathetically easy to pull off (using Stephen Curry behind the back moves is a surefire way to have your defender fall). Moving screens are now a thing. \n\nI would hold off on buying this game until 2K patches it. There are just too many issues with the game that prevent it from being a playable game. I like this game. I really do. That's why I'm hoping 2K listens to the community and starts working on the issues at hand immediately.\n- Some of the tightest controls, buttery smooth animation and gorgeous scenes you'll see all year. I've bought it three times now, (once for me, twice as gifts for friends) and each time was worth it.\n\nSupport developers like these.\n- Project Kat is a really well polished and fleshed out indie RPG horror game, with tons of cool minor options to make which lead to different endings (there's at least 8), [strike]cuteanimegirls[/strike] likeable characters and a great story to add up to it, despite the Prologue being relatively short. The Steam version of the game offers much more than itch.io does, and both are free, making the game worthy of replaying once again if you have (or haven't) played the itch.io version a while back. Excited to play and see the future chapters soon!\n- There is no skill requirement to play this game; everything seems pretty randomized including when and where the demon attacks you. Its rather difficult to play alone or just with two players. So if your looking for a game to play alone for a fright or just with one other buddy of yours. Make sure your ready to lose, This game has a great concept I just hope it will get more refined with the attacks. It seems like you get killed before you can even attempt to complete the objective.\n- old but gold <3\n- Steam keeps on bothering me to write a review for this game so here's one , i guess.\n\nYou might have heard this ' there's nothing like it on the market ' description of Hunt : Showdown and frankly i must admit that it is mostly spot on. This game is pretty unique and intriguing mix of PVE and PVP within setting which i frankly doubt i ever really saw used in a video game before. We are talking about end of 19th century Louisiana  mixed with paranormal horror activity.\n\nIf you would take a super brief look at Hunt's gameplay loop one could mistakenly assume that it is a battle royal game and while there are few similarities between the two, Hunt has a really original and unique gameplay loop i have never seen done before in a video game.\n\nCore idea here is that you enter a map , which is 1km x 1km square , either alone , in a duo or a trio of hunters and your main goal is to look for clues to locate a boss , kill him , banish him and extract with a bounty. Sounds simple enough , right? But that is there fun actually behinds. Besides having to contend with PVE part of the game , that is various kind of AI controlled zombies ( for the lack of better word ) , number of sound traps like injured animals ,crows ,caged chickens and dogs ( of whom all make loud noises then disturbed in turn giving out your location and even direction you are moving in ) , you are also not alone in a pursuit of that bounty. That is there PVP part of game kicks in .\n\nEven  though this is  PVPVE game , PVE is here only to slow down you rather than being a real threat. Real threat comes from other players who also have same goal as you. Real 'meat' of this game is PVP and while you can choose and avoid PVP all together , you will not have much fun while doing so. Bosses , again , are mostly there to funnel players into the same area to initiate PVP fights.\n\nPVP is rough and tough in Hunt. From what i understand earlier in it's life it was even more hardcore , but even at it's current state this game is not for faint hearted folks. Kill times are low , weapons are mostly single shots so each shot counts ( fitting the settings and time period ) and while on a surface this could look like a simple point and shoot situation there are dozens upon dozens of systems and things to consider in each firefight so you will need tens and in some cases hundreds of hours to really start to feel what are you doing. \n\n I wont lie to you , for first 20 or 30 hours i was pretty much cowering behind stuff in each firefights in essence being a glorified decoy for enemy players while my team mate hopefully was doing something less useless.  Hunt can be really stressful with steep learning curve, perma death ( losing your hunter with all his/her equipment you spent so much money on ) and never knowing who has your in their scopes while crossing open fields but it also can be so very rewarding when you survive a final server wide gunfight on your last bullet and out of healing items. Even 140 hours in some of the firefights leaves me with my heart pounding which is a rare occasion after playing video games and FPS game for more than 25 years now.\n\nThere are of course bunch of technical issues, questionable decisions from the dev team and other negatives associated with any competitive online game so be aware of that before you decide to enter Bayou .\n- solid proof that the story could be the absolute worst garbage imaginable but if the gameplay rules, it literally wont matter. the gameplay in this is bomb-diggity.\n- I was warned a while back not to buy this game because of microtransactions, so I stuck with BTD5 instead. I haven't played much bloons before other than a lot of BTD 3 and 4 back then, but man I was missing out. The microtransactions in this game are nowhere near as bad as people made them out to be. Currently having too much fun with this game.\n- Dear Dev, \nI love this game, if you're reading reviews, please consider some ideas to make it better:\n-  Level designing: Add more ways to choose, and different endings. Right now SoR4 is flat from A to B, it made me feel down compare to SoR3.\n- Alternate customs, and playable same characters: Floyd is overrated and all my friends want to pick him. Make a game with 4 Floyds running sound fun. Use lifetime score to unlock customs.\n- 2v2 Battle! WHY NOT?\n- Shiva (new), Max (new), Roo, Estel (Badass Woman Cop)\n- Steam trading cards: I know it's not importance, but who doesnt want some badass backgrounds on steam profile?\n- Okay so first and foremost the reason why I'm giving this a thumbs up is simple. The game does what it set out to do perfectly. Because of that I have no complaints about it's style.\n\nHOWEVER.\n\nI personally do not like the game. It is my own personal hangup. But I can understand why other people will enjoy it.\n\nThe game is fast paced, level by level FPS with challenges. Almost every single one of them is timed if not all of them are timed. It's similar to Doom or Killing Floor. Only there are no cusomizations implemented at time of play. \n\nThe game is challenging and offers you many different faucets on those challenges. It has different gun types for different enemies, different strategies and all of them complicated and challenging. But that's the point right?\n\nRegardless, the game was pretty fun and if you're looking for a level by level challenge system set to a similar style of Doom then you might just enjoy this game.\n\nIf this wasn't enough for you then please check out the video on my YouTube Channel for a more precise in depth explanation (link below).\n\nThanks for reading and I hope I helped some of you out there to spend your money wisely.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXiok7bhPdY\n- I like furry art, but first and foremost im a RPG gamer, and as such I will rend judgment impartially. \n\nThe story is not bad, but still falls in the average category and it is predictable, gameplay is the same as the first Fuga (I have no problems there) but there are few new enemies,  so the strategy to beat the regular battles is very repetitive. My biggest complain remains the same since Tail Concerto and it is the dificulty... which is way too easy, there is no hard / nightmare mode for veteran players, Im not asking to die repeatedly like in dark souls but Cyberconnect2 needs to understand some players like a challenge in their games.\n\nMusic is ok and Hack is the best character of the lot (Tah tah tah tah  taaah!!!!!) I would play Fuga 3 just for him.\n\nIt pains me to give the thumbs down, but Cyberconnect2 needs to work a little harder.\n- *selects waifu*\n*waifu dies*\n*selects next waifu*\n*next waifu dies*\n*select husbando*\n*husbando dies*\n\nI LOVE THIS GAME!\n- EDIT:\n\nWhile I have played Squad quite a bit for a few years, the large update named \"V6.0 Infantry Combat Overhaul\" unfortunately did not sit well with me.\n\nThe goals for the update:\n\n- Increase length of fights.\n- Reduce the impact of lone wolfs (solo players).\n- Increase emphasis on teamwork mechanics, which mainly meant supression.\n- Increase gunplay diversity, to create choices between optics, since the old meta meant that the magnified optics were greatly outperforming iron sights and holo sights.\n\nWhile I do not disagree with some of the goals, the implementation of them left a lot to be desired.\n\nAfter the update most gunfights became a mess of supression, without either side being able to effetively kill each other beyond 200m.\nGunhandling was also drastically nerfed, creating the sense that your character has never held a rifle before, or even used an optic for that matter.\n\nI can unfortunately no longer recommend this game, since I myself no longer feel drawn to play it.\n\nIf enough changes are made, I may revisit the game and this review, but for now there are better options out there.\n\n\n** OLD REVIEW ** \n\nCan the game be amazing and fun - yes! Do I recommend this for everyone? - No.\n\nThe experience of the game largely depends on what servers / communities you play with. If you play the core game with no moderation (no rules or admins), the game will become a race to make the first unit and lock others out and a race to get armor, then proceed to rush the enemy and end up spawnkilling them near their main spawn.\n\nIf you play on moderated servers with established rules and active admins, then you may experience a great sense of teamplay - other times not so much.\n\nBefore you buy it though...\n\n- Microphone and willingness to use it is REQUIRED for a good experience (People will quickly kick or become hostile towards you, if you do not communicate)\n- This is not battlefield or call of duty, running of solo to pull off 360 noscopes will probably get you kicked/ killed.\n- You will die without knowing from where and you will get into situations in which you have no option to survive, especially if you're new to tactical shooters.\n- You will end up running... A lot..\n- Armor is not like battlefield or call of duty, you need a driver, gunner, commander and possibly a loader (has a machinegun). Where you hit the enemy matters as much as what you hit him with (Armor piercing on his front turret will likely bounce, but even a high explosive may hurt if you can hit him up the rear)\n\nStill here... ?\n\nIf I haven't scared you off, here are my personal tips:\n- Play. The. Tutorial.  Like really...\n- Try different graphic settings, shadows especially makes a big difference in enemy visibility (game looks better with them though)\n- Start as infantry and pick rifleman, but remember to join a squad.\n- Find a server that seems to have active admins and have a ruleset you agree with.\n- Try NOT to give up when you die, generally it isn't worth throwing away a ticket to respawn if you have friendlies within 100m. Sometimes it is the right choice, but before you know which is which, it's a good idea to hold on for a medic.\n- Not all squad leaders know what they're doing, do not be afraid to join another squad if it turns out your squad leader is a fool.\n- Defending is often as important (if not more), than attacking... But you may end up waiting 30 minutes without getting shot at or shooting anyone.\n\n\nAs you can probably tell... Squad is a community based game, with in-depth enough mechanics, while also being easily accessable.\nIf you want a good sense of what the game is, check out some lesser known streamer playing it (bigger streamers will often give you the wrong sense of what a game is like)\n\nHope this helped you make an informed decision.\n\nbut for now there are better options out there.\n- Having currently 1340 hours of playtime and having reached the highest achievable rank (Grand Champion), I can't currently recommend others to follow what I've been doing.\n\nWhile I love the game for it's smooth gameplay and somewhat balanced roster of playable character, the company, Stunlock Studios, are simply not caring for this game the way it deserves. In the start of 2018 we got a roadmap of promised features. This roadmap has since been tossed aside, and the community mocked, as they left battlerite arena development for months to do a battleroyale gamemode, which then turned into a standalone game, which then flopped and as of now has around 1/10 of the active playerbase that Battlerite has.\n\nAs others have also said, the matchmaking is horrible, especially at higher ranks. This can probably be attributed to the low playercount. At the highest ranks, it would not be uncommon to have a queue of 10-15 minutes only to be matched against people at a significantly lower skill level, which then leaves everyone in the match unhappy. This is in Europe, which I believe is the region with the highest playercount.\n\nTo sum it up, I believe this was a game with great potential, which has been wasted by a company with 40 employees, somehow only doing updates like they were a company of 3 people.\n- ROLLBACK NETCODE BABYYYYYY\n- This might literally be the coolest game I've ever played, and possibly the best game that I've played in the last 10 years.\n\nThough, I might be the wrong person to ask though as Earthbound is my favorite game, and this game is obviously heavily Earthbound inspired. Stylistically and comedy wise anyway. The story is much darker than anything in Earthbound, but it's all buried underneath some of the funniest writing I've ever seen in a game. The writing start to finish is amazing, I'm only dissappointed that the game wasn't longer as there's a few questions left unanswered.\n\nI did normal mode, first run, collected all characters and beat the game in 12-13 hours. For 10 dollars, that's pretty alright. The fights are pretty open ended as there are like 20+ characters you can choose from, but I ended up using Rage, Bottles and Mad Dog. I found it wasn't the hardest game I've played, but I also haven't tried pain mode yet.\n\nAnyway, if this game interests you at all, buy it. You won't regret it.\n- I just finished Metro 2033 Redux a while ago, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. One of the best things is that the game is COMPLETELY in a first person perspective, including the cutscenes. Reminded me of Bioshock Infinite a bit in that respect. You are fully immersed in your world. Except for the ending though..for some reason they chose to do a zoomed out pre-rendered cutscene there. \n\nI played on Survival mode (normal difficulty) and the challenge was decent. At one or two points in the game, it wasn't clear to me what to do (probably wasn't paying attention to the dialogues), but I like the no-hand-holding thing. At the last level as well, I ended up running out of filters (pretty sure I scoured all around for supplies and hit the limit many times) so that kinda took away from the experience a bit. \n\nBut otherwise, the story was good. Decent enemy variation. Stealth is possible against humans as well (game doesn't explicitly tell you this IIRC). Just make sure you crouch all the time and turn off your flashlight!\n\nCombat was great as well. The weapon handling felt really good. I found a quad-barrel shotgun and that was massive. Killed all Watchmen in a single shot! \n\nAtmosphere was realistic and well done. Performance was great as well on my humble GTX 750 (with medium settings). \n\nIt's hard for me to find fault with the game. I went in with little expectation, but then again I also don't play much FPS games. This is definitely better gameplay wise than Bioshock Infinite and Spec Ops: The Line though.\n- I have played enough of this game to say that I really, really love it.\n\nI have played every Assassin's Creed game, even the ones on the DS and the mediocre PSP game. This is by far the best Assassin's Creed.\n\nFirst of all, the naval combat is intuitive and really fluid and satisfying. The combat is the same \"Press B to counter\", but the addition of guns and darts do make things more interesting.\n\nWhile most of the time you are at sea \"pirating\", the sections on land are also really good. While the tailing and eavesdropping sessions are frustrating at times and boring at others, the free running is more fluid than ever, with realistic animations and few obstacles that can stop you.\n\nThe story is interesting and does encourage you to play all the main missions. However, there is a huge variety of side missions that can be played as soon as you get your ship to sail the enormous maps, where many ships sail and where whales swim.\n\nI have not played a lot of the multiplayer because I don't find it that interesting and varied.\n\nOverall, this is the best AC game so far: improved gameplay, lenghty and fun, it only makes me more pumped for Assassin's Creed Unity.\n\nSCORE: 90/100\n- I had to purchase Scarlet Hollow after witnessing the excitement of Episode 4 through my friends. I immediately binged the first three episodes the following day and found myself and in rather different spot compared to their playthrough. The choices you make in SH are actually impactful - which is (unfortunately) quite refreshing for the genre! I've since run through several different routes to explore more of the story (and collect those achievements!). While you have the ability to skip through previously seen text, lines within replayed conversations are shaped by your selected traits, choices, and previously selected dialogue; you won't be skipping that many lines before seeing new content. Similarly, characters may be painted in an entirely different light based on choices you've made. The cast and writing truly nails the small town feel of SH (gossip and all). \n\nMake sure you eat the takeaway container in the fridge. Thank me later.\n- It's illegal that this game is free.\n- How the hell did I not hear about this until the very end of 2021?\n\nA beautiful blend of all your favourite action-adventures: Your Zeldas, Metroidvanias, Dark Souls, Megamans (more Zero/ZX), Features local/steam play-together co-op. \n\nThe OST also slaps. I don't expect very moody noir piano in my dystopian cybernetic future but here we are.\n- Do I really have to write this review? I am just one in thousands of people who wrote a positive reveiw for Garry's Mod. Chances are, this review will never convince someone to buy Garry's Mod. It'll just be lost in the 100,000 positive reviews out there. Well, here I go anyway.\n\n\"Where do I start?\" This is the question asked by anyone playing Gmod for their first time. It's also my question that I ask about this review I am writing. Hmm...\n\n_The gameplay...the gameplay...hmm... Well, there's singleplayer sandbox. You can do...uh, whatever you want really. Just addon a few addons, and you can be entertained for hours. Battle NPCs, make cool scenes for cool screenshots, explore maps, be a superhero (spiderman addon!), and much, much, much, much- you get my point, right? Almost all content is user-generated. Make your own content! Multiplayer. In Multiplayer Gmod you can roleplay. I'm talking normal RP (DarkRP), Military RP, Star Wars RP, etc, etc. In multiplayer Gmod, you can battle, prophunt (yay), hide 'n seek, and much, much, more.\n\n_Graphics? I'll rate the graphics...drumroll please... 7/10. This game is and older game. Came out in 2006. I guess the graphics are good for 2006, and people enjoy the game and don't complain much about the graphics, but I'm not gonna lie, they are outdated and look old. It's not 2006 anymore.\n\n_Hear the bullets flying. The zombies growling. The people chatting. The boxes jumping... The sound in this game is great! Every sound is loud and clear, and there are a varitey of sounds.\n\n_Play this game. Play it again. Play it some more. Play some now, and play some later. Play it over and over. Play it as long as you want.\n\n_My Personal opinion. Get this game. Now. Get Gmod on sale or not. I'm not gonna stop playing it for a while and I'm already at 50+ hours of playtime. I love this game! WAIT! Before you go and buy this, then you wonder why there are all the missing maps and errors in most games, get Counter Strike: Source, so ALL the textures are supported. You need it to play MOST multiplayer games.\n\n\nGameplay: 9/10\nGraphics: 7/10\nStory: N/A\nSound: 8/10\nReplayability: 10/10\n\nOverall 8.5\n\nEven though, this is one positive review on Garry's Mod, out of the thousands of positive reviews that have been submitted Garry's Mod, I hope this one convinces you to buy... Gmod\n\n-Star_Hawk_\n- This is one of the most beautiful games I played since Shadow of the Colossus. And much like SOTC This game is a visual delight not all the visual feel pointless or feel to in your face no all of it is PURE atmosphere and really enhances the experience when exploring the many levels in the game. The game's ability to tell a very deep story visually without any dialog or exposition to undermine the player is absolutely brilliant. the game be very diffult the first time playing but feels rewarding after you level up Ori as you continue to fight bad guys.\n\n My rating is 10/10\n A stunning game with a compelling storyline that worth every penny\n- Minutes ago, this reviewer completed the game Gorogoa. And now, an attempt will be made to describe the experience. It won’t be easy…….\n\nIn 1968 this player went to the theatre to see a brand-new movie: 2001: A Space Odyssey. What crossed the screen wasn’t so much a story in the filmmaking sense., but rather an experience. Views of Earth from space (before such images existed IRL), and a final scene that perhaps no one understood, but clearly was meaningful beyond simply the ability, or need, for words to express. Gorogoa left this player with a very similar feeling of inexplicable fulfillment.\n\nGorogoa might be described as a puzzle game, but certainly not in any typical sense. More accurately, Gorogoa is a game about travel, but traversing distance in more ways than just spatially. It’s about travel within, and travel to places unknown (perhaps outside of dreams.) It’s about traveling through space, time, life (and lives), and travel through the experience that is mankind. And perhaps more, it’s about the journey necessary for each player to experience in order to be able to complete the experience that is Gorogoa.\n\nGorogoa provides very little information or assistance, beyond the option for hints about the areas of each image that need be considered for game progress. (It’s difficult to imagine a first-time player succeeding without such hints, so no stigma should be associated with them, especially if they prevent the need for outside resources as may well be the case.) Almost nothing more can be said without compromising some aspect of this game, so this review will be brief, and likely almost as mysterious as the game itself. Learning the goal is as much a puzzle as is the process of reaching that goal. Images are moved, shrunk, expanded, combined, variously manipulated…….ENOUGH! \n\nPlay, and learn about possibilities unimagined until now. In a single word…genius.\n\nThank you.\n\n(As with most Steam games, offline game time is not tracked.)\n- Overall better cast than the first game. But it has a few problems that DR1 didn't have, which to me was what made the game fun in the first place.\n\nDR1 spoilers: [spoiler] All of them seem capable of killing which I couldn't say about the first game where it was obvious that weedman, the giant and donut girl wasn't a threat to you. [/spoiler]\n\nDR2 spoilers:  [spoiler] However unlike the first game where Kirigiri, Byakuya and other characters were arguing during the trial and bringing up interesting points. DR2 has a lack of persuasive characters. There's effectively just Nagito (who argues in your favor half the time anyway) and Chiaki. The other characters never challenges you in a convincing way.[/spoiler]\n- [h1]A True Classic[/h1] \n[u]scroll down for my general consensus[/u]\n\n[b]===[ Audience ]===  [/b]\n☐ Kids\n☐ Everyone\n☑ Casual players\n☐ Pro players\n\n [b]===[ Graphics ]===  [/b]\n☐ Potato\n☐ Terrible\n☐ Bad\n☐ OK\n☑ Good \n☐ Beautiful \n☐ Drop Dead Gorgeous\n☐ Real life\n\n[b]===[ Price/Quality ]===  [/b]\n☑ Full price \n☐ Wait for sale \n☐ Average\n☐ Refund it if you can\n☐ Don't do it\n\n[b]===[ Requirements ]===  [/b]\n☑ 00's PC\n☐ Minimum\n☐ Medium\n☐ Fast\n☐ High end \n☐ NASA computer\n\n[b]===[ Difficulty ]=== [/b]\n☐ You just need 2 arms \n☐ Too easy\n☐ Easy\n☑ Medium\n☐ Hard\n☐ Dark Souls\n☐ Battletoads\n\n [b]===[ Game time/length ]=== [/b]\n☐ Really short\n☐ Short \n☐ Few hours\n☑Normal Runtime (clocking at 15h)\n☐ Long (about 30[i]ish[/i] hours)\n☐ Endless\n\n[b]===[ Blood/Gore ]===[/b]\n☐ No\n☑ Only blood\n☐ Blood and some Graphic Violence but not something extreme\n\n[b]===[ Violence ]=== [/b]\n☐ No\n☐ Mild\n☑ Average\n☐ Violent\n☐ Manhunt\n☐ Mortal Kombat\n\n[b]===[ Soundtrack ]===[/b]\n☐ No\n☐ Annoying\n☐ Better than Despacito\n☐ Good\n☑ Cool and very creative\n☐ Masterpiece\n\n[b]===[ Story ]===[/b]\n☐ No\n☐ Better than Twilight\n☐ OK (more on that below)\n☑ Good\n☐ Fantastic\n\n[b]===[ Bugs ]===  [/b]\n☐ Game itself is one big BUG\n☐ Bugs destroying the game\n☐ Many bugs\n☑ Few Bugs\n☐ No bugs\n\n[b]===[ Others ]=== \nStory: 9/10\nGameplay: 9/10\nSound Design: 8.5/10 ( I didn't like the sound mixing)\nOverall: 9.5/10[/b]\n\n[h1]A true classic. [/h1] \n\n\n[h1]===[ General Consensus ]===[/h1]\n\n[b]This was the baseline for two entire generations of Single-Player FPS[/b]\n\n[u]The Half-Life series is considered to be one of the \"Grandfathers\" of modern FPS. Along with some other titles of its generation, it revolutionized the shooter genre, giving games a new depth and even bigger focus on storytelling and big setpieces, remeniscent of action genre movies. And naturally, Half-Life 2 is remembered one of the finest games to be realized and developed, even after a tumultuous and bumpy development.[/u]\n\n\nI only came to the awareness of this game's status in the gaming world a few years ago. I never really heard too much about it or even payed to much attention to it; back in my childhood I remember seeing it around the internet but it never really talked to me.\nSo a few years back I bought the whole HL franchise here on Steam, already acquainted with the game's praise. \n\nAfter a couple of failed attempts to play HL2, but getting stuck on the same part, I finally got to finish the game. \nAnd I must say I'm totally on board with all the praise and status!\n\n\n[h1]PLOT:[/h1]\n\nThe story continues after the events of Half-Life 1, where Gordon Freeman, a scientist working on the Black Mesa Research Facility, fights his way through hords of aliens brought to Earth by a portal that Gordon himself opened.\n\nWe wake-up to a dystopian future where the Black Mesa and the alien infestation led to a very different world of ours, where humans live in a opressing society on the likes of the book \"1984\", where everyone is meticulously controlled by the \"system\".\nThis hugely different and creative setting really talked to me and even made me more interested in the narrative.\n\nFrom then on, Freeman tries to lead a group of \"resistence\" fighters to oppose and tear down the ruller of Earth, the former administrator of the Black Mesa Facility, Wallace Breen, (whom also \"negotiated\" a peace agreement with the aliens, right after the events of HL1).\n\nI must say this story is a very creative and different experience of those found in other FPS games.\nI always found myself on the edge of my seat, eager to know what was gonna happen next, and while also amazed by all the environmental storytelling.\nIt's truly one of the game's strongest points and even though your character doesn't speak, you will find yourself completely imersed on the narrative. Even all these years after, this political and social matter that Valve went for and explored is one of the game's strongest points really!\n\nAnd not to forget about all of those fantabulous and explosive setpieces seen throughtout the game that are really solid and entretaining, having inspired other games like Uncharted and the Call of Duty campaigns, just to say a few. You are really put in some tricky and tough situations.\n\n\n[h1]GAMEPLAY:[/h1]\n\nThis is your average FPS gameplay. Nothing you haven't seen before, but HL2 is certainly a gold standard of how to excell and give variety in your gameplay.\n\nYou've got your normal 2000's arsenal, like Pistols, the series' signature weapon the Crowbar, a Revolver that packs a serious punch, an SMG, Assault Rifle, Shotgun (THAT FEELS SO GOOD TO SHOOT), Grenades, Crossbow, Rocket Laucher and a new \"toy gun\" the Gravity Gun.\n\nAt the time, Valve was developing a new physics engine never seen before that went on to shake and revolutionize games at the time, but in order to really make usage of this new technology, [u]the developers of Half-Life 2 introduced the Gravity Gun to the weapons roster [/u]. \nWith it you can \"grab\" multiple objects, such as crates, file cabinets, gasoline tanks or even buzzsaw blades to throw at oponents. It's a very creative way to make usage of the different environment assets while showing off new technology.\nIt's also another tool to help you get out of sticky situations like puzzles, something that Half Life 2 really experiments with. \nWith this engine, Valve pushed the physics to bring different puzzles that just feel natural to solve.\n\nGameplay feels really natural and it's what we have grown accostumed to in the FPS genre, but very competent and polished.\n[spoiler](the shotgun just feels awesome and sooooo satisfying to shoot)[/spoiler]\n\n\n[h1]SOUND AND MUSIC:[/h1]\n\nSound feels like a very big step-up comparing to Half-Life 1 and every weapon sound much better when firing.\n\nEnvironmental sound is really good and pushes you even more to the game's immersion. Every area of the game is masterfully design, to the sewer sections that feel so claustrophobic and tense to walk through, to the more city like big places where you can sense the real sense of scale of the space through the sound design. \n\nI must say it's really top notch.\n\nBut there were times where I felt that the sound mixing was a little off, having sounds playing with a really pumped up volume that really distracted me and put me off.\n\nIn the other hand, the Music is just amazing. It's 00's techno and rock like music that just injects you with such adrenaline and makes you feel really awesome with gunning down opponest. VERY SATIFYING INDEED.\n\n\n[h1]GRAPHICS:[/h1]\n\nIn all honesty this is a hard category to judge, because obviously the graphics are going to look a bit dated to what we have today (in 2020), but honestly everything look really good.\n\nFrom characters and enemies, to the environments, to the fire and explosion effects, it all looks very good and has a great level of quality to them. Specially the alien creatures. I felt utterly disturbed by those \"facehuggers\" like creatures. Everytime they jumped at my face I would equally jump, but of my seat with disgust... \n\n\n[h1]CONCLUSION:[/h1]\n\n[b]To summ it up, I think that Half-Life 2 is a must play game. \n\nReally, if you are like me and you have heard about it, but was like \"meh maybe this game is old and dated and its now crap\", just cut the argument and go play a really good and polished experience.\n\nFor those out there, if you want a polished and strong game that still challenges most contemporary games, with an interesting narrative, and some awesome moments just grab yourself a copy of this. It's dirt cheap, no excuses...[/b]\n- Let's say you capture a prisoner after a bloody raid on your colony. Do you want to:\n\n1. Let them go in the hopes of improving relations with the attackers? YOU CAN DO THAT.\n\n2. Heal them and have colonists talk to them about how great your colony is until they join? YOU CAN DO THAT.\n\n3. Have a colonist with a high medical skill remove their liver to transplant into an alcoholic colonist? YOU CAN DO THAT.\n\n4. Have a colonist with a low medical skill remove their organs just for practice? YOU CAN DO THAT.\n\n5. Eat them because you forgot to stock up on food for the winter? YOU CAN DO THAT.\n\nReally, what else do you need in a game?\n- First steps:\n-set nioh.exe and nioh_launcher.exe to win7 compatibility (if you experience crashes).\n-first level (London) is poorly optimized, so better rush through it and judge the next.\n-experience this game as Nioh and not as a \"Souls\" game, tho I draw comparisons here\n\n\n[h1]Good[/h1]\n\nCombat\nBy far the best thing about the game. You get 7 weapon classes + 3 ranged weapons, and each of the 7 weapons has it's own unique skillset accompanied by 3 different stances. On the fly switching between 3 stances and 2 weapons, or even both at the same time allows for a ton of combinations to chain different attacks and combos. On top of all that you get magic, spirit guardians and ninjutsu. Sky is the limit if you're willing to experiment.\n\n\nBosses\nThe game comes with roughly over 30 unique bossfights, some of them will reappear or be demoted to regular enemies over the course of the game. There are only very few bosses I didn't like. Most of them are going to be human, but that doesn't mean they are boring. Most have sick movesets that make them very engaging and fun to fight, especially the DLC bosses. \n\n\nDifficulty\nJust like Dark Souls the game is as difficult as you want it to be. This means you get alot of tools that allow you to cheese the game. Like summons, or certain character builds centered around spirit guadians and op magic like sloth talisman which makes enemies move in slow motion. \nThe difficulty curve is a falling one, aka the game is more difficult in the begining when you're figuering things out, then it remains on a steady level with occasional spikes upwards. Disregarding bs like sloth talisman I would say the game is overall more difficult than Dark Souls. Combat is faster and mistakes are punished severly, even human fodder enemies can 1-shot you if you happen to take swings when they are in heavy stance.\n\n\nStory\nIt's decent, but nothing special. Nerds interested in the sengoku period to early edo period \nwill probably appreciate the characters and their interactions.\n\n\nWorld\nIt's not an interconnected world like DS1. It is mission based where you pick main or side missions from a map, personally I don't mind the \"arcade\" style. Main missions themself are big levels with multiple shortcuts that loop back to shrines (bonfires). Those levels are bigger than most designated areas in DS3, my guess is like 1.5x-2x the size. If I had to rank the level design... DS1 >>>> DS3 > Nioh >>>>>>> DS2 \n\n\nReplayability\nThe game offers 4 NG difficulties which spice things up by switching enemy placements or giving enemies (and bosses) status effects and new moves. Other than that you get Abyss mode which is most comparable to DMC's bloody palace. \n\n\nMultiplayer/Netcode + pseudo PvP\n3 ways to play mutiplayer: as summon/summoner, co-op missions where both players make progress at the same time and PvP (which is dead).  The Netcode worked quite well for me, even over wide distances like brazil-germany. I never had to adjust for delay and could parry attacks just like offline.  The netcode is quite good imo compared to DS3 where I did lots of co-op at Champion Gundyr and parrying was totally out of the question.\n\n\nThe other \"pvp mode\" is the faction/clan system. You get multiple clans that belong to 1 of the 2 factions. A clan gives you 2 passive buffs that can compliment your playstyle. You obtain glory by killing revenants, succesfull co-op or pvp for your clan. The more glory you obtain, the higher the rank of your faction, clan and yourself. Glory acts as another currency and can be used to buy npc skins, gestures or items.\n\n\nFashion Souls\nLike the look of a particular light armor set but hate getting insta killed by radroaches? No problem, at the blacksmith you can transform any weapon skin or piece of armor, and keep the stats of your preferred equipment. If you get tired of playing as William you can buy npc skins for glory at the teahouse (unlocks at roughly 33% of the game) which is the only way to play as a female as there is no character creation.\n\n[h1]Bad[/h1]\n\nEnemy Variaty\nThe games biggest weakness in my opinion.  Enemy \"species\" come in different flavours, e.g. humans can wield any of the 7 weapons, however this doesn't realy trigger the visual stimulation of seeing something new. Saving grace: the game throws you into different 1vsX situations, so the combination of enemies keeps things interesting, kinda like DMC4 which also has wack enemy variety. I think they could've done much more in terms of creativity when it comes to the yokai/oni realm given the huge amount of lore.\n\n\nRepetition\nSide missions take place in mostly the same batch of areas or in parts of main missions. \nThey try to keep things fresh by switching enemies and spawn points. But they still feel kinda tedious because skipping them isn't realy an option as you can't deny yourself the experience, rewards and loot.\n\n\nMusic\nGood but gets repetitive as only few themes are shared across bosses.\n\n\nFunky Optimization\nSelf explainatory. FPS tanks in London and I had random crashes. The later were solved by the tips mentioned at the top of the review.\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nI found the combat mechanics to be more than able to compensate for the games weaknesses (repetition, enemy variety). This means you've to take up responsibility and be creative yourself. If you're the type who doesn't like experimenting and spends 90% of his time with spear in mid stance, and plays like its DS (dodge > R1 > R1 > dodge > R1 > dodge...), then you're gonna get bored quickly. Although, I've seen those guys during co-op all the way up to NG3-4, so who knows... .\n- Ok to make it short.\n\n- Poor graphics (like 10 years old PC game)\nBUT nothing more to complain about.\n\n- great atmosphere, great story, very good fighting mechanics. Of course great price.\n\nIf you have nothing against japan style - just play the game. One of funniest games in some years for me.\n- For a company as big as Amazon, this game is extremely sub par. It feels as though it's in Early Access and some of the recent patch notes are very worrying for the game's future\n\nPros:\n- Stunning gfx. Especially for an MMO, the lighting in particular is amazing\n- Sound track is great and ambience adds personality to the zones\n- Some really cool zones to explore, feels as though you can get lost when you start\n- Controls/Keybinds are already really good imo, I only changed a few\n- Tutorial/Starter Quest chains do a great job of introducing you to the game without being too slow\n- Combat (when it works) Is really fun. Lots of action based fights\n- Wars are a really cool mechanic, they are ultimately flawed but are still a lot of fun\n\nCons:\n- Game is extremely shallow. It is borderline addicting for the first few levels, this soon dies off. When (If) You reach lvl 60, you ask yourself what do you do now?\n- As beautiful as the game is, a lot of it is copy and pasted. Literally. There are zones, towns, dungeons that are almost identical. Ruins immersion\n- Quests are extremely repetitive and boring. They consist of kill mobs, loot mobs, loot chests and that’s about it. No diversity\n- Combat can be laggy, you weapon swap and it doesn’t register sometimes. Wars can be a PowerPoint Presentation at times\n- Guild UI is awful. There is no guild bank, treasury ledger so you cannot monitor who donates money for wars etc. Makes running a guild a nightmare\n- There are countless exploits and duplications that have been abused upsetting economies, player numbers and the general integrity of the game\n- Server population has been decimated since launch leading to many dead servers. They’re merging already\n- There are some very worrying patch notes/future releases that are changing fundamental mechanics of the game. In some cases nerfs which punish players who didn’t rush to level cap\n- Watermark is a stupid progression system for gear. It forces you to run daily elite zone farm chains which get extremely repetitive\n\nIf this was a small indie dev company, I could give them the benefit of the doubt. However this is frickin’ Amazon. This product is totally unacceptable and needs to go back in the oven.\n\n- IMHO this game is highly over-hyped, glad I only spend a few € and bought it at sale.\n\n- Basic concept of dungeon crawling with horror is copied from D&D Ravenloft or Call of Cuthullu. So nothing new here. \n- Story is simple and stereotypical: Old man evokes some unnamed horror in a cursed mansion that curses the land...  \n- Graphics are nicely painted ... but still painted, so outdated concept. It's a indy game, ok ... and maybe some gamers still love playing games on their 386er personal computers from 1990 ...\n- The gameplay itself is IMHO stale, because it's always the same: go into a dungeon. Fight. Grind. Survive.\n- Stress could be an interesting factor, but not in the way it is implemented. In its current form is nothing but a second health bar, which is either difficult or expensive to heal. It makes the game not more complex or more interesting but only more frustrating. Stress could be interesting, if it had different stages with different effects. But in its current form and the difficulty of the game itself it is simply idiotic to take stressed heroes into battle. \n- Random number generator is bad. Really bad. Maybe intentional bad? Who knows...?\n\nThe game itself is grind, more grind, and … grind. Combined with the lame story and the frustration it is a game for masochists and people that want to become one.\n- I've been playing this game since it was in Kickstarter! It is the best Story Rich game that I have ever played and the most unique. I have played through maybe 7 times and it's different every time. The ability to replay this game countless times is what makes it such a great game. Tons of questions that change based on the questions you've asked, you see a question that might not be there after you ask another question instead. Every version of this game that I played kept my interest and had me sitting on the edge of my seat waiting for more. I have reached 2 endings so far and I can't wait to see what happens next. The Developers are great, I can't wait to see what they create next.\n- I play 100+ puzzle games every year and this is likely my favourite release of 2020.\n\nDraknek and his team have truly advanced the state of the art in how the game's world is put together and how exploration and puzzle-solving are interconnected. There is no other puzzle game that does quite what this one does in terms of the interaction between mechanics design, navigation, and secret-finding. It's not just a game about pushing and rolling cylinders around, it's a game about really interesting cause-and-effect relationships between the cylinders, the spaces they're placed in, and the places that you wanna get to but can't.\n\nIf you're a serious puzzle gamer, don't be put off by the game's pastel appearance and the choice of marketing and press quotes that emphasize the soothing or cozy nature of the gameplay. The game's content, including the low-difficulty puzzles, are still very interesting even if you're an experienced puzzle-solver. \n\nThe approachability of the game is achieved by having an \"easy path\" through most of the areas. In this case, easy does not mean \"uninteresting\", but instead means \"interesting puzzles that are rigged so that low-skill solvers are highly likely to stumble upon the solution\". If you're a veteran puzzle-solver, you may not even realize this. It's quite clever. The puzzles off the \"easy path\" are quite challenging (some mind-bogglingly so) and many are incredible feats of design that you will not want to miss.\n\nThe art, sound, and writing are competently executed, and the controls, audio, and visuals do not get in the way of the puzzle-solving. The narrative is entirely flavourtext and is completely irrelevant to the puzzle content, so you can ignore it if you don't care for it (but some of it is hilarious).\n\nThere is one \"thing I wish I knew before I started playing\", and this is that if you want to find all the secrets, you should first rush to complete to the game (get to the credits) before spending a lot of time trying to find secrets. Trying to 100% each area individually during your first playthrough will lead to a lot of frustration and wasted time.\n\nThis game is wonderful. I hope Drak makes an expansion/sequel with another 500+ islands. There are enough unused tricks and unexplored design space here that he could easily fill it (but adding 3x1 logs might also be fun).\n- This is the best Civilization up to this point, and the DLC just made it even better. I will grant that the with all the add ons it would feel a tad crowded to anyone who hadn't played it before, but you have a crazy amount of options. The game series tagline of \"one more turn\" could not be more applicable.\n\nYou can strive for one of several victories: diplomatic, cultural, technological or domination. Each has its unique challengers to overcome and create a lot of the fun of the game. They are also not necessarily mutually exclusive and after completing one victory, you can go for the others. Each AI opponent has their own personality, and are pretty predictable in how they behave. Any one who has started the game next to Neopoleon or Ghengis Kahn knows they immediately have to have a decent military to repel invasion, while Ghandi will to muscle you out with religion and culture.\n\nThere are some important changes between Civilization IV and V. One of the most notable is that wars are plausible again as you dont constantly lose health in enemy territory and cities are easier to conquer. Additionally, culture doesn't automatically take over neighbor's cities anymore. \n\nThis game is easily worth the money. I'm not entirely sure how it stacks up to Civilization VI, but any game that I log 200+ hours on over a period of years and still haven't come close to doing everything is doing something right. A great game from a great series.\n- Homeworld is typically known as the very first 3D RTS -- despite this distinguishing trait, it's not very popular. It's rather obscure, which I find odd for a game that was made with so much love and detail. The story of the two Homeworld campaigns is very nice, the aesthetic of the game is excellent in my opinion, but when it comes to the multiplayer, in vanilla 2.1 Homeworld, the current version, you will face severe balancing issues between the races.\nFortunately, the community has come up with a solution, one that took a lot of time and effort to be. Thanks to them, the multiplayer is now playable with the patch that they made -- the 2.3 players patch. It's still being updated and is worked on by people who understand the overall concept of the game and the genre it belongs to.\nIt's available to everyone in the workshop and is in my opinion (and a lot of others's) the best way to experience both multiplayer and the game itself.\n- Plants, please: A horticultural document thriller.\nGlory to Undermere.\nPros: \n- the writing and its illusion of effortless brilliance\n- attention to detail and consequences for player actions\n- \"gotta catch 'em all\" mentality that actually makes you feel smart\n- the intrigue, world-building, and game flow\n- petting the cat\n\nCons: I wish there was more music, or just none at all most of the time.\n- And that's it, after 278 hours of play, the adventure is over... \nThis type of game that you wish you could forget so you could rediscover it like the 1st time, where you discover everything, a bit like a child\nIt's a game made with passion for video games, to tell a story, to make the player laugh too, and to make him a little melancholic or horrified or even sickened sometimes\n\n[u]Divinity OS 2 will have marked my young adult life[/u], like Sonic and megadrive games, Pokémon, FFTactics, Zelda and gameboy / gamecube games, Warcraft3 (TT), or Mass Effect and other PC games did in my childhood and adolescence (I surely forget so much excellent games)\n\nIt's a 20/20 for me. The work is titanic. The game is really made with passion. The studio is very talented.\n\nSo when Steam asks me [i]\"Do you recommend this game\"[/i], I say:\nYes! Because this is where you feel that video games are an experience, an adventure to live! \nI went through Rivellion with my buddy, like I went through Kanto (Pokémon), or Ivalice in FF Tactics as a kid!\n\n\n[u][b]Atmosphere:[/b][/u]\nMany of us probably remember our adventures in Pokémon or other games in our childhood. We roamed, discovered and lived in these worlds!\n\nHere, it's the same thing, and not alone this time: I was with a very good friend! \nWe met frequently to venture into the world of Divinity as a lightning lizard warrior or a skeletal assassin with a mysterious past...\n\nWith our companions Lohse and Ifan, and Maladie, and Gareth, and Jahan and Han the survivor kid and Sir Lora and so many others. Impossible to forget... \n[i]They exist! Stop lying, I know they exist ![/i]\n\nOur choices were important: We decided to do justice to this or that person, provoking reactions (or death) in certain characters, slapping a few Magisters around when necessary\nAnd of course, we STRONGLY decided to stea... Borrow a lot of spells and equipments from the merchants, while the other one was distracting by chatting...\n... What? We didn't have the money and we had to save the world ! Well, we had the money, but you never know, maybe one day we will need it... !\nAnd then stealing, it's fun. And exhilarating hehehe\n\n\n[u][b]Gameplay:[/b][/u]\nA 3D tactical turn-based game, to play with friends. Really ! Don't play this game alone, I'm sure that with at least 1 buddy (or 3!), you will exploit the game to its full potential!\n\nAlso, [u]you can change your skills and class at any moment in the game[/u], it's very flexible ! I played rogue all my game, and in the last chapiter, I decided to play with spear and War skills ! I really enjoyed being able to switch like this, as I want ! The game want you to take FUN, not \"suffering\" your \"bad\" class choices !\n\nToo bad, I don't know anyone who is ready to take on the role of a GM (Game Master), to live a personalized campaign! Because it is a mode apart from the main campaign!\n\n\n[u][b]Music:[/b][/u]\nExtremely good and fits perfectly with the atmosphere of the game. This kind of OST that we listen to when we work and that makes us live our adventures again when the song becomes EPIC!\n\n\n[u][b]In summary:[/b][/u]\nTitanic content, assured re-playability for those who wish to know what would have happened if they had answered something else than \"FIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT\", and I repeat, the fact of being able to play with friends makes the game so much more pleasant to do!\n\n\n[b]*Sob*[/b]\nBut no, I'm not crying... I'm just allergic to emotions!\n\nI would like so much to forget this game to be able to rediscover it\n\nPlease play it, at least give it a try, and let yourself be immersed in Div's world!\n\nIn our case, we will do it again in HARDCORE mode !\n\nPeace guys !\n- This is the fighting game that you give to a friend who doesn't play fighting games to learn, the Steam Edition of Killer Instinct comes with all of the characters as well as the extra premium skins that were added into the game. Killer Instinct has arguably one of the best tutorial systems that I have played with in recent years, if not one of the best period. It allows you to learn at a reasonable pace each and every one of the specific features of the game, including assists so that people are able to learn what combo breaker they need to use versus specific attacks. Combo Assist in this is less a crutch or a hand hold mechanic and more of a guide when it comes to using combos, it will automatically add in linkers to combos so that people who are unfamiliar with the game aren't left mashing buttons and making a fool of themselves because they don't know what they are doing, it will free flow the fight as best as it can to help guide people toward what they need to be doing, showing off what specials people could be doing to link the combo together and maximize the amount of damage they could possibly get, and due to the combo meter it stops people from being locked into combos forever since once a combo ends you are forced away, either by the opponent's combo ender or the combo forcing itself closed.\n\nThe price that they ask for on Steam you will get more out of the game than you could expect from something this priced. There are two story modes specific to the first two seasons of characters that came out, then with Season 3, which brought back the two original bosses from the franchise, Shadow Lords, a seperate scenario style campaign in which you pick the team that you wish to take in your attempt to overthrow the Shadow Lord himself. That's without taking into account the Shadow Lab mode which allows you to train a Shadow of yourself, an AI that learns and builds off your own patterns to fight in a similar manner to yourself, these Shadows are used within its own unique survival mode, as well as special missions that can crop up within the Shadow Lord mode.\n\nIf you're after a fighting game to get into, or you're looking to get a friend into fighting games, this is the best one that you could possibly start with, since it will not only teach the specific mechanics to this one, but also allow you to learn in time a lot of the mechanics that other competitive fighters share, though this one, eases you into it, so that it is a less daunting experience, as well as being much friendlier to new players.\n- This version comes bundled together with some kind of horrid bloatware called \"Steam\" which functions as a type of DRM meaning you do not actually own the game. Avoid at all costs, buy it on CD instead!\n- Honestly I don't think I've ever cried so much over one game.  This is definitely one of the best narrative driven RPG maker games ever made - it has everything you could want.  It has beautiful art, beautiful music, wonderful narration, it's atmospheric, great characters, meaningful choices, a story of overcoming hardships similar to a real life instead of just a story, and the ending I got was beautiful! I have only played the game once but the game has a lot of different branching paths with choices really making a large difference in the game.  This game will always have a special place in my heart.\n- So, I hated this game at first...\n\n I've never been into a MMO before, and I went into it with a mindset of \"FUCK YEAH! MULTIPLAYER SKYRIM LETS GO\" - In short don't do that. This isn't going to be like playing Skyrim, Oblivion, Morrowind. \n\nIt is when it all comes down to the core an MMO, it's set in Tamriel, it sounds like Tamriel and the storylines feel like an Elder Scrolls game. However being an MMO, it has a lot of grindy MMO style quests. And don't get me wrong, it's bewildering at first, all these mechanics, all these places to go....and before the 'One Tamriel' update if you chose the wrong faction, you were screwed, in a place all on your own surrounded by all these people who are WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY higher level than you. But thankfully they changed all of that. The game scales now, so you can rock up to a dungeon with your level V300 mate, and still have some fun slicing up enemies.\n\nSo I saw a friend playing the other day, and spent a few hours installing this to join him (By the way its like 70 Gig...If you have slow internet prepare for a few days of download), I got back on it after not playing for 14 months, but this time I was playing with a friend who was already Veteran Level 250, So I was in luck, he introduced me to everything and I got used to all the deconstructing of equipment to get my blacksmithing up, showed me about dungeons and bascially got me to enjoy the grind. I think my previous time was a bit lackluster because I got dropped in the middle of the Aldmeri Dominion on my own, without any of my friends. So I left.\n\nNow I know what I'm doing, and keep in mind I usually hate MMO's never played WoW or anything like that, this is the first one. I'm enjoying myself, I'm triple digits into this game time-wise and I don't see it stopping now. We've made a guild for noobies. To help them out, and get them to enjoy the game also. Because the community is nice...but you still get the elitist fucks from any competitive game kicking you out of dungeons because you're only level 14. But you won't get that when you're in a guild, having people to play with and explain all the mechanics did help, a lot. I've even gone as far as to buy this AGAIN on steam just to collect my hours and so on.\n\nAdd-ons are awesome being able to mod basic features of the game to help with information and quality of life improvements is a must. I'll provide an essential mods pack if any of you wish to know.\n\nFor those of you who actually got this far into this, well done. I didn't think I'd keep you captivated long enough to get to the end.\n\nIf any of you are new to the game, on EU server and would like to join a guild to show you the way, add me or visit our [url=www.godsofsalt.com]website[/url] and join us on teamspeak, or just message us in game @diseasedcrow.\n\nBut all in all if you like Elder Scrolls and you think you want to try this, just do, I'm glad I gave it a second chance.\n- This game looks incredible and I'm really enjoying the story so far. It does have some bugs still, but nothing I've come across has particularly bothered me, much less ruined the game. It's incredibly immersive and detailed, the voice acting is really good, and the gameplay is fun.\n- As a fan of Mimimi's Stealth Strategy Game,\nI love it so much, the operation system is getting smoother and more user-friendly comparing to Desperados III & Shadow Tactics.\nAlso I like how they added new elements to the game to make it more playable (E.g. Flexible team choice, character stories)\n\nThe only thing I don't like is the art.\nGame design is good but it'd be great if there's good looking characters...\n- Horrible game couldn't learn how to drift in 13 hours i was using a wheel btw apparently its harder but like wheel is cool I'm not gonna play it on controller that's lame. My dad also couldn't drift either and he knows how to drift irl. I also cant get a refund because i spent so long try to drift :(\n- As i previously stated, i was going to play through metro fully and i have done so, so here is my update to this review. \nThis game is not the best selling triple A game in the world and it may have some bugs (like a table that wasnt solid or the objects in that room lol) however it is a decent game. the story is decent and the characters voices are way off but they sorta make up for it with their personalities. \n\nExploration in this game is by far one of the most interesting in my opinion and the way your character acts in the enviroment makes it more interesting aswell, for example wiping your visor when it gets dirty (wasnt that helpful for me in my play through but it was a nice touch) and your visor taking damage in combat adds to the immersive feel of this wasteland/paradise almost. Scavenging weapons and parts and combining them to make better equipment is quite intriguing and quick to do if you can find the parts. \n\nat the end of the day my final review of this is its a good game i would play it again even if it is a bit clunky sometimes (atleast it was for me lmao)\n\n\n\n\n\nOh and hopefully my punctuation is good enough so no one passes out this time lmao\n- \nWell, after almost a year of not playing this game, I must say, the devs did fix most of my issues. *Most*. Creative mode is fun, but you still need to collect stuff to make things, which is incredibly tedious. On top of that, the character dialogue is still really annoying and you need a NASA computer to play at a stable framerate, but hey, you can actually play without getting your ass beat. I'd like to up my ranking to an 8/10. Very fun, but I highly recommend playing with others. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOG REVIEW (outdated):\nThis game has potential, but unfortunately having fun with it is impossible if you aren't a hardcore survivalist.\n\nCritical Issue #1:\nThe main characters won't stop talking. Everytime you eat or hold the torch they say an unfunny one-liner that makes me want to gouge my eyes out with forks. Even Robin Ayou from Subnautica: Below Zero talked less, and the original game had a silent protaganist. Having characters that have constant dialogue that always repeats is just so annoying to the point where I had to turn off the volume. If the main characters were silent but atleast talked with each other, then I could see potential in that. But they just talk and talk and talk and none of it means anything.\n\nCritical Issue #2:\nThe enemies are way too hard to battle. To make better gear, you need to take on enemies that are so difficult to battle. Maybe you could say I'm just not good at battling enemies in survival games, but I was able to easily battle monsters in Terraria, Minecraft, Subnautica and Raft just fine. When your in-game monsters are too hard to defeat without gear that requires you to battle even MORE monsters, it is not fun, repetitive, and frustrating.\n\nCritical Issue #3:\nThe story is in the background. The fact that the story doesn't impact the game as much as it should is probably the worst aspect of any piece of media out there. The game sends you an a goose chase to find the  main story and it is infuriating. The story itself is all over the place. First it just seems like you need to make yourself grow bigger, but then it goes completely off the rails and into this scientist bunker with a robot that gives you quests, but you can ignore him and continue playing. I don't know if they finished the story, but so far it is not good.\n\nSomewhat Critical Issue:\nThere is no setting to dial back the graphics without lowering the resolution to look like Terraria. I can't see, and it is dumb and brings the whole beautiful vibe of being small down, ironically.\n\nMinor Issues:\nThe music is bland, and although I love electronic/synth music, this is just not it. The fact that you can't have bugs as pets or mounts, or even herd them is extremely upsetting. The farming sucks ass, it gives you 4 items of what you grew every 2 in-game days, when you can just find that item in more abundance at the place where it is located. Under the pond... JESUS CHRIST, the graphics are so bad. The wavy filter looks so bad, and you can see the entire underwater area crystal f**king clear, even though other smaller bodies of water have some kind of murkiness to it. Minor issues like this hold back the game.\n\nAlthough this is still in early access, it feels as if they wasted a lot of potential already. For such a unique world and concept, it never really exploits the amazing and obvious things that it can accomplish. Why not grow your own personal army of ants? Oh sorry, you can pick up eggs but they hatch and they aren't friendly. Why not create a raft made of weed stems and lilypads? Oh sorry, you can just build a base that looks like a boat. Although there are much worse steam games out there, and ones that I have hated more than this, this was sort of a slap to the face. It's not god-awful, and there are a lot of good things about it like the cartoony bug designs and the beautiful graphics, but honestly, it's a 6/10 bordering on a 7, and although many others have enjoyed this, being the super critical demogorgon that I am, this didn't exactly \"ground\" me.\n- To date, AirMech is the closest thing to a fun MOBA-strategy hybrid I've ever played. Unfortunately, after I came back to this game recently, I have to change my review from Highly Recommended to Not Recommended (this is solely for AirMech Strike, and not related to Wastelands, its PvE counterpart, which I will do a review on at a later date).\n\nTowards the end of 2012, the game was doing really well. There were 500+ players online on average, and it was real easy to get a match.\n\n(+) PVP was simple. Choose your airmech, pilot, unit list, and one item that gives a certain minor bonus. Cosmetics are optional and offer no advantage.\n(+) Player Market introduced later on for trading cosmetic items.\n(+) Badges for people who supported the game.\n(+) Diamond rolls in the chat where players can randomly win Diamonds.\n\nHowever, some downsides also happened.\n(-) You need to pay fees to list an item on the market, using Diamonds, instead of Kudos.\n(-) Books were introduced to either increase trade slots and decrease fees. You needed to spend more Diamonds on these books.\n(+/-) Parts were introduced, adding buffs/debuffs to your AirMechs, though I personally preferred to limit stat customization to Pilots and Items, keeps things simple.\n(-) Nanoforge was introduced for crafting, but is a complicated mess. This wasn't necessary if the game itself wasn't so complex.\n\nWhen AirMech split into AirMech Strike and AirMech Wastelands:\n(-) Parts, Pilots and items were transferred to Wastelands. RIP customization for PVP.\n(+) Keys now available via daily login rewards (the only improvement I've seen).\n(-) Airmech balancing is way off. Once simple skills are now too specific, and there's no need for an ultimate skill, really. AirMech was fine without it.\n\n5 years later and the peak is just over 100 players. The devs took a simple fun game and made it so incredibly complicated that it's no longer a fun game, for me at least.\n\nI hope Carbon Games brings AirMech closer to the late 2012 version, which I feel is the best and most fun version.\n- Guys this game is brilliant!!\n\nIf you have the chance and you like nostalgic and engaging exploration and mystery solving, I promise you won't regret buying this one.\nI honestly kept searching for more games like this at Steam and I was not able to find any that were this good.\n\nThe pixelated artwork is >very< detailed.\nI don't know how to describe it, but every scene feels like it's straight out of a framed vintage painting that you'd see in a farm cottage made by the grandfather of the previous owner. It just has this vibe, and I love it.\n\nAll characters are voiced and the VAs did a really great job, especially the main VA. Sarcastic, funny and witty lines are all over, as well as capturing the weight of each life, of their memories, and when they share their stories.\n\nYou won't regret playing this one! Go ahead, and have a great excavation...\nDon't forget: the answer lies in the soil...\n- OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR!\n\nHow can it be a hate crime if my client loved doing it?\n- Would I recommend DBD? ...It's complicated.\n\nDead By Daylight is an unique experience of asymmetric hide and seek/tag with shifting rules. \nIs the game fun? Yes. Is it creative? Yes.\nIs it fair and enjoyable? Well, it depends.\nGames get very intense, and playing as killer is some of the most intense gaming experience I've ever accumulated...\nWhich is where things often go wrong. The survivors seem to have decided that the killers have to honor strict code of rules. Don't use these items, these abilities, or these strategies. If you do, you'll be insulted after the game.\nIf you follow these rules, the odds are that you will spend the game running in literal circles, the survivors will win, t-bag you at the gate and then insult you after the game. I don't know about you, but that kind of ruins the game for me. It is actually kind of amazing how helpless one can feel in this game.\n\nSo to conclude my thoughts; I really like the game, but I also really hate it. I can't recommend it, as every time I fire it up, there is about 50% chance I feel more harassed, than entertained.\nI play a lot of online games, from League of Legends to Tekken, but this is the only one that makes me frequently think: \n\"I should really uninstall this\"\n\nEdit: \nI returned after a long break, and I still kinda like the game. \nHowever, same pattern repeats whenever I return. Eventually, I get teabagged one time too many and uninstall the game. The game is fun, the community could not be much worse. And sadly, that often ruins the experience.\n- 1/10 play time is afk card farming\ncould not even finish one level\ncrashed on me when i just started building stuff every time\ndidn't even make it to seeing the enemy in game ever\n- ULTRAKILL is a fine game with cool movement mechanics. However most of the guns don't feel beefy at all and, really, there's not much content to be had. Wait for ACT 3 before forking out $20 for this.\n\nedit: after getting every p rank, gaming\n- [h1] 🕘          IMPRESSION:[/h1]\n* 2016: Game released\n* 2019: It seem fun, let's buy this\n* 2020: New content added\n* 2022: More content added\n\n🟢 = Available\n🔴 = Not available\n\n[h1]         GAMING CONTENT:[/h1] \n🟢 Teamwork with others\n🟢 Puzzle Challenges\n🟢 No Compass or Map Challenge\n🟢 Funny Avatar\n🟢 Customize Avatar\n🔴 3-4 players share screen\n🔴 Fast Sprint\n🔴 Time Attack for replay value\n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [th]iMeter[/th]\n        [th]SCORED[/th]\n        [th]iNTEREST METER[/th]\n        [th]DISCOUNT?[/th]\n [th]COMMUNITY[/th]\n        [th]REVIEWER[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [th]A+[/th]\n        [td]5[/td]\n        [td]Loving it [/td]\n        [td]No Wait[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [th]A[/th]\n        [td]4[/td]\n        [td]Liked it[/td]\n        [td]No Wait[/td]\n        [td] ✔[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [th]B[/th]\n        [td]2-3[/td]\n        [td]Half satisfied[/td]\n        [td]Wait 50%[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n        [td] ✔[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [th]C[/th]\n        [td] 1[/td]\n        [td]Less Interested[/td]\n        [td]Wait 75%[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [th]D[/th]\n        [td] 0[/td]\n        [td]Not what you need[/td]\n        [td]Wait 100%[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n\n🏅 Community Rating: [b] Very Positive [/b]\n🔎 Long Version Checklist ➜ [u][url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/expectationchecklist/discussions/1/1738883005311884039/]Reveal[/url][/u]\n📢 Disclaimer about Short Hours & English Error ➜ [u][url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/expectationchecklist/discussions/0/4594180031254224809/]Read Here[/url][/u]\n\n[quote]\n⚖️ iMeter {B} Worth a play, if you enjoy Teamwork Challenges with Puzzle.

Better played with friends. Really brilliant gameplay idea. I just hope it gets a final ending really soon!\n\nEdit: After reaching the ultimate end, I felt bit disappointed. The progress was just straight up boring and uninteresting after years of restarting again and again.\nVery fun game anyways\n- A lot of people's main complaint's seem to be about microtransactions. The game is perfectly playable without spending a dollar other than what you spent on the base game. And it's really not P2W. mostly aesthetic. Dedicated servers would be nice. but I feel they could fix this by better host migration. It is rather annoying when in a 4v4 and the host gets tilt and breaks the match by leaving, losing all the exp earned.\n\nTL;DR people are mad about spending extra money but want dedicated servers for free? =/\n\n*EDIT* after spending a few hours practicing, I now get told to kill myself on a regular basis in duels.\n\n11/10 Git Gud\n- One of the better RPG maker games i've seen and played, especially considering it was made on RPG Maker 2003. The beginning of the game was great and felt like there was a ton of potential, but a lot of the overworld mechanics were underutilized (jumping, swimming, orb flying). The writing was alright in the beginning, but started to turn into a bad fanfic in the middle/end of the game. The ending was... wholly unsatisfying and abrupt. It made very little sense, and did absolutely nothing to answer any questions asked at any point in the game, rather asking brand new questions and providing no resolution for any of the characters. You'll get about 10-14 hours of this game, which is kind of amazing for an RPG maker game, but honestly, steam has SOOOO many better titles available in this price range that unless you're into RPG maker, you should go elsewhere.\n- You know that feeling when you are hesitant to buy a game because you're worried you might waste your money on something that might be a crap game in the end, get boring, and not sure if you should believe all the ratings because you dont know if everyone has the same interests and likes as you? well this game is the bomb diggity, straight up. Made by the same people who made rollercoaster tycoon and man did they deliver on this. For me it's the small things in a game that matter and did they really take the time to make sure this was as polished as it could be. Not sure if anyone remembers when they announced another rollercoaster tycoon a while back, and everyone was super excyited to find out what it was, and it ended up being some dumbass phone app? Well imagine all that excyitment, but instead of them coming out with that stupid app they came out with this bad boy. This is exactly what everyone was wishing and hoping for (just different name). Do I reccomend you buy this game? hell yes. will it be exactly what you are wishing for when you fist clicked this game to see the game play and reviews? sure as cocks will. But will it be just as fun as the original?.... YOU BET YOUR MOMS TITS IT WILL BE. \n\nPROS:                                \nbeen one since 1990\n\nCons:\nYou'll never know how fun it is till you buy it.\n- BABA IS YOU\nGAME HAS PUZZLE\nPUZZLE IS CHALLENGE AND NOT UNFAIR\nPUZZLE IS FUN AND LOGIC\nGAME HAS MUSIC AND GRAPHIC\nMUSIC IS CHARMING\nGRAPHIC IS CHARMING AND CUTE\nGAME IS RECOMMEND \nGAME IS GOOD\nBUY IS WIN\n\n【グループB】\n- This game taught me about the diversity of cultures that our small little corner of the universe offers.\n\nThen it taught me to hate them all.\n- Wait. So you are telling me that I have to purchase this faction as well as US & OBERKOMANDO to play offline VS AI?? WTH is wrong with gaming companies nowadays?\n- A Visual Novel meets The Stanley Parable by way of Disco Elysium. This game contains a shocking amount of depth of content and thematics behind it's excellent voice acting and 3-colour sketchy visual style. Well worth a play if you're intrigued.\n- Portal is a first person puzzle platformer where you are testing science with portals guided by GLaDOS.\n\nThe game is a classic for a reason. It uses portals as the main puzzle mechanic and combines other mechanics with the portals such as falling and gaining momentum to launch at a higher speed through the other portal. The levels gradually build up with complexity, but are never too frustrating and half of them are done with access to only a single portal. The puzzles have great visual clarity with the mostly white colors and decent visual cues on how it should all work out.\n\nPortal has the classic Valve way of telling stories, as things are already happening before you get there. You are woken up to follow instructions for the testing purposes of GLaDOS, but you are also figuring out if maybe there isn't a role better suited that could fit you. It's an enjoyable mystery leading you on without forcing it's way in.\n\nGoing back from Portal 2 to Portal made me aware of the improvements to the overall gameplay. Exiting through portals in Portal makes the camera rotate in a weird way sometimes and the levels are generally designed to be slower pace than what Portal 2 offers.\n\nIf there is one thing I didn't enjoy, it's the advanced and challenge levels. Figuring the harder puzzles is one part of the challenge, but executing them relied on tight timings where the puzzle mechanics they rely on felt too clunky to be fun.\n\nFor achievement hunters:\nTwo playthroughs are required with 2 sets of collectibles, one of which requires to be done in one go, a few challenges through the story and completing the advanced and challenge levels that can be console cheesed. Guided here https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2008271826\n- In terms of originality, this gets a zero.  It's a Robotron clone with pretty graphics.  There have been many of these, and my personal favourite is the original Mutant Storm which is sadly no longer available to buy.  However, the graphics are really really pretty, and the game play is really really good.  So for being the best implementation of the Robotron idea to date it gets a big thumbs up!\n\nSuggestions where it could be improved:\n[list]\n    [*]Graphics are so pretty they do sometimes make it hard to see what's going on.  Maybe have a less pretty looking mode.\n    [*]4 player co-op\n    [*]Online co-op\n    [*]Ability to save/pause arcade mode so you don't have to play through entire game in single session.\n[/list]\n- I hate to do this, because the devs clearly put a lot of love into it, but I just can't give it the thumbs up.\n\nThe controls are mostly on point (slide jumping is a little weird), but the generated levels are what kills it for me. I've come to realize that getting through the hand-crafted levels is a good portion of what makes Mega Man so fun. This procedural generation simply isn't up to snuff. You just go right, occasionally going up or down to go right again. There's no nuance or thought required to go right, because most enemies can be ignored, and there are no real obstacles. \n\nIf you've got that itch, just replay a Mega Man game (Classic/X/Zero). You'll go through proper, hand-crafted levels.\n- I don't understand why everyone is saying to stay out of the house? I went inside, they were super nice loving and caring people. The dude that owns the place is a butcher and has all kinds of quality meat. We had BBQ and showed me around the wheat farm. And his grandma, she can't see or hear very well, but she's incredibly sweet. They're both looking after a baby that's ABSOLUTELY ADORABLE!\n\nI don't get what all the fuss is about, I enjoyed my visit.\n- This is a game that I have been looking forward to for at least 2 and a half years. I have wanted to have a game on the PC that had the elements of harvest moon (for the little bit I played of it), Animal crossing (<3) and Rune factory. I was super excited when I was approached by Leth (publishing manager at Chucklefish) at the beginning of December to help him and ConcernedApe (developer of the game) with bug testing and QA. 400+ hours later (off steam and on steam), I still love the game. \n\n[b]Farming.[/b] The farming is fantastic. It is to me one of the main elements of the game, and it's just a joy. Being able to design your farm any way you want it... yes please. Planning out what to buy every season, where to plant them, on top of the thrill of when you can harvest and reap on the gold... it's so enjoyable and addictive. \n\n[b]Fishing.[/b] The fishing is outstanding. From playing WoW and Runescape.. or any game with fishing, the fishing in Stardew Valley is so much fun. At first, the fishing is challenging, but as you progress your skill, you become a pro in no time.\n\n[b]Mining and combat.[/b] Mining and combat is incredible. Going deeper into the mines can be tough, but if you're prepared with your food and weapon in hand, you can fend off the creatures and get your sweet ore/minerals/gems that you want to bring back to your house and possibly hoard. (Hi, I'm Bexy, and i'm a hoarder.) \n\n[b]Social.[/b] Social interactions are great. Being able to become friends with the people in the town,  and eventually being able to get into relationships with people and having a family with them.. what's not to like about that? And what's great is that it gives great replayability because you can have different saves with different spouses! The backstory for each of the characters too is so in depth and well thought out, you will be silly if you don't shed a tear maybe once or twice. \n\n[b]Main story.[/b] The actual main story is well rewarding, and once you \"complete\" it, you can still continue on your adventures and farming life with no problems, hell you might even discover new things afterwards, I sure as hell did! \n\nYes, I was a tester for the game. Yes, I have played for ridiculous amounts of hours. It may feel like i'm being a bit overzealous with this. However you have to remember, I was a tester. I tested the crap out of every aspect with this game, even though there were massive game breaking bugs, errors, glitches, crashes. I still love this game. I reported many a bug, and ConcernedApe was quick to fix them. \n\nAnd that's the thing, not only is the game amazing, the developer is too. ConcernedApe works around the clock to make sure that bugs are fixed in quick time in order for us to have an amazing experience with this game. And that's true. The experience that you have with this game IS amazing. \n\nMinutes playing turn into hours. Hours turn into \"oh no it's time to sleep\".\nYou will forget about time. You will forget about sleep. You will forget that dinner was about 5 hours ago but you couldn't' remember because you were too busy trying to fight off 12 bats that were clobbering you inside the mines while trying to gather that 1 diamond waaaaay in the back. \n\nSo yes, I without a shadow of a doubt 150% recommend this game to anyone that wants to \"escape\" for days on end with what I am classifying as my #1 Game of 2016.\n- This is more of a personal opinion than a useful review, but I would like to share my experience with this game! At the beginning I was very disappointed... I was hoping for a Phoenix Wright competitor, but it wasn't even close! The investigation was so silly, the game doesn't let you leave the scene before you find all the clues, you can't \"weist\" your time going to places not related to the case and the trial doesn't start until you have all you need... the only way to fail is not having coordination to shoot the bullets xD The game takes you exactly where it wants.\nThe first trial was also so obvious I almost gave up playing. BUT THEN... things started to get strange. During my second trial I was \"that is what happened... I mean... I guess...\" and during the third trial I had no fucking idea what was going on D: The story got so deeper and full of details. Each chapter revealing new secrets, showing how complex the plot was!\nI realized that I shouldn't see Danganronpa as a poorly investigation game that wasn't that challenging, but as an amazing novel with such a rich story! The gameplay became secondarly compared to how envolved I was with the whole scenario! The further you go, more incredibly enjoyable it gets. So, for those who didn't like the game for this very reason, give a second chance with another point of view :) enjoy it's fabulous mysteries and you will not regret unreaviling it's secrets!\n- If you played the OG this is basically the same but with a few added side stories you can unlock as you complete different routes in the game. The extra dlc maybe would take you a bit over an hour to complete all of them if you speed through it, but does not have any optional dialogue so it's more of just some lore and extra character interactions. Still pretty solid dlc if you are a fan and want a little bit of extra stuff :)\n- Has combination of tight controls and well designed levels that makes platforming satisfying, excellent graphical style and music, as well as tons of unlockable content that will keep you playing even after finishing the story.\n\nVery solid platformer.\n\nThe only downside is there's no online coop; only local.\n- As a fan of Mimimi's Stealth Strategy Game,\nI love it so much, the operation system is getting smoother and more user-friendly comparing to Desperados III & Shadow Tactics.\nAlso I like how they added new elements to the game to make it more playable (E.g. Flexible team choice, character stories)\n\nThe only thing I don't like is the art.\nGame design is good but it'd be great if there's good looking characters...\n- Update circa Feb 2017: PLEASE READ!\n\nIt's been brought to my attention that there is a code for unlocking all the characters and stages in the game.  One of the main reasons I could not recommend this game at all on release was that, as far as I knew, it was not possible to unlock all single-player content without multiplayer modes (versus), which requires an extra controller.  As this is NOT the case, I can recommend this game if it is on sale (50% off or more, and it has been 75% off previously) and you look up the code.  If it matters, you will still need to fufill normal unlock conditions for achievements.\n\nThe game still sorely needs an online mode, has no AI for versus, and is not quite a pick-up and play title.  The two times I've returned to this game after a long absence, it has taken me a while to relearn the controls, an issue I don't frequently have with other games.  This may not be a problem if you play often enough, or with a controller.\n\nMy outdated review can be seen below\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you can gather 1 to 3 people for local multiplayer, then feel free to buy this game.\n\nHowever, if you plan to play this game by yourself, make sure you have a spare controller before purchasing this game.\n\nWhy?  Because even with a keyboard, a controller is required to play Versus mode, and certain content (at least 3 map sets and all 4 extra characters) can not be unlocked unless you can access Versus mode.\n\nIf you do not have a controller, you will not be able to unlock all single player content.\nIf you do not have a controller, you will not be able to unlock all the content in a game you paid for.\n\nI would change my stance on this game in the future if either:\n1)  The ability for a single player to fight against the AI in \"versus mode\"  is added\nor \n2) An online mulitplater mode is added  \nThe second option may be a little unreasonable, but the first isn't.\n\nEither of these would allow players to play versus mode without a controller, thus giving them the ability to unlock game content that is currently unaccessible with just a keyboard.\n- WHERE ARE MY OG DS FANS OF THIS GAME? REJOICE BRUDDAS!\n\nNo but seriously, I loved this game to DEATH when it first came out on the DS and to now see an HD version of this game on steam. It's quite a whiplash but a good one! To anyone who loves mystery/ detective games, YOU NEED TO GET THIS!!! Good story, soundtrack and gameplay <3 AHHHHHH!!!\n- Whoa. Wow. I was really impressed with this game. And really immersed too, where did those 20 hours even go...\n\nAt its core, TRI is a first-person puzzle platformer with relatively small levels jam-packed with secrets to find, on top of the main collectibles. The difficulty curve is pretty smooth, but steep; the game expects you to think outside of the box and be very aware of what you can and can't do. There's a ton of clever level design and puzzle design, and a lot of variety too. \n\nThere are a few minor flaws; chapter 13 is kind of ehh bad. Dying to acid or lasers makes you reload a save, which seems a bit much. Granted you'll end up saving a ton once you get to levels where you can die just so that doesn't happen, and usually it's only a minor inconvenience, but I don't see why it had to be that way. Oh well. There's also a few too many \"hidden behind fake tile\" secrets, but they still aren't that prevalent and most of them have some indication. \n\nOther than that? A lot to love. I really can't explain why it's great without spoiling puzzle solutions or the quirks of the mechanics, but it's well worth your time to play. Definitely would recommend, but it's not for everyone, that's for sure.\n- [b][i]AMID EVIL[/i] is very much [i]Quake[/i] 1 level design in a [i]Hexen[/i]/[i]Heretic[/i] universe.[/b] It's well done. We're a bit spoiled this year with outstanding '90s FPS shooters. Personally, I prefer both [i]Ion Maiden[/i] and [i]DUSK[/i] over this title for the following reasons:\n\n1) I find [i]AMID EVIL[/i] to be a bit generic in terms of theme; the fantasy setting could use a bit more to set it apart.\n\n2) I prefer real or low fantasy weapons/guns over wands and totally high fantasy weapons. Now, don't get it twisted - I appreciate that these high fantasy weapons exist, but yeah, they leave something to be desired. I miss reloading and all of that. \n\n3) The level design in [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is much more 'sprawling' (for lack of a better term) just like the original [i]Quake[/i]. Most levels are indoors in what feels like an underground compound (at the time of writing this review). I personally like the backwoods feel of [i]DUSK[/i], or the dystopian cityscape of [i]Ion Maiden[/i] far more. I want to look up at the sky in most levels.\n\n4) The enemy design is different than the other two games I mention, which is good - but they all mostly have a 'same' kind of feel. The enemies are all super fast, so most of your efforts are focused on running backwards while fending them off. It's fun, but gunplay isn't quite as fun as the other two games for this particular reason.\n\n5) The font and overall menu system definitely feels 'Early Access'. I know the font is being worked on, which is desperately needed. \n\n6) My favorite way to play the game is Endless mode - and I feel like that's a flaw in itself. It's the opposite for me with [i]DUSK[/i]. I want to fall in love with the campaign, but eh, there isn't really any story or anything all that interesting to suck me in. The secrets are super easy to find compared to the other two games, too.\n\n7) No multiplayer. Now, I really don't care about this - but who designs a game in this genre without building this in from the ground up? You know the community is going to whine about this. Questionable design decision to say the least.\n\n[b]Well, it sounds like I just dumped all over the game.[/b] Please don't get me wrong. [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is a welcome addition to the genre. The *great news* is that this is not just some reskin of [i]DUSK[/i] - it certainly is it's own thing. And that's really important. \n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+Fairly polished game for Early Access\n+It's the most modern version of the original [i]Quake[/i] we've seen this year\n+Well optimized\n+Lots of content right now\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-The universe is generic\n-No multiplayer\n-The font is too hard to read\n-Music is nothing to write home about\n-The secrets are easy, and there really aren't all that many of them\n-Weapons could use more 'oomph' to them; also we should be able to use the special ability when we want to as opposed to it autotriggering\n\n[b]I was psyched out of my mind for [i]AMID EVIL[/i] - and while it is certainly good - I think I'll be focused more on [i]DUSK[/i] and [i]Ion Maiden[/i].[/b] Because, let's face it, gaming time is valuable and we can't play everything.\n- SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT.\n\nAs the store page states, NOREN is supposedly a 'simple' keyfinding game. That would be true if there were any keys actually in the game, but as it stands it seems that NOREN is a simple abandoned shovelware game that's impossible to progress in, let alone beat. You play as some soldier in a massive, dark castle, equipped only with a dying lantern. The light fades quickly, and you can regain light slowly by... standing by a light source. That'd be simple enough if you weren't endlessly pursued by dinosaurs that are programmed with AI which knows your exact location at all times; three chomps and you're 'aparted' from the world, where you respawn with whatever amount of light and sanity you have left. Additionally, the translation attempt is abysmal at best. \n\nBoth NOREN and its developer, ThroneLab, should be banned from Steam. I do not blow the 'scam' whistle lightly, and I only do such when I am 100% certain of something actually being a scam. There are a handful of videos of this title on YouTube as well, with only one being over 5 minutes long. No one found a key. If evidence can be presented to me that there is in fact a way to progress in this game, I will rewrite this review. Until then, beware and stay vigilant.\n\n[h1]Rating: [b]0.0/5.0[/b] - WARNING.

There's a lot of useful lessons anyone can pick up from this.\n\nThe emotional issues it tackles are pretty grounded and somewhat refreshing to see in a game. There's a HUGE mystery element when it comes to the story. (which is sooo damn good mind you). But the conversations you have with the people in this game are just so real and cherishable, you could just wish these in-game days won't stop. \n\nThe small moments you have with family and friends in Night in the Woods are probably one of the most amazing experiences I ever had in a game\n\nPS: After finishing the story, I got all sappy and tear jerky that I went and called my mom to tell her that I love and miss her and stuff.. that's what this game is.\n\nUgh kill me. Im so corny. I love this feeling. So refreshing. f*ck off all of you.\n- This game is set to release in early October, but I definitely wouldn't buy it anytime soon. It's not ready. It's full of weird little errors, the mechanics and UI are clunky as hell, there's a lot of information you really need but don't get, the \"events\" are incredibly repetitive, half the time the wording is so bad you're left confused what's actually happening, even the basics aren't there- random capitalization, no consistency from panel to panel or objective to objective... This game needs another 6 months in EA.\n- very fun there is lots to do \nit runs well\nglitches are very funny\nable to download community made maps and mutators from workshop\ncan unlock different mutators as you play\nyour a goat\nyou do goat things\nyou can do non goat thing such as being a shopping cart or a microwave\nyou can also be a goat\n**Spoiler**\n[spoiler] Im a goat [/spoiler]\n\n GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!\n- This game is so good!

All of the dialogue is super natural and the relationship's progress really cute. I honestly can't believe this game is free\n- [h1]A Great Time [i]Killer[/i][/h1]\n\nSlayaway Camp is an enjoyable puzzle game that runs great and is well polished.

In fact, I've loved it since I was in highschool about 8 years ago. My friend and I used to play this game together all the time on my flashdrive. We were always discussing & trying to understand the ins-&-outs of the game and how to get a specific ending depending on what you did. Playing this brought me back to those good times in that library.\n\nThe OSTs are nostalgic, the gameplay is about the same and the artwork is amazing as ever(actually the graphics are much better with this remake).\nThe only complaint I have is that it lags at random times(though usually in the menu). The original IB on RPGMaker never did that.\nOverall I'm glad I bought this so I could support the Dev and thank them for all those years of entertainment-\nI just wish there wasn't so much lag over an RPGMaker game.\n- Remember when Doom 2016 released the multiplayer beta test first, and we rightfully worried the game would be a flop? Thankfully, the campaign instead blew us away.\n\nI enjoyed my first run through 2016, but only moderately so. In the original Dooms, if you never stop moving, enemies truly can never hit you. With 2016, however, enemies lead their shots if you move predictably. Also, if you leave line of sight, the demons will fire several more predict shots, in case you re-engage from the same vantage point.\n\nI failed to adapt initially. Instead, I blamed the game, claiming it felt unfair compared to the originals.\n\nThen, I stumbled upon Clockner's playthrough of Doom. He showed me a skill ceiling I never dreamed possible. Next came ByteMe's speedrun performance at QuakeCon 2019. I noticed when the demons charged their shots, he would at times hold still and bait for them to aim before dodging at the last second.\n\nThe excuses were off. Doom has transformed after 25 years. The enemies are now more intelligent (yet not overly so). I too needed to evolve.\n\nAs I took on my Ultra Nightmare run (over 3-4 months), I developed a deep knowledge of every level, and in the process, became fond of every inch, as if the entire UAC and Hell were my homes. UN felt like such an accomplishment. After that, I tried to take on an all runes/weapons/challenges mastered run (no grinding). I failed the first two times. With Eternal around a day or two away, I just completed this challenge on my third try. Personally, I leave satisfied with nothing left.\n\nI initially had gripes with 2016, only to learn the developers were one step ahead. When a team/game proves me wrong, I am loyal forever.\n\nDoom 2016 will now be uninstalled from my machine, never again to be reinstalled. May your thirst for blood never quench. And may we never need you again.\n\nTo me, Doom 2016 is also Eternal 🙏.\n- If Hayao Miyazaki directed a video game I feel like it'd be something like Owlboy. By which I mean; stunning visuals, incredible soundtrack and a wonderful story. The three intertwine so well that I'd consider it to be my Ocarina of Time for Pixel Platformers.\nAnd an indie game that's so damn beautiful it made me write my first review.\n- Know your History: \n\nMany of you will already know this, but this game has ties much deeper than you think. It's no secret that Bethesda's Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim had extended it's life through an extensive modding community. For decades, literally, ENBs, shaders, textures, companions, and even story-lines added THOUSANDS of hours to an already sizable game. One story-line mod was called \"The Forgotten City\".  Over the next few years since it's release, the mod had acquired awards such as the 2016 Australian Writers' Guild Award, Zero Period Top 5 Quest Mods of 2015, and others. It was an astounding mod that threw the dragon born into a deeply profound, well written, and engaging story. It was a staple for my personal mod list for years. I've played the Skyrim version countless times, but as soon as I saw this release I immediately bought this and booted it up. \nObviously this is nothing like the mod, both visually or engine wise, but the spirit of the game is still there. It's more defined, expanded, and developed. It deserves every award and accolade it's received. When I walked into the opening scene and fell down the tunnel I couldn't help but shake my head and smile as a wave of nostalgia mixed with new expectations flooded my mind:\n\n\"My god, they've done it.\" \n\nHere's to you, Modern Storyteller, all the best and more to come!\n- [h1]A game meant to bring back memories that is similar to Super Mario World on the SNES and it does this with relatively few gameplay and gimmick elements.

After all, it has to be ready for take-off in order for children everywhere to receive their presents on schedule. But a wicked troll blasts us out of the sky just as the test drive is about to end. He went over the line and wants to ruin Christmas for everyone on Earth. It is up to us to bring the troll to his senses and save Christmas for everyone.\n\nTLoS brings players to one world and six levels of great platforming that are reminiscent of Super Mario World (SNES) but simplified. There are only six levels total, one of which is a castle, before the final battle with the troll. The only difference is that we will be collecting chocolate cookies rather than the traditional yellow coins. We also lose part of our cloak when we are injured, so it's not uncommon for you to find yourself jumping through the levels wearing nothing but red boxer shorts. For instance, red blocks can give you a new coat, which means extra life, or Santa socks and hats, which give a power-up or simply chocolate cookies. The power-up allows you to throw stones as if you had collected the Fire Flower from Super Mario, and that's about it. TLoS also offers a 2-4 co-op player mode, in which players will be able to work together to complete this short and family-friendly adventure.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3009359595\n\nSimilar to Super Mario World, you walk to a level to choose them in the Overworld. Once we reach a certain level, we are allowed to walk, leap, and even sprint. Additionally, there are other indications on the screen that show you how many cookies you have already gathered and how much time is remaining to finish the level. We get an extra life when 100 cookies are collected. We can activate a checkpoint about halfway through the level to pick up exactly where the checkpoint was reached, instead of having to do the entire level all over again. The game also features side-scrolling and underwater levels. The only problem is that if you quit at level three, close the game and start again, you have to start from level one, so you have to play the game in one go. This means that there are no save points or \"save states\". Considering the length of the game, this is not a big deal, but it's still \"annoying\".\n\n[h3] My Specs [/h3]\n\n[code]CPU: i9 9900k\nGPU: RTX 2080 Ti\nRAM: DDR4 32 GB RAM\nOS: Win10\nResolution: 1440p @144hz\n[/code]\n\n[h3] Conclusion [/h3]\n\nWe are all hoping that Nintendo will release their IPs on Steam so that we can play with them one more time. We may all agree, based on experience, that this is probably never going to happen, but Indie developers are there to make it happen. To avoid the tedious teachings at school, you used to be able to play these types of games in class on the usual Flash Player websites, and now you can play them on Steam. Though it's not a masterpiece, it's extremely minimalistic, and it's unquestionably too short, the 20 minutes I spent playing it were nevertheless a lot of fun, especially because the platforming is accurate and not wonky at all. Just remember, it's very minimalistic and may be too minimalistic for some, but if that doesn't bother you, feel free to go ahead and try it out.\n\nIt would be my personal highlight if there were additional levels, more secret exits, more power-up alternatives, and more hours of overall playtime.\n\n[h2] Final Verdict: 8/10 A typical gas station snack that turns out to be a surprisingly good one.🎅 [/h2]\n- oh good god how do i remove things from my library\n- Do you kinda like 4X games, but mostly the first 2-3 hours of the game where you're exploring and hacking a basic civilization out of the wilderness and desperately fending off natural threats while trying to keep people fed and productive? If so, this game is for you. Nice tight gameplay loop where things never get stagnant for too long; always novel threats and opportunities, and you're not tied to any one settlement for very long, so victory and defeat alike are more temporary. Not to mention a really astounding amount of fun, polished content for an early access game! Eremite, Hooded Horse, I salute you.\n- I reviewed the original Mark of the Ninja more than 4 years ago. I liked its stealth-based gameplay approach and praised the learning curve experienced throughout the story. I bought the [i]Special Edition[/i] which practically meant an add-on with some more levels, a custom and the option to replay the entire game in commentary mode. \n\nYou know some games get re-released due to the availability of a new console generation. This [i]Remastered[/i] edition is what was made available for PS4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch users not long ago. We, PC gamers (who already own the original Mark of the Ninja), can get this version free-of-charge in our library.\n\nThere's not much to say, really. I do not have a 4K display so this higher resolution I cannot enjoy. Compressed in-game art or not the original already looked very good. But the creators confirmed this will give us an enhanced experience even under 1080p resolution. \n\nWell, I did complete the game once again as this is how much I love MoN. I recommend that you do the same.\n\nPS: It may be possible that you are required to have the special edition of the original version to get the remastered version.\n- I waited 12+ years for a proper sequel to A Crack in Time (yes i know the other games came out but tbh they didn't do much for me) for it only to come out for the PS5. Unfortunately, I wasn't getting a new console for just one game. \n\nNow, two years later I'm playing it on the PC.  While surreal, I am super glad they ported this series to a different platform, and the game was totally worth the wait.\n\nThe port by Nixxes ran very nice for me. I had a few hitches in the dimensional portal scenes, and one crash in a total of 12hrs of playtime. I do understand that some people are having issues and that does suck & does not disqualify their experiences, however, It is not even close to how bad TLOU Pt.1's port was.  \n\nIt's another Insomniac banger, and if you've played any of their games you already know whats up. I beat the game in 12 hrs on the 2nd to last difficulty grabbing whatever side content/collectibles I could before the story captivated me. As is tradition, there is a NG+ mode (haven't touched yet) and I look forward to trying it. I'll probably update the review at that point, but the games are always repayable due to their collect-a-thon nature, that and being so damn fun you have a dumb ear-to-ear smile for all of the playtime.  \n \nIf you enjoyed the Ratchet and Clank games in the past, its way more of that + the dimensional gimmick which is really well done and very neat tech wise. I love the new movement features and Rivet is a very good addition to the cast. I hope she stays relevant in the story in the future. Game feels super good to play as well, weapons are great as always. The writing is still funny and enjoyable. It's just a good time, and I highly recommend it, even at full price.\n\nLastly, I would like to direct a message to Sony/PS Studios/Insomniac Games:\nPLEASE PORT THE OTHER AND OLDER R&C GAMES PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE IPELASE PLs I WILL PAY $70\n- Very calm game with heartwarming moments. Better played with friends. Really brilliant gameplay idea. I just hope it gets a final ending really soon!\n\nEdit: After reaching the ultimate end, I felt bit disappointed. The progress was just straight up boring and uninteresting after years of restarting again and again.\nVery fun game anyways\n- From my nine year old: \"We like that every screen you can stop and color, and if you don't want to color there is a story part to it. We really like to do both; there are puzzles, different colors and different sections. I would definitely recommend this game for five and up year olds.\"\n- While still a work very much in progress, Nuclear Throne is currently one of my favorite games. It's a roguelike dungeon crawler with heavy \"bullet-hell\" elements and a little RPG sprinkled on top. When you begin a session of Nuclear Throne, you choose from one of several well-designed & freakish \"mutants\", each with their own special attributes which, in itself, does much to add variety (there's also a random-select option which is a fun idea in this particular case). The goal of each stage is to exterminate all of the enemies. After doing so, a portal opens which takes your mutant freak to the next level. There are a great many weapons with which to inflict meyhem on your adversaries. As you gain experience points, in the form of green goo earned by killing enemies & also found in cache jars, you'll be able to choose new persistent perks for your character (such as more HP or certain weapons doing more damage). Every so-often, you'll encounter a boss. The bosses tend to pop in during the height of an already-in-progress battle which makes beating them all-the-more difficult & hectic.\n\nOriginally, this game did not have controller support which was a great disappointment (though I had been ejoying it anyway, using the keyboard and mouse). However, a recent update rectified this and the gameplay using a dual-analog controller (such as that of the Xbox 360) is just fantastic. Like Ultratron before it (another very similar game which is also worth a look; I also wrote a review for it, if you're interested in checking it out), Nuclear Throne throws you straight back to the arcades of yore and plops you in front of a Smash TV cabinet.\n\nAs a roguelike dungeon-crawler, the replay value is extremely high (due to the fact that the level and enemy layout is totally different from one session to the next). The rather extreme difficulty doesn't hurt either, as playing entails dying and thus restarting... a lot. Fortunately, said difficulty isn't of the variety that compels you to smash your controller/keyboard in frustration. Every death feels like the fault lay squarely on *your* shoulders (if only you had moved to dodge a little faster or conserved ammo a little better!), as opposed to the game feeling like it's cheating. Another stand-out feature which I think I need to bring up is the soundtrack. ...Just wow! Nuclear Throne's score is totally original and extremely surreal. It goes *miles* in lending its own atmosphere to the game. \n\nSome might consider the current price of $12.99 to be just a *little* steep for a game in this class, but considering how well it's made overall and the fun I've gotten from it (especially being in its currently pre-release/beta state), I consider it to be well worth the price. As of the time of this writing, the developer(s) is very active and updates are coming quite frequently.\n\nUPDATE 01/12/16: I hadn't played this game in quite a while (at least 6+ months) and I wanted to check out the progress that the devs have made, etc. Well... The game starts but as soon as I select a character, it totally locks up. I can't play it at all. To make matters worse, I've heard that the devs have since \"abandoned\" development of this game (so it's not likely that whatever is causing the crashes for me is going to be fixed any time soon - or ever). Bummer man. I loved this game...\n- I am a day one player who quit the game within a few days. After coming back after almost 2 years, I am shocked and surprised. The overall improvement is great, quests are not bothering you. Story and atmosphere is hooking you up and the overall experience is good. Leveling up is easy and also you are not struggling as in most MMOs.\n\nDespite the past of the game, I think it is worth trying.\n- This game is set to release in early October, but I definitely wouldn't buy it anytime soon. It's not ready. It's full of weird little errors, the mechanics and UI are clunky as hell, there's a lot of information you really need but don't get, the \"events\" are incredibly repetitive, half the time the wording is so bad you're left confused what's actually happening, even the basics aren't there- random capitalization, no consistency from panel to panel or objective to objective... This game needs another 6 months in EA.\n- [h1]The Good[/h1]\n- Cop System.\n- Best progression in a need for speed game in years.\n- Genuinely fun and engaging, builds on the foundation of nfs2015 while taking the good mechanics from payback to make a compelling game. If the need for speed hype was still around people would stop asking for most wanted again because want it or not this is it, even if it falls short on a few cases.\n- Feel of \"speed\".\n- Insanely beautiful, runs super well, amazing lighting. Looks good on both day and night.\n- Day and night have different purposes in the game, and the fact you can choose is pretty cool as well. You can sweat if you want or if you want just races you can stay in the day.\n- Visual customization with community decals, let's go!\n- Online entirely optional, is kind of the same as nfs2015 instead of payback having the singleplayer map but instead allowing free roam drivers which is pretty cool\n- Car profiles like we have in forza, no more taking a racing car into the offroad! They actually perform as they should!\n- Good map\n- Crossplay\n- Character customization\n\n[h1]The Bad[/h1]\n- Cop System. It has a lot of rough edges that will piss you off. Yes it's the difficulty players wanted but also too much rubberbanding, \"rhino incoming\" taking half your screen not actually letting you see the rhino, game basically requiring you to abuse ramps because there's no proper way to actually deal with cops, etc.\n- Story is short and shitty. Payback as mid as it was did the \"corrupt cop\" storyline better\n- Progression system is taken back by the included powerful starter cars which came from the deluxe edition. It's fine since it's included but I hate how good features are destroyed with certain executive decisions\n- No post-release support, as it's the case with EA games\n- Need origin to play\n- Lots of bugs\n\n[h1]Neutral[/h1]\n- Overall teenager aesthetic. I like the neon style, but the overall teenager stuff and spanish characters (which are here because of the la casa de papel trend) just don't click with me. I just cringe all over the marketing material and how the characters engage\n- 21:9 support is fine not considering the map which doesn't scale to 21:9 unfortunately\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nThis is it boys. Need for speed is back!\n- I'm gonna be talking about the game in very broad strokes so don't worry about spoilers. \n\nI'm bananas about the Dead Space series. The experience of playing the original in 2009 or so left a massive impression on me and I think this is overall a pretty fantastic update. I've played the original [strike] trilogy [/strike] duology to death on every system, listened to stuff, looked at stuff, everything. So as someone who has Nicole's monologue burnt into the back of my eyelids, I was pretty sceptical Motive would be able to win me over with Dead Space 23. I was very pleasantly surprised, though. It's clear a lot of love and care went into refining Dead Space for the remake and in many ways I find these refinements make the setting, characters, and mysteries all a lot more compelling. \n\nOn the lead up to release there was an IGN series of short interviews with developers, artists, writers, etc working on the remake. It was really fascinating hearing about how they were approaching different aspects of the project, there's a lot of interesting insights about the aesthetic and thematic goals of the game in there that get me really craving a Dead Space 23 art book. If you're sceptical about Dead Space 23, I think they're worth a watch. It's really striking how thoughtful they've been in creating their take on Dead Space and I don't think their efforts deserve to go so easily overlooked. If you're really interested in the artistry of the series I'd also highly recommend The Art of Dead Space, it's a great book and an amazing collection of art that really lays bare the core identity of the series. It's been a great companion piece to Dead Space 23.  I think a lot of people have been comparing the choices and artistic aims of the original team and the new devs in bad faith, I really can't see anything but reverence for the source material here. I'd also say that the differences that are there are interesting and well worth exploring!\n\nI'm also glad Dead Space has room to breathe again, EA really pushed the extended universe the first time around and I'm glad to see that mistake hasn't been repeated. I'm not someone who's super into lore, I like finding extra information that re-contextualises things in cool ways but this extended universe stuff can get pretty silly. There were animated movies, books, tie-in games, a Wii rail shooter (which I enjoyed) and most of it just served to undermine the setting and the horror for me. That isn't to say the remake shies away from its roots because it absolutely doesn't, there's an entire New Game+ path that I think incorporates a direct reference to one of the extended universe novels. If you're a lorehead you'll definitely recognise familiar names in text logs, even very forgettable characters get some mentions in. I really love this about the remake, it reincorporates a lot of this disparate stuff into more of a coherent whole. \n\nI think my favourite addition is the AI director that manages encounters and atmospheric effects. Dead Space is a game that invokes hypervigilance, I think that's part of what makes the series so compelling. You're always alert, always listening and watching, always looking over your shoulder. It has an intensity that I feel is absolutely unmatched. With the AI director in the mix that feeling is sharper than ever. You can't rely on memory alone to get you through now. Yeah, you can still memorise spawns and there are still an abundance of scripted encounters but you can never safely bet you know what's coming and when. Sometimes the lights will flicker and steam will hiss from the pipes- nothing. But sometimes a pregnant and most of a divider will be waiting for you right by the shop. You can truly never assume you're safe, that feeling is no longer illusory as it was in Dead Space 2008. I think that's great. I also found that the director would spawn interesting combinations of enemy types which is cool, it went a long way to making the threat more unpredictable. \n\nI never really experienced any of the performance issues everyone else is talking about so I think my main issue with the game is very petty. I flat out do not like the redesign of the Soldier rig. They look like those guys who're really into Mandalorian themed tactical gear and Punisher stuff. So, yeah, not sure if that's an intentional update to reflect reality but, aesthetically speaking, I found it very jarring. \n\nI think this is a very solid foundation to build on to bring back the Dead Space series. I hope in the future there might be more challenge modes, higher difficulties, more unlockable suits. Most of all though I hope Motive, like their predecessors, take some pointers from the Resident Evil games. I'm a big fan of the records system in the recent Resident Evil titles. It contributes enormously to replayability and it's neat getting to examine all the models, animations, concept art, all the good stuff. As someone who likes crafts and fan projects, something like that would be indispensable. it's all work that very much deserves to be admired, too. Some of the detail on the necromorphs is ludicrous. A records system would also be a great excuse to do wild runs like beating the game without healing or opening the shop. Just give me a reason, Motive.\n\nThere are thousands of things about this remake that I could just keep gushing about. Maybe I'll update this review over time and do just that (I have). But I hope for now this review has gone some way to convincing you to try out Dead Space. \n\nTanya Clarke killed it as Nicole, too.\n- A simple but detailed explanation of why, after having played both versions, I prefer Definitive Edition (DE) instead of 2013 Edition:\n\n-2013 Edition's farms don't automatically re-seed, forcing you to either order your villagers to re-seed them, or to mash the \"queue re-seed\" button in the mill. In DE, you can set the mills to automatically re-seed.\n-Definitive Edition lets you shift-click construction orders just like in 2013 Edition, but in the latter, the villager will move to build the last building you placed down. If you order several buildings, they will stop constructing the building they're already working on to go build the new one. In DE they will wait to finish the first building before starting on the next one.\n-2013 Edition's unit sprites are very pixelly and hard to distinguish one type of infantry unit from another, and to a lesser extent, one team from another. DE's graphics are much clearer so it is very easy to distinguish unit type/team.\n-Definitive Edition is far, FAR more customizable than 2013 Edition. Not just with the settings (graphics, UI, and controls are much more changeable) but especially with creating a game, namely win conditions, starting conditions, map sizes, unit restrictions, etc. You can adjust many more settings to make a new game into whatever kind of scenario you want. Also you can see what the map types actually look like in DE.\n-Definitive Edition has noticeably better pathfinding than 2013 Edition.\n-In DE you can zoom in and out. In 2013 Edition you can't.\n-In DE you can queue build orders while simultaneously upgrading the building. In 2013 Edition you can't even see any build options while a building is in the middle of upgrading.\n-In DE you can tell scouts to automatically scout out the map.\n-In DE the HUD shows you how many villagers are working on each resource. 2013 Edition does not do this, you have to play hide and seek with each one to count them.\n-The soundtrack for DE has more faction-specific songs, as well as less repetitive music. Both game's soundtracks are good, but I find having the DE soundtrack playing in the background to be more enjoyable. This point is pure preference.\n-2013 Edition's graphics are nice if you enjoy the old-school style, but DE's graphics are significantly easier on the eyes and prettier.\n-Definitive Edition has more civilizations.\n-Definitive Edition is just as moddable and has a very passionate modding community.\n-Definitive Edition seems to have more balanced gameplay.\n- [I received this product for free from a giveaway]. Only played for a short time, but sheesh, it's a bit of a mess both visually and gameplay wise. There's not much I can really say that would differ from what's shown in the trailer (rather crude MS-paint looking drawings with a few short looping backgrounds). You jump when moving right or left, flappy-bird esque, you dodge stuff going across the screen and from the top, which is a bit boring to me, but some may enjoy it more. You also have to go out of the screen to dodge sometimes, but also if you go too far out (who knows how far) you'll die as well. It might be an okay time waster for free (like old flash games), but I wouldn't recommend spending your money on this.\n- I have always wanted to play Resdient Evil 4, and I wanted to play this game so badly.  I am giving a negative review simply because the games FPS on the PC are bad, that could be because of Windows 10 because I heared rumors that the game does not run well on it and such, so that could be the problem.   Another problem I faced is the lip sync is dealyed when it's on the cutscenes so that makes everything slow and such.  The gameplay from what I seen however is pretty great and I think Resdient Evil 4 is a great game, but this port is not, get it for the GC, Will, PS2, or any of the consloes that has this game.\n- I appreciate the sincerity of Jusant. You can tell its creators have placed genuine care into their product, which has made the experience of playing it joyful and kind.\nThe visuals are stunning, the mechanics are not overwhelming, the soundtrack is soothing, and the puzzles are not frustrating. A great climbing game all around with an easy-to-follow yet gripping narrative. \nHopefully, Ukrainian localization will also be added soon.\n\n- SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT.\n\nAs the store page states, NOREN is supposedly a 'simple' keyfinding game. That would be true if there were any keys actually in the game, but as it stands it seems that NOREN is a simple abandoned shovelware game that's impossible to progress in, let alone beat. You play as some soldier in a massive, dark castle, equipped only with a dying lantern. The light fades quickly, and you can regain light slowly by... standing by a light source. That'd be simple enough if you weren't endlessly pursued by dinosaurs that are programmed with AI which knows your exact location at all times; three chomps and you're 'aparted' from the world, where you respawn with whatever amount of light and sanity you have left. Additionally, the translation attempt is abysmal at best. \n\nBoth NOREN and its developer, ThroneLab, should be banned from Steam. I do not blow the 'scam' whistle lightly, and I only do such when I am 100% certain of something actually being a scam. There are a handful of videos of this title on YouTube as well, with only one being over 5 minutes long. No one found a key. If evidence can be presented to me that there is in fact a way to progress in this game, I will rewrite this review. Until then, beware and stay vigilant.\n\n[h1]Rating: [b]0.0/5.0[/b] - WARNING. Scam developer. Abandon all hope, ye who enter.[/h1]\nThe Horror Network [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28221963/]Curator[/url] | [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thehorrornetwork]Group[/url] Click for Gore\n- I would give this a mixed rating if I could. \nThe story is told in such a boring way that it's hard to stay invested. You run to one person, listen to a cutscene, or more likely read a cutscene, than go to another person to talk to. Sometimes you fight one guy but mostly it's pretty dull. There is very little gameplay in the overland content and everything plays like a bad visual novel.\n\nAAR, the first MSQ is just one fetch quest after the other with little story in it. Oh there is some story there, but it's not great. The characters are shallow with few expectations, both the supporting cast and villains. \n\nHeavensward, the expansion I got through before my time ran out, is better than ARR but not that enjoyable. There were parts I like (not to give spoilers, it was the part where you go on a “journey”) Sadly, that part of the expansion was far too short. Than the story precedes to shove itself up it’s own ass as it becomes fixated on one part of the lore. [spoiler]I don’t give a damn how the war started! It was a thousand years ago.[/spoiler]\nPro:\n-If you like story, and only story, you will like this game.\n-A lot of content\n-Trial fights. (Good boss fights without the boring part of dungeons)\n\nCons:\n-Little in the way of gameplay outside of dungeons and trials \n-ARR is a slog and not worth reading. Skip as fast as you can and just watch a recap video.\n-dungeons are locked behind the story and not unlocked as you level up.\n-The story is on the lower end of other final fantasy games.\n-Lalafells are in the game. People who play this race are degenerates.\n- And that's it, after 278 hours of play, the adventure is over... \nThis type of game that you wish you could forget so you could rediscover it like the 1st time, where you discover everything, a bit like a child\nIt's a game made with passion for video games, to tell a story, to make the player laugh too, and to make him a little melancholic or horrified or even sickened sometimes\n\n[u]Divinity OS 2 will have marked my young adult life[/u], like Sonic and megadrive games, Pokémon, FFTactics, Zelda and gameboy / gamecube games, Warcraft3 (TT), or Mass Effect and other PC games did in my childhood and adolescence (I surely forget so much excellent games)\n\nIt's a 20/20 for me. The work is titanic. The game is really made with passion. The studio is very talented.\n\nSo when Steam asks me [i]\"Do you recommend this game\"[/i], I say:\nYes! Because this is where you feel that video games are an experience, an adventure to live! \nI went through Rivellion with my buddy, like I went through Kanto (Pokémon), or Ivalice in FF Tactics as a kid!\n\n\n[u][b]Atmosphere:[/b][/u]\nMany of us probably remember our adventures in Pokémon or other games in our childhood.

And exhilarating hehehe\n\n\n[u][b]Gameplay:[/b][/u]\nA 3D tactical turn-based game, to play with friends. Really ! Don't play this game alone, I'm sure that with at least 1 buddy (or 3!), you will exploit the game to its full potential!\n\nAlso, [u]you can change your skills and class at any moment in the game[/u], it's very flexible ! I played rogue all my game, and in the last chapiter, I decided to play with spear and War skills ! I really enjoyed being able to switch like this, as I want ! The game want you to take FUN, not \"suffering\" your \"bad\" class choices !\n\nToo bad, I don't know anyone who is ready to take on the role of a GM (Game Master), to live a personalized campaign! Because it is a mode apart from the main campaign!\n\n\n[u][b]Music:[/b][/u]\nExtremely good and fits perfectly with the atmosphere of the game. This kind of OST that we listen to when we work and that makes us live our adventures again when the song becomes EPIC!\n\n\n[u][b]In summary:[/b][/u]\nTitanic content, assured re-playability for those who wish to know what would have happened if they had answered something else than \"FIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT\", and I repeat, the fact of being able to play with friends makes the game so much more pleasant to do!\n\n\n[b]*Sob*[/b]\nBut no, I'm not crying... I'm just allergic to emotions!\n\nI would like so much to forget this game to be able to rediscover it\n\nPlease play it, at least give it a try, and let yourself be immersed in Div's world!\n\nIn our case, we will do it again in HARDCORE mode !\n\nPeace guys !\n- Volition ups the silly, and adds super powers, but loses a little something along the way.\n\nI loved Saint's Row: the Third, and by all rights should have loved IV as well, but I mostly just liked it. The set up was fun, and seemed to up the ante again, but then you get the presidency ripped away from you almost immediately (without even seeing the consequences of your first pushed legislation!). Placing the game in a virtual city for the most part with the only real characters being on your space ship, really kinda seemed to gut the game. Even when [spoiler]the world gets destroyed[/spoiler], a detached, \"meh\" was all I could muster. The humor is there, but it's mostly better in the DLC. The radio stations feel kind of underwhelming without DJs.\n\nFinally all the fun of collecting and customizing various interesting cars, and finding ways to climb or fall to interesting places with a stolen plane/parachute are gutted with the inclusion of super powers. Also, the super powers make gunplay, leveling any of your other stuff, and pretty much every mechanic carried over from Saints Row: the Third obsolete.\n\nIf you get this game, do yourself a favor and make sure you get all the DLC where most of the real fun is. Is it as good as the previous Saints Row? I don't think so, but I still recommend getting it and playing through it. It is a lot of fun, and I love the 50's break out scenario at the beginning.\n\nStacey's thoughts:\nStill awaiting DLC with Jane Austin and the D*ldo Bat. Can somebody make this, for, uhh, scientific purposes.\n- Micromanage your 90%+ minority space colony simulator 2017\n\nSeriously, when choosing my starting colonists I had to reroll 15-20 times per colonist to get a white male colonist. It's almost like this game was made for Swedens' liberal party or something\n\n0/10 for feminista multi-kulti propaganda\n- This game is like cocaine. \nI always tell myself just one more, then im done. I'll do homework. I'll sleep. I'll eat something. \nBut you know what? That last death was cheap, I'll do one more to make up for it. I just need 1000 gold for that upgrade, I'll just do one more to get it. Always just one more. \n\nThings I like:\n\n+Strong RPG Progression - Gold from your run can be spent on stats, equipment, abilities, etc. making multiple runs and longer runs more rewarding.\n\n+The game is witty and has flavor. -- there are various conditions your new characters can have such as being blind, gay or having a fear of chickens, amongst many, many others. Dying is in this sense, pretty fun. The writing has a lot of charm!\n\n+The controls are very tight -- this game has good controls. It's easy to do what you want, which is good because it's very tough and you will die a lot.\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n- The bosses in new game plus don't get harder -- As you progress into new game + or ++ or +++ and beyond, the bosses don't scale well, despite the general enemies leveling up to basically become bosses themselves. Not a huge deal, but it's the only negative I have.\n\nThen at some point you realize you've beaten the game, Thankfully there is a new game plus.\nMaybe just one more playthrough...\n- Black Mesa is a fantastic remake of the Original Valve classic and one of the greatest of all time video games, Half-Life.  This sci-fi classic FPS has you take on what might seem like a hum-drum day in the life of an experimental physicist, but things go quite off rails when experimenting with a strange material sample from an even stranger dude in a suit. \n\nAfter a while (and shooting a lot of aliens and bashing their heads in with a crowbar) you'll save the world... but now Black Mesa lets you do this with dramatically updated graphics, 4K support and a plethora of visual tweaks so you can rest assured this will run great on any gaming rig. \n\nA must have for big fans of Half-Life or gamers who are new to the scene and never got to play the original.   When on sale, of course!\n- I remembered when I was 8, back then I used to play this on my PS3. It was one of the first RPG games i've ever played aside from Pokemon on GameBoy / Nintendo DS. This game made me feel like I'm in an another world back then. I had dreams of my companion and Drippy. It was such a nostalgic moment when I opened this game, and I was abit sad because I wished that I could turn back time and finish this game when I was a kid. I wasn't able to finish it at that time due to my brother taking away the PS3 overseas. Because now, after getting older, there are so many responsibilities that I must hold on to. Playing games like this during childhood truly changes the vibe of experiencing it. Now I only got a glimpse of it when I opened it for an hour or so. Maybe one day I'll finish this game, once I'm free from reality.\n- it's a shame but i honestly cannot recommend this game if you are a disabled person, i wasn't that far into the game when my character started panicking apon seeing a disabled person [person with leg braces] and then gets a \"no good answer\" bit of dialog and all the options are saying something wrong or saying nothing, trying to go with the least bad option aside from saying nothing since i know as a disabled person myself [i'm a wheelchair user] it can be pretty upsetting getting people just randomly stare at me and at least when they say something slightly wrong they are engaging with me as a person, my character then proceeds to talk abt what an \"inspiration\" it is 2 c a disabled person living their life,,, not exaggerating when i say i let my head hit the desk, closed the game and uninstalled, i understand that this is probably put in the game to be a teachable moment for the able bodied audience but ironically in trying to educate about us disabled people they then made the assumption that no disabled people would be playing their game as there is no option to make your character disabled or even to make them remotely aware of disability and ended up just making the experience awful for the disabled gamers they seem to be trying to help\n- The game is very good, it's fun and had everything to be a great success, but unfortunately because the anti-piracy, the game doesn't work well, even above 100 fps it feels lag, the game stutters, a strange gameplay.\n\nJust REMOVE DENUVO and the game will have the deserved success.\n\nUnfortunately, they still haven't realized that those who pirate, don't spend money with or without protection, and those who pay like us, have a game with problems.\n\nA good game doesn't need protection to sell, just be good, simple as that.\n- A fun game for drinking parties, take a shot every time you feel like you just wasted 19 cents.\n- owned the original from all the way back in 2014\nloved it tons, even more than RoR2\nsaw RoRR get teased on twitter, was there for its release, thought to myself,\n\"i don't need this, i can just play the ror from 2013, i don't know how to feel about this new one, is it really just the same game again?\"\n\nand then i saw someone grab an item i've never seen before, while playing as a character i've never seen before, on a map layout i've never seen before, using alternate abilities to what was baseline for that character to fight an enemy i've never seen before, and then activate a shrine of the mountain from ror2, and then while doing the teleporter fight they activated a bunch of new machines that turned drones into items and activated a specific equipment for a fee... and then i saw that you can just opt out of whatever you don't like about any of that, at any time!\n\nwhat's not to love about that??\n- This is somehow the only game where you can play as an anti-fascist faction in Nazi Germany, drive the Nazis into the ocean, kill Hitler and reclaim Germany as a democracy, and that's somehow the most boring possible outcome.\n- This game is really special. I'm a 50 year old man with an emotional structure made largely of mud and thumbtacks, and I had to bite the inside of my jaw in a parts to keep from tearing up. \n\nMany people seem to equate an \"adult game\" with gore and violence or explicit imagery. Nothing wrong with those types of games, I have and will continue to enjoy them. This game explores mature themes on relationships and mortality and doesn't pull any punches, without being cheap or manipulative. In that sense, its the most adult game I've ever played. \n\nI won't ever forget it. If this sounds like something you'd be interested in, stop reading and buy it. Its a slow burn, and you won't be invested until you've spent some time with the characters in the story. In the end, the payoff is tremendous.\n- I cannot belive the Q_Q from the negative reviews... so many spoiled little brats or total internet nooobs that do not know any better...... just mind boggling...... beyond words......\n\nGreat game even for early access, spent all my time so far solo on my own PVE solo game, will be playing with my friend(s) later.... a few hit box detection issues, if you load your bow and abort you will have the arrow in your hand no matter what you try and do, even with the axe in your hand the arrow will still be there til death... so just minior little things like that so far... \n\nFantastic graphics, I have everything on ultra and no issues, makes for some really great screenshots.... \n\nNo nudity, partial nudity (topless and loin cloth), and full nudity... tastful nudity as in \"female full nudes are especially lovely and artful\", cannot really say the same for the male character nudes however..... may have seen some.... questionable gifs or images floating around already... so I think that side of thing could have been take care of a bit better than that and made more tasteful since some images are \"questionable\" and quite Porographic... so that will leave a nasty impression of the game for many hopful customers and a stain on the Conan universe....\n\nHad little or no issues with buildings... I built a 3 story houe, last top room was 2 blocks high so do not feel cramped... I built a good long bridge to a big high wide rock, took about 4 pillers and they were about 4-5 blocked high and about 3-4 blocks apart... so good bridges are very possible to keep high and out of danger from NPCs at least and to make good use of tall rocks for base extentions... one issue I have is with stairs, you cannot have a ceiling block and a hole for the starts otherwise you head with get stuck and you cannot pass up the stairs... but you can crouch for a sec and go up the stairs... so a minior bug\n\nSooooo much potential for this game, sooooo many possibilities for this game, the sky is the limit... Devs are on the RIGHT TRACK !!.... I love the total freedom for those that want PvE or those that want PvP, many server configurations to play with to how you like, if you play solo you can even play around with the Admin features and go nuts building amazing buildings, spawn NPCs of all types and numbers.... I love the freedom, many games do not give you this much freedom to play how you want to play and that is how things should be....\n\nGood work Devs.... I was a big Fan of AoC and I was there on the first day and many months, but the combat mechanics in that game got boring fast... this game is simple and I dont think it should get much complex than it is now... so it is a good system\n\n\n- Please please please give this one a try, especially if you're a fan of existentialism, bittersweet stories, cyberpunk dystopias, gambling with your life every day, living life one step at a time, the small things that matter, cats and feeling like sh!t, but in a good way\n- WARNING. This game is pure drug. Don't buy unless You have no kids, no wife and You have a lot free time. I mean thousands of hours.\n\nYour brain will turn into a machine calculating the optimal use of all available resources on the map, there are hundreds of them and each discovery brings new threats from the beautiful mother nature. At some point You may experience unexpected dreams about high tech and well tuned factories.\n\nEarly Access in this case means something similar to never ending story. When You think \"I have done everything\" new update shows up and You're starting doing mess again.\n\nI can only have reservations about the multiplayer mode, where there are funny glitches, disappearing objects, self-propelled vehicles, lack of character synchronization, etc. However, this does not prevent having continuous fun in the co-op mode.\n\nI hope You like it so much as I did.\n\nEDIT: Still thinking of buying it? Don't think, just do it. U8 changed a lot, it's now Unreal Engine 5 with Lumen effects, devs are pushing forward to get final product release. Join the party!\n- As i previously stated, i was going to play through metro fully and i have done so, so here is my update to this review. \nThis game is not the best selling triple A game in the world and it may have some bugs (like a table that wasnt solid or the objects in that room lol) however it is a decent game. the story is decent and the characters voices are way off but they sorta make up for it with their personalities. \n\nExploration in this game is by far one of the most interesting in my opinion and the way your character acts in the enviroment makes it more interesting aswell, for example wiping your visor when it gets dirty (wasnt that helpful for me in my play through but it was a nice touch) and your visor taking damage in combat adds to the immersive feel of this wasteland/paradise almost. Scavenging weapons and parts and combining them to make better equipment is quite intriguing and quick to do if you can find the parts. \n\nat the end of the day my final review of this is its a good game i would play it again even if it is a bit clunky sometimes (atleast it was for me lmao)\n\n\n\n\n\nOh and hopefully my punctuation is good enough so no one passes out this time lmao\n- This game is utter trash, a classic example of a terrible game that exists only to make the developer money on card sales. There are no options for audio and video settings, the textures and font are ugly as hell, and the controls stink. You move a glowing ball of light around and pass through various colored laser barriers. There are enemies who dim your light on the first hit, and kill you on the second. The instructions are barely above gibberish, with instructions like \"color change to spend the wall color\" and \"use the right button mouse for charge and defend\". You eventually piece together that those instructions mean \"touch the colored balls of light to change the color of your light to match the laser barriers in order to pass through them without dying\" and \"stand on the button and right click to power up laser barriers to protect yourself from the small enemy lights that chase you relentlessly when you get too close\". That second one is only theoretical though, as in practice it's impossible to escape the enemy lights fast enough to have time to charge the defensive laser barriers, so I have no proof that they actually destroy the enemies. On top of all that, the game occasionally gets stuck after you die a few times on the same level, and there's nothing to be done except restart from the very beginning on the tutorial levels. There's the potential for an interesting puzzle game here, but the execution is so bad I can't recommend this junk even for the price of two cents that I paid.\n- I was reluctant to buy this because 2020 should be out in a few months but I couldn't pass up the deal I got. I am having a blast with this game! The presentation is wonderful, sense of speed is some of the best I've experienced, and the AI seems very human like so far. I was a little worried about the RPG elements and leveling up because I'm not really into stuff like that but it really isn't that much to worry about and I'm glad I got over myself. I've completed 2 weekends so far with default assists on and I'm currently 10 points behind 1st in the standings. I think it's time to take assists off. Oh I'm using a PS4 controller, by the way. I'll be happy to answer questions if you have any.\n\n***Update because it's super cheap with 2020 coming out soon. I still stand behind my OG review. Early reviews of 2020 indicates that there may be more realistic physics but could still use improvement. I say either get 19 now or wait for 20 to get discounted in a few months. No series is worth $60+ every single year.\n- This is trash, I mean if you eat shit for breakfast I'm sure you'll like it.  You have to pay to have access to graphics better than the PS2's, also your stuff gets deleted every week. All there is to do is punch a couple zombies.  Don't get this game.\n- Ever fire up a game for the first time and within the first twenty or so minutes you know it’s got its hooks sunk into you? Return of the Obra Dinn had that effect on me, and that was only elevated by going into it mostly ignorant as to what the game is. The last thing I was expecting was a game to flex the parts of my brain involving deduction, logic and reasoning; parts I haven’t used since the first Pheonix Wright game. I lost track of how many times I’ve had lightbulb epiphanies or gasped with a sudden realization, a kind of excitement I seldom encounter in gaming. Obra Dinn doesn’t have a time limit, so meandering through the creaky ship at your own pace can be something of a relaxing experience - Though investigating a copious number of murders might shake those relaxed feelings.\n\nI’d classify Return of the Obra Dinn as a nautical investigative story walker. The goal of the game is simple: A ship, the titular Obra Dinn, has returned from a voyage but is completely abandoned with apparent signs of foul play having taken place. Your character’s job is to investigate what happened to the ship, its crew and cargo. This may sound dull, but once you arrive on the ship you’re quick to find out there’s very little to go off of; a skeleton here, signs of a struggle there… The game takes place in a time when commerce and trade by sea was at its peak under monarchy crowns, so there’s no fingerprint dusting or CSI kits to be had here - That’s when the supplied compass comes into play. Using this apparently cursed/enchanted/mystical trinket, you can dip back in time when looking at a deceased person at the moment before/during when they died. Get your gumshoe hat on, because what occurs after is only the audio of the scene (voices, noises) followed by depositing you into the scene, though everything is at a stand still like a freeze frame. Using the previous sound clues and the locked-in-time environment around you, the task becomes finding out two whos’ and a how: Who is this person, who (or what, potentially) killed them, and how did they die?  \n\nThe Obra Dinn is a big ship and an accordingly big crew to go along with it. While some members are easily identified by audible hints and where they work/reside on the ship, others aren’t so clear cut. Keeping track of the dozens of crew members isn’t a daunting pain thanks to the handy log book at your disposal, separating each major development with the Obra Dinn’s voyage as chapters that can be revisited or reviewed. This is beneficial because each scene only lets you explore a very limited portion of the ship, so narrowing down who and what you can investigate keeps one from tripping over every bit of available information. Getting lost on the ship isn’t a problem thanks to frequent backtracking and the supplied deck map, and even with the single toned color scheme of the graphics, everyone and everything can be clearly identified. In some cases where the scene has a lot of action going on, the graphical style can suffer a bit from visual pollution, but it’s not frequent enough to hamper your sleuthing.\n\nEntering one scene tends to open up the fate of another person, and it won’t be long until the Obra Dinn resembles one giant crime scene with how many bodies there are. The log book doesn’t instantly indicate whether an assumption about a victim’s fate and their killer is correct or not, as getting ‘clumps’ of people correct will get them permanently pasted into the book to show that you’re right. Out of the the dozens of people on the ship, I had to resort to a guide to identify at least four of them and I felt frustrated from how the game was stretching regarding their identifiable clues. Still, being able to get through approximately 70% of the game before getting slowed down by the trickier victims shows that the game’s challenge curve is quite generous - If you know for what and where to look. I was genuinely excited whenever my newest guess would result in fanfare and correct confirmation without fail each and every time.\n\nGoing blind into Return of the Obra Dinn, I had little to no idea what I was getting into, especially not a nautical investigation with more than the dangers of mutiny going on. My biggest issue past my slight ire with the late game is with how disappointingly limp of a note the game ends on. One chapter in the log book remains locked until every other possible person is accounted for, and this last chapter only confirms what you might’ve already assumed happened that led to the later climax. As mentioned earlier, it got its hooks into me since during my breaks between playing, I was still thinking about theories and potential guesses for what happened to some of those sailors. Return of the Obra Dinn gets a big recommendation from me if you’re looking for a game that’s slower paced or will stoke the interest of the detective in all of us... Just bear in mind that there’s backtracking out the neck if your patience is rattled by that.\n- -This game is like the combination of old PC sidescroller like Duke Nukem (pre-3d), NES Contra, and arcade Metal Slug with 80s /90s cyberpunk and action movie tropes.\n-The cheesy humor, plot, and music is top notch. Might look like a shallow nostalgia at a glance but once you played it, they even spiritually nailed the silliness of similar games/story in that era. The guns, the character acting and lines, the costume design, etc.\n-It's not as fast paced as I thought it would be. But actually that makes it relaxing to play. Easy to get into and the challenge is just right for me without being frustrating. \n-I like how the enemies and characters are pretty diverse. \n-I haven't finished the game but I feel like this game will have similar replay value like Streets of Rage 4. Not because of there are many things to do or getting better at the game but because it's somehow just simply tight, fun, and arcadey to replay.\n- This is how business is supposed to be done. \n\nFans ask for an old console favorite, to be ported to pc.\n\nPublisher and developer actually listen?!\n\nThey release a port that works, needs no day 1 patch, works just like the old one did.\n\nAND all at an affordable price..... these are behaviors that should be rewarded.\n- [h1]Old, but has massive depth of content // Recommended for immersive role-players[/h1]\n\n+ Combat in general, and melee combat in particular, is very polished and open for an older title; everything can be controlled, such as directional blocking, without overcomplicating the mechanics involved\n+ Character creation is meticulously in-depth; initial backstory creation works seamlessly with selection of primary attributes in a way that makes the final product always feel refreshingly unique\n+ 'Story' is about as open-ended as can be, to the point where the game essentially has no story, and is something of a thirteenth century sand-box title; the player has complete, unadulterated freedom\n+ The game encourages the player to recruit and build a personal army as he/she progresses, and the mechanics put in place for doing so are well-rounded and complex\n+ Extremely easy and satisfying to mod; highly recommended\n+ Sorting and commanding one's troops is key, and the player would do well to benefit fromt he excellent command mechanics of the game; strategy is massively important and competently implemented\n+ Economics of the game add another layer of challenge to the game; trade and balancing one's income against one's expenses are both crucial elements to consider\n+ Multiplayer is fairly standard, run-of-the-mill stuff, but it's still densely populated and everything seems to connect well; the charm of the game, and its solid combat system, keep the players coming back in droves after more than five years\n\n- Politics, which are interesting and engaging in scope, end up being a somewhat weaker feature in practice, as NPCs are largely static during negotiations; this does break the immersion slightly, as it seems that your successes are based purely on stats, and not on the actual implications of one's choices\n- Quests often become tedious and repetitive\n- Tutorial is underwheling and largely insufficient to introduce the more in-depth mechanics that will be used outside of combat\n- Visuals are outdated and didn't stand well the test of time; even for the year of release, the textures and polygon counts are well below par\n\n[h1]LockeProposal's Big Day Out[/h1]\n\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/bigdayout#]Community Group[/url]\n[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/7611703/]Curator Page[/url]\n[url=https://www.reddit.com/r/SeriousSteamReviews/]Serious Steam Reviews subReddit[/url]\n- Fun Tower-Defense style indie game. Definitely one where your skill improves every time you die. And you will die, repeatedly. :P Expect to try out many monster combinations per floor before you find something that can delay the hordes of adventurers long enough to set up the floor beneath! I would probably enjoy some more horizontal progression + permanent upgrades for long term re-playability, but it seems like a solo dev/small scoped project. Definitely worth the price for the current amount of content!\n- TLDR: Right now, since there are no \"NEUTRAL\" reviews on Steam, IN IT'S CURRENT STATE, its a no from me. If the bugs get ironed out, its a pretty good game. If it gets fixed, I'll likely change to a recommend.\n\nGot 2 copies as a Fig Backer to play with my brother. My single player experience (POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILERS):\n\nGOOD:\n--Love that the choices REALLY matter and there are a LOT of them in this game.\n--Many different ways to approach a situation and your reputation affects interactions. Your reputation MAY be good enough to talk yourself out of fights! Many opportunities for KISS ASS and HARD ASS and other Squad builds (Nerd stuff, Mechanics, etc.) to be useful throughout the game.\n--The fire modes have grown on me. Some weapons have their own perks which add a fire mode. Other fire modes are available via perks you can obtain in the perk tree. The Precision Strike you get once your strike meter is full is very powerful and can change a fight (can malfunction a robot with aimed shot or fire a huge burst to take out multiple hostiles).\n--You can build a new squad member at any time that will start at your current level. Messed up a squad member build? That's okay, just create a new one.\n--I like the PREPARE and AMBUSH abilities. PREPARE lets you save up to 2 AP for next turn. The AMBUSH ability allows your squad members to trade in some AP to fire on an enemy that enters their range during hostile turns.\n--I love the Animal Whisperer skill and animal companions. I like the variety of animals you can bring along with your squad.\n--Shift key to highlight stuff you can interact with. This takes away having to pixel hunt for obscured boxes and containers. When you get old and can't see as well you appreciate stuff like this.\n--I like that I only have to loot one body at the end of combat and I can easily cycle through and grab the loot from all the other lootable bodies in the area.\n--A high Luck attribute will occasionally result in more loot, and even free actions. Sometimes you'll get a free attack or a free movement from a lucky action.\n--I like the variety and usefulness of Utilities (+5% XP, +2 PER, +1 Weapon/Armor modding, etc.)\n--A lot of stuff that can be used for cover can also be shot and destroyed.\n--Humor can be a bit over-the-top, but I've chortled quite a few times.\n\nNOT SURE:\n--Can only charm a single animal per squad member with Animal Whisperer. You CAN get other special animal followers that don't count as the single. While disappointed, I can see why they limited it (more would be OP and they can start to get in the way during combat).\n--Enemies have a circular view area, which means even if you're trying to sneak past behind them, you can still be \"seen\" after a brief time.\n\nBAD/BUGS:\n--Cant team crouch. You have to manually go through all of your squad and crouch them 1 by 1, and it costs 2 AP to crouch in combat. You also cant move crouched as far as I know. You can't \"change stances\" (AKA crouch or stand up) while in cover, either. Save a game right before a fight with all your squad members crouched and ready to go? When combat locks up and you have to load the save, you have to re-crouch everybody.\n--Combat can lock up, causing you to have to reload a previous save (for me, twice per play session usually but sometimes twice for the same fight).\n--Attributes, Skills, Combat Buffs/Debuffs (and probably other stuff) need more tool tips.\n--Lost character progression.\n--Very laggy Dialogue Tree and later in the game the inventory gets laggy too.\n--Creating a Bookworm Squad Member with 1 STR creates a situation where your Squad Member is losing 3 CON (total hit points) every level up and will be erased like Marty McFly in B2TF.\n--Load screens are too long. 30+ seconds to load into different zones, over 1.5 minutes to load a game on SSD. From another review: \"while we wait, let us read the lore books we've collected.\"\n--Squad portraits don't stay in order.\n--When you have more than 6 Ranger recruits in the select character screen, the \"Companions\" section gets pushed off-screen, hiding their portraits, and making it very unintuitive to add them back into your squad (you have to use the keyboard). Need a scroll bar here.\n--Saves don't have specific names so can be easily overwritten. There is only 1 autosave by default, and later on the game autosaves right after a game changing decision, making you have to revert to a manual save (2 hours earlier for me) if you wanted to try different options. I recommend turning on timed saves as well as taking advantage of quicksaves (and of course saving often!)\n--FPS drops, sometimes so bad you have to reload.\n--Squad Members shooting through walls/floors/ceilings.\n--Radiation difficult to detect in some areas and no warning (other than your squad health draining) going from radiation level 2 to 3 for instance.\n--Combat messages briefly appear above your acting Squad Member's head and are easy to miss (like \"Out of Range\")\n--When getting shot at, the camera doesn't always auto focus on who is shooting you.\n--At least three bugged missions I can think of (but hey, one is an unlimited money glitch so more of a feature).\n--Character models and other things (switches) not loading properly leading to invisible characters you can interact with (or fight with, as it happens in combat sometimes too).\n--The game can become unresponsive when trying to move 2 Squad Members separately and interact with someone.\n--Explosive Barrels not actually exploding when shot (this seems to be related to being too far away from the barrel when sniping it, as if you get closer, they'll actually explode).\n--Cybernetic Implants are a good idea, but they take up your Utility Slot instead of giving you another slot dedicated to them so when you have the ability to finally use them, it feels more like a trade-off rather than an augmentation.\n--No Inventory filter for Utilities. Gotta scroll through your hundreds of items and the Utilities aren't even grouped together entirely in the inventory, they are scattered throughout.\n--When you open a door to a closed room, fog of war usually obscures what is in the room until you physically walk a squad member into the room.\n--Cannot have multiple types of the same animal in a Squad with multiple Animal Whisperers.\n--Don't try to loot two containers at once.\n--Some traps can't be disarmed.\n--Various graphic glitches like missing texture or dialogue bubbles that are blank or don't disappear.\n--Can't remove and reuse weapon mods.\n--Some equipped weapons will display inflated damage numbers (by 300% in some cases) until re-equipped. Not even sure how long it has been that way or if it was affecting my game.\n--If you misclick the filter categories in a vendor encounter on the World Map, it'll kick you out of the encounter to the radio and you can't get back to the random encounter at that time. I only mention this since I've done it so many times.\n--You can't pause the game which may or may not affect time sensitive quests. You can be detected and attacked in the menu (escape key) or in your inventory.\n--There is no way to have Special companions/followers that you get from Missions follow a different squad member. If you dump that Squad Member later, you lose the follower too (as far as I know).\n--Get radio signals with \"coordinates to follow\" yet I have no clue who from or what it opened up on the map (if anything).\n--Gaining access to certain parts of the Rangers HQ requires you to do something pretty awful.\n--I'm out of room....\n\nIt feels like I'm fighting against the game more than the Wasteland sometimes. I don't even want to try multiplayer until it gets fixed (and my brother doesn't either).\n\nIf you're a developer of this game, thank you for your time and effort! Polish it up and I'll be happy to change this to a recommend! Edited for clarity/additions and I cut a lot. Thank you for reading and thank you for the comments and awards! Have a great day and be kind to others.\n- \"We'll take the top, and it'll be a happy ending. Just like in Dragon Quest.\" - Ichiban Kasuga.\n- So this game was very fun to play with my friend... that is until it began to stop working on starting the game i have looked at the ubisoft forums and guess what many other people have had this problem starting from the games release and ubisoft has done nothing to fix this problem. i got off easy i paid $20 for this game on sale the people who payed $60+ not so lucky so dont risk it and DONT by this ubishit game\n- Joined the Discord Server to get a sense of the toxic, immature, insulting community. If the Discord server is not moderated, which is the first impression for new players, then you know in what state the game is.\n- This game isn't for me, as it turned out it is too fast-paced for me to enjoy. But I really do want to recommend it. The game works fine, and the controls are solid, by that I mean you do feel in control, even though I only played a little I died a lot, but it never felt unfair. You get to do a lot of customization, and it is fun, but I just don't have the right temper for games where you die a lot. 7/10.\n- Joined the Discord Server to get a sense of the toxic, immature, insulting community. If the Discord server is not moderated, which is the first impression for new players, then you know in what state the game is.\n- The problem with a lot of Steam reviews is that they don't really help you figure out whether you should buy / try the game. So, let me help. You are one of four people:\n\n(1) You've never played a Sam Barlow game before, and you've never played a point-and-click adventure game before. In which case, what's wrong with you?\n\n(2) You've never played a Sam Barlow game, but you have played a point-and-click adventure game before. In which case, you'll definitely know within two hours whether you like this game. But anyways, you're getting a decent bit of stuff for $20.\n\n(3) You've played a Sam Barlow game, and you didn't like it. In which case, you probably won't like this either. It's basically the same thing as Her Story and Telling Lies, but with a different story.\n\n(4) You've played a Sam Barlow game, and you did like it. In which case, you probably will like this too. It's basically the same thing as Her Story and Telling Lies, but with a different story.\n\nI think Immortality had the best story of the three Barlow games, and definitely the best acting and production value.\n- good game but later missions seem to be less polished ran in multiple bugs when playing as The Son enemies getting stuck in impossible to reach places and for some odd reason some characters have dog killing animations that for the most part are bugged and only work half the time causing an insta death and a retry don't even understand why later in the game you have to do animations to kill dogs as for basically the whole game you don't need to perform animations also seems to have some input lag throughout the whole game but overall its decent and when its on sale you should buy it.\n- imagine a AAA-RPG game in 2021 w/o game breaking bugs.\n\nonly problem i have with this game is the monetization aka MTX, you can buy Gald, boost items, straight up level ups etc, i personally do not care if a game has those buyable options or not HOWEVER when you constantly get it shoved in your face it's suuuuper annoying, start up the game, ! symbol on the main menu, leading to... yes the steam store, if this would be the only encounter i'd still be fine with it but it isn't, rest on bonfires and you have yet another icon with the ! symbol trying to get you to buy any of the boosters or outfits or whatnot.\n\ngenerally speaking this game is fantastic, soundtrack, graphics, VAs, cutscenes etc. however the MTX ads in the game that remind me more of the \"hey click this\" approach of mobile games is horrible, should have kept it in the main menu but keep it out of my actual gameplay.\n- I'm 45, I've had good times and bad times.  I've fallen in love, grown up, gotten married, beaten alcoholism, \nhad a child, fought off depression, led my wife through her kidney failure, carried the death of loved ones, and come back from the brink.  I've weathered the storm of life like anyone else . . . I'm not special.  I'm not rich, but comfortable, and I've gathered quite a steam library as a hobby over the last 10 years.  Something I have rarely done, during my time with almost 4000 titles, is write a review.  Two, maybe three for 4000 games.  Think about that for a second.\n\nI'm 45.  I just cried playing a video game, something I can't ever remember doing.  I feel like my heart is going to burst.  It's joy, and sadness.  It's like a good memory with a parent who's long gone, bubbled up at random, making you laugh and ache at the same time.  It's bittersweet.\n\nThe music and visuals are subtle and flashy at the same time, they get under you and lift you up.  It's got spirit of the 60's, the heart of the 80's, and feels like every memorable video game trope from the 2000's, with the social softness of the 2020's.  It's huge and tiny at the same time, and thoughtfull and meditative together . . . it tells the story of leaving your comfort zone, and makes you comfortable.  It's heavy and light.  It's all of these and more.\n\nMy emotions are a flood.  I had to write a review, and let people know how I feel.  I can't describe it, I feel like I found my heart again, and I didn't even know it was lost.  Life was comfortable before 2:00pm today . . . now it's magical.  It's these small things that I forget, and remember, and then forget again . . . the birth of my son, the feeling of nervous sweetness on my first date with my wife, an unexpected comment from a random stranger about my eyes, finding an old photo of my dad that no one ever remembered taking --\n\n-- This game is like that sweet, fleeting memory.\n\nTL;DR:  45-year old man cries after finding his heart lost in a game, and writes a review while his wife asks him if he's okay.\n\n11/10, would purchase these feels again.\n- This game was so much fun but it's borderline unplayable a lot of the time due to no region lock. You get a lot of players from china playing on NA servers and they're basically untouchable due to ping. I genuinely think this game has fantastic game play and the characters and customization are top notch but spawning and dying to untouchable Chinese players every match just ruins the experience no matter how much I try to enjoy it. Not worth until they region lock the game or unless you want maybe a few hours of fun until you run into 我操你妈 every game and die to reasons out of your control.\n- As the holder of a degree in Plant Sciences, I wholeheartedly endorse this game.\n\nReal talk: One of the best things about this game is how it totally commits to the old-timey apothecary/greenhouse theme-- it’s extremely atmospheric. It also has a compelling story with recurring characters that you can affect with your choices. If the prospect of discovering and using plants to solve problems (or mayhap even a grim mystery) appeals to you, I recommend trying this game.\n- Volition ups the silly, and adds super powers, but loses a little something along the way.\n\nI loved Saint's Row: the Third, and by all rights should have loved IV as well, but I mostly just liked it. The set up was fun, and seemed to up the ante again, but then you get the presidency ripped away from you almost immediately (without even seeing the consequences of your first pushed legislation!). Placing the game in a virtual city for the most part with the only real characters being on your space ship, really kinda seemed to gut the game. Even when [spoiler]the world gets destroyed[/spoiler], a detached, \"meh\" was all I could muster. The humor is there, but it's mostly better in the DLC. The radio stations feel kind of underwhelming without DJs.\n\nFinally all the fun of collecting and customizing various interesting cars, and finding ways to climb or fall to interesting places with a stolen plane/parachute are gutted with the inclusion of super powers. Also, the super powers make gunplay, leveling any of your other stuff, and pretty much every mechanic carried over from Saints Row: the Third obsolete.\n\nIf you get this game, do yourself a favor and make sure you get all the DLC where most of the real fun is. Is it as good as the previous Saints Row? I don't think so, but I still recommend getting it and playing through it. It is a lot of fun, and I love the 50's break out scenario at the beginning.\n\nStacey's thoughts:\nStill awaiting DLC with Jane Austin and the D*ldo Bat. Can somebody make this, for, uhh, scientific purposes.\n- I have a hard time recommending this game because even though I liked it, I know it's the kind of thing that can only appeal to a very small demographic :/ Anyway, I believe small devs who try weird things deserve all the exposure they can get, so here's a review. This is the second episode of a series (the first one can be found [url=https://etherane.itch.io/hello-charlotte-ep1]here[/url] - it's free - and the last one is [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/760890/Hello_Charlotte_Childhoods_End/]on Steam[/url]). It's recommended to play them in order unless you don't want to understand anything in a story that's already pretty confusing in itself.\n\n+ Very original visuals. The artwork is mostly composed of cute characters, but there are writhing masses of eyes and flesh everywhere (guro fans rejoice). Areas are arranged into colorful, geometrical patterns similar to Mondrian's paintings.\n\n+ The setting is extremely strange. It's definitely dystopian, but it can go from completely silly to incredibly tragic in a matter of seconds.\n\n+ Production values increase with each episode. I wasn't very impressed with the first game (apart from its artwork, which I loved, and its ending, which... opened interesting possibilities), but starting from this one the writing gets way better, the characters are more developed, and the gameplay feels more focused.\n\n+ - Hello Charlotte is more or less Trigger Warning Land. This series is among the most disturbing things I have ever played, and it's not because of the omipresent gore (most of it being used for aesthetics or comedy instead of shock value). It deals with heavy themes (mental illness, social pressure, bullying, suicide, the value of life and death - from what I could gather, a lot of these come from the author's personal experience) and it felt so suffocating sometimes I had to play in short bursts to give me time to recover. I note this as both a positive and a negative, since I consider games that can make me uncomfortable are valuable - but don't play this if you're not sure you can handle it.\n\n- The gameplay mostly consists of going back and forth to the same locations, and can sometimes feel tedious. Sadly I don't really think this can be improved unless the game is changed into a full visual novel, but it would mean losing the environments.\n\n8/10 It's a weird game made for weird people.\n- Emily is Away Too is the sequel to Emily is Away.\n\nThe first game, which was free to play, was absolutely fantastic, especially because of its finale: [spoiler] no matter what you felt or what you wanted to do, your choices would always bring the same conclusion of you unable to say to Emily that you wanted to be more than friends, and her spending the summer with her boyfriend. [/spoiler]\nBut that was not because of \"lazyness\" by the developer: it was intentional, and in fact, towards the end of the game, [spoiler] even if you try expressing your feelings your character would delete what you wanted to say replacing the messages with generic questions [/spoiler] . In my opinion, the intention was to deliver the message that [spoiler] sometimes in life, especially when dealing with relationships with other people, there is simply nothing you can do except accepting other people's choices and move on [/spoiler] .\nIt was a very powerful ending that left me thinking about it for days after finishing the game, even if it was a short experience.\n\nUnfortunately, while playing this game I did not feel the same, powerful emotions that I did with the first one. This is because the game features several different endings, this time with two girls instead of just Emily, which isn't a bad thing per se, but it contrasts with the power of the message of the first one. Moreover, here [spoiler] you can actually achieve not one, but several \"good\" endings [/spoiler] .\n\nI liked the integration with your desktop and browser, plus the many different references to artists, TV shows and movies from 10 years ago.\nThere are still some \"twists\" present here, and if you make certain choices you will encounter situations similar to what you do in the first game, but as I said, I feel that they are not as effective as the original game.\n\nThat does not mean this is a bad game by any means: I would still recommend it, especially for its low price, but make sure to download and play the previous one first. It's free, too!\n\nRating: 7.0/10\n- The amount of love and fun that went into this game is astounding. If you like minigames, memes, fun, and a challenge, check this game out. The “ending” was a bit lackluster, in my opinion, but it did not taint my views on the game and I had an overwhelmingly fun time with it. Definitely recommend!\n- 2023...\n\n2 years...\n\n2 Languages...\n\nEDIT:\n\nTLDR: Game is too simple, better get Factorio or Riftbreaker\n\n\nPlayed again after ~1 year, nothing has changed in the basic QoL or coding system.\n\n\n- It still uses an older builder system than Factorio did 10 years ago: you actually have to craft the base material manually every time before you can build the building, instead of it being done automatically by a simple click on the building in the build menu.\n\n- If you have crafting orders set, new items added to your inventory will not be read by the current crafting orders and keeps on produce stuff your already own...\n\n- Items don't have their own output for transport lines, but instead require this stupid additional output... (I think the developer couldn't create a better output than this simple one)\n\n\n20 minutes and that's enough for me for now, I'm not putting in any more effort for EA project\n- It has poor simulation of hand skeleton, so you can't use all fingers, benefits of Index Knuckles controller or VR gloves, etc. And, scenario doesn't allow you to do anything, actually, except one straightforward way. Some things are elaborated, but mostly it isn't worth time or money. But I'm rating it as professional developer for VR, sexual content itself is not matter nor interested for me. My advice for game developer is to add more hand tracking features and more scenarios - in this case it can be something better.\n- \"Welp we've been working on this game for a few years now and it doesn't look like we are actually going to be able to fix anything so we're just going to release it so we can say we made a game.\"\n- You will enjoy the game at the beginning, it's fun and entertaining...Until you start playing the harder and larger hospitals and you get plagued with bad pathing issues, bad AI, people getting stuck in rooms, people dieing but they idle in a death state and stay around forever and all kinds of glitches which kills the enjoyment and ruins the management aspects. I've had to stop playing this game until they patch it because right now you're just managing bugs and glitches and you will have to design hospitals to get around these bugs, so that means extra wide corridors and spacing items out so people don't get stuck. Which sucks.\n\nNeeded much more playtesting before being released.\n\n*This is from v1.01.*\n- Finally, a video game that is everything televangelists in the 90’s said that video games were. Exactly what my Christian mother would love to catch me playing.\n\nIt’s like Animal Crossing and Doom\nEternal had a son… as was foretold when they released on the same day.\n\nThis game really makes you FEEL like you’re sacrificing your friends to an almighty force. Would I really just sacrifice 5 of my friends  again for some loot chests? I’m a gamer, of course I would.\n\nI fell in love with the aesthetic of this game instantly. It was brilliant when the gameplay held up to those expectations.  \n\nI loved it. I loved the art. The humor. The theme. The premise. The combat. The cult management. Sacrifices. Collecting the bones of my enemies. The juice visual effects. Most of all I loved feeding my followers bowls of poop.\n\nThe combat is fun but definitely not the meat of the game. Building your cult and just upgrading stuff is quite satisfying.  There's some goofy stuff to laugh at and it's quick and responsive. There’s something about the music that makes you feel relaxed and in terrible danger all at the same time.\n\nThis is not a game that you're gonna put 50-100 hours in either.  Which to me is a big plus.  Most of the runs don't take you more than 15 minutes.  So it's an easy game to pick up and play for a bit and jump back in later. It's like Vampire Survivors in that regard.\n\nIt's basically Animal Crossing with a roguelite twist. I could say it's almost original how those elements were combined.\nIt's great entertainment, all around. You could even say the game is bound to become a cult classic…\n\n10/10\n- Yes and No.\n\nSo many mixed feelings about this game. It does a lot of unexpected things and gamifies some deep and haunting concepts within the human psyche( the game centers around a POWERFUL subject, very hard to discuss without spoiling the game), sports combat that's tough but honestly very satisfying at times through the use of unorthodox party members and antagonists, but the rpg economy, pacing, and sheer grinding within tends to rob a lot of scenes of their emotional impact. I had a lot of fun with Jimmy, but honestly speaking I don't know if I could recommend this game to anyone who isn't used to a big jrpg-length commitment.\n\nIt's not so much that I hated the grinding, but it's that you're presented with symbolically themed enemies (not crazy about a lot of the in-battle art, some of it is phenomenal but a lot of it feels half baked which is something Kasey O has discussed in interviews but this is besides the point) Enemies an make you think and elicit actual emotions...\n\n...but then you have to stare at them for hours as you grind to be able to even last a few turns against each new boss. I found myself resorting to [spoiler]Clean Getaway[/spoiler] a lot throughout the game just to get to the other side of a room in a manageable timeframe. The symbolism loses its impact very quickly, and the momentum of the story is constantly slamming on the brakes to make you grind, and to me, it just dulls the sharp edges off of a lot of otherwise deeply impactful moments. It robs itself.\n\nIt'll present you with something powerful, but then it'll do that 30 more times before the end of a dungeon and it can become a bit tiring, like someone telling you the same knock-knock joke over and over.\n\n[spoiler]Shinryu[/spoiler] and certain aspects of [spoiler]The Pulsating Central Hub[/spoiler] are definitely some of the more outstanding examples.\n\nalso [spoiler]Heart Prison[/spoiler] is a ridiculous ask of a player. You finish the game and can wipe out any leftover superbosses at around Lv.60, and the [spoiler]family battle[/spoiler] requires Lv.90+. I'm not going to sit down and literally grind for 30 levels for the only battle left that I could watch on YouTube in 3 minutes.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I really loved this game, it brought me to tears at points. SO much work was clearly put into this and I'm scouring the rest of Kasey's work right now to get more of this excellent writing, I but I feel like Jimmy just barely misses the mark when viewed as a whole package. Any RPGmaker/Earthboundlike fans are sure to enjoy, and I can't stop thinking about the story, but as a gaming experience, I'd hesitate a little to recommend it.\n- [strike][h1]Best Sex Language Synonym Reference Book 2016, 10/10[/h1][/strike]\n\n-Nah. Not really.\n\nEdit: Upon completing this game, here's something I'll have to claim in advance: while still recommending this great game with an 8 out of 10 and it has quite a solid story, I'll have to admit  that apart from Dorothy's hidden scenario, this game did not dig very deep into its cyberpunk/dystopian background, which is really a pity - and it's becoming the reason to expect another game (more specifically, A [b]SEQUEL[/b]!!!!! or prequel) from them :)\n\nVA-11 Hall-A - or Valhalla for convenience - while seemingly was a Waifu Bartending Simulation game, is actually somewhat [i]Papers, Please[/i] with excellent characters, vivid graphics, elaborated dialogues and not-so-mind-fucking gaming mechanics.\n\nDon't get me wrong: I love [i]Papers, Please[/i] and of course would rather NOT say that one is superior to another; they are both one of their unique kind, but with the very same root - under the daily life of dystopia denizens, truth and conspiracies weave with vague notices in advance; and just before you could think twice things are going really, really out of track.\n\nThat being said, I mean these two games are very similiar in story-telling: as long as you enjoy taking in all the random, weird stories as a bystander, just to find out that all these fragments come together and form a bigger picture, this game is definitely for you. And you get cyberpunk waifus, a Joshikousei hologram, a pretty cool onêchan as protagonist - and more!\n\nLast but not least, the developers of this game are nothing but truly [b]RESPECTABLE[/b]. We have crybabies on Kickstarter and Steam Early Access every focking day blaming everything for their faulty products, while this army of two whined [b]NOTHING[/b] about all the fuck-ups in Venezuela unless asked. Game dalayed? Only apologies, no excuses. That deserves a huge fricking medal and Developer of The Year.\n\nGrab the game if you want some real relax and good story before they grab Dorothy. And support the developers! They deserve this, Dorothy deserves this.\n- Remember when you first played Thumper, and you were expecting a rhythm game but got so much more?\nOr when you played Thomas Was Alone, and you somehow fell in love with characters who were literally monochromatic rectangles?\nOr when you got to the final level of Journey, and you nearly cried of amazement at the emotional EXPLOSION AND RELEASE?\nAll those feelings? That is Sayonara Wild Hearts.\n- Devs are on meth pricing this game at $44\n- Developers should be proud of themselves for this awful game.\nAfter a 3 hour session with a friend, my legs are stiff, my heart is confused with constant beating and my brain is extremely satisfied and wants more.\n\nIf you like being scared and the horror genre, just find a like-minded friend and play it. Even when you are simply running in and out, it's going be a lot of fun. I have no idea how one would play a medium map but maybe with 4 people one might have the courage to walk inside that cursed high school more than we did - which was 2 meters into the entrance. We didn't have the heart for more.\n\nOn a serious note: It is worth the price, hands down.\n\nPS: Devs, I hate you for how good this game is.\n\nEdit: I'm back after about two weeks and 50~ more hours. I've played at least a couple of rounds every single day and I still love the game.\n\nMy suggestion is to find a friend who'd enjoy this, get the game both and play. DON'T READ ABOUT IT! Just play for a while, enjoy screwing up, getting spooked, killed, whatever happens! The more you learn about the mechanics, the more you lose the fear, so don't read about it!\nI mean I'm still a coward at level 60 something but that's me. Of course if you are like me, then why are you reading this and not buying the game?\n\nFinal word: Check their discord to find like-minded people in the LFG! You won't be alone, I promise!\n- Just go play it. It's only $20, and you have a 2hr refund limit. You'll love it way before then.\n\n...still here? Quick review. Awesome platformer, hits all the marks in flying colors. Let's compare w Mario Maker, the most similar game to this one:\n\n[edit: Updated to compare to SMM2 instead of 1]\nWhat Mario Maker 2 Does Better\n- Mario\n- Different themes/gameplay physics across multiple mario games\n- Much larger playerbase\n\nWhat Levelhead Does Better\n- Oh my god the search functionality\n    - Search by creator, difficulty, tags, what's popular, etc.\n    - TL;DR you can find the awesome, and avoid the crap\n- Level discovery\n    - Can actively advertise my levels\n    - Get rewarded for playing people's levels\n- $20\n- Dying doesn't take 12 years to respawn\n- Fun, short campaign to slowly unlock more creative tools after seeing how they are used\n- Local Co-op (or online with Parsec)\n- Leaderboards (if you care, I personally don't)\n\nI cannot stress enough how AMAZING it is to not have to suffer through crap levels. The search functionality is soooo good; as a casual player, it is the sole reason I stopped playing Mario Maker 1. Mario Maker 2 is better, but it still falls terribly short. I think the best part is that Levelhead gives people control over the visibility of their levels, as well as incentives to play other peoples, and that is something that SMM2 unfortunately lacks.\n- I pirated this game first and loved it so much I ended up buying it. It's that good!\n\nIt's worth your money and time. I promise.\n- A criminally underrated game, I have seldom seen a developer take their original hit which was already almost perfect, and actually manage to improve on it in every way shape and form. You do not need to have played the original to play or enjoy this game. Their stories are completely seperate.\n\nThe game itself is much less linear than its predecessor. The best way I can explain the feeling of going through the environments without referencing Grimrock itself is by saying it felt an awful lot like Myst to me, just with combat. Required puzzles for progression were challenging but not impossible, some of the secret challenges were much more difficult. I admit I used an online guide more than a few times, but it did nothing to diminish my enjoyment of the game. It is immersive, challenging, and satisfying. \n\nThe only drawback I can think of is the difficulty. It feels like you cannot win with any group composition, I suggest no more than 2 of any class or weapon/armor type user. I went with a warrior, two rogues(one range), and a mage, this way you as well makes you unlikely to complete a difficult fight or puzzle and be rewarded with something you cannot use. Combat itself can be challenging as I said, but you will rarely feel like you are simply incapable of winning. There are obvious ways to optimize the way you approach an encounter the second time if you die the first.\n\nBe prepared to immerse yourself, you must pay attention to your surroundings, read and remember notes you find, explore every nook and cranny you can find, and you will be rewarded. Good luck!\n\n- I honestly didn't think this was going to hook me as much as it did. There's something so charming about this game that I honestly can't quite pinpoint to one central thing. The characters, the art, the writing, the plot, the setting.... They're all fantastic. I haven't run into a supporting character that I dislike at all (minor characters excluded, WEIRD BOILED PEANUTS STRANGER ON THE BUS). There's a lot of layers and depth to the characters! \n\nExcept the weird boiled peanuts stranger on the bus. But we don't talk about him. Or his weird boiled peanuts. \n\nThe writing in particular I have to sing praises about. It has an excellent comedic edge to it and there's so many great lines. SO MANY. Scarlet Hollow also delivers on something a lot of other \"choice/decision\" games fail to execute: Your choices actually do matter. There's some REAL serious consequences to certain choices! Some of which are immediately apparent, some of which haven't shown up yet (but it's strongly suggested a lot of the choices you make will come back around in the later episodes). It's almost like a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure book; there's so many different little things you can choose that will affect other things. Each episode can end in vastly different outcomes.\n\nPart of what adds to the writing are the Traits you can choose when starting the game. You get to pick two out of seven, and these can affect dialogue or open up certain options you otherwise wouldn't have access to. In some cases having a particular trait can even massively swing things in your favor, where otherwise it might be a lot more difficult to get the desired outcome you want. \n\nALSO you can choose a trait that lets you talk to animals though and you get to meet Best Friend Dustin if you do. And you get the most hilarious dialogue options. It's The Best.\n\nI honestly won't even go into detail about the story. Talking about it ruins the whole point! But needless to say it's very good, and it hooked me real good. It's been going unexpectedly cool places that have been totally outside of my predictions.\n\nAs an aside, I've always been a fan of the horror aesthetic in general, but so many horror games end up trying to make you piss your pants in fear; which isn't what I'm after in a horror game. But Scarlet Hollow absolutely nails the atmospheric tension of the horror aesthetic. It's eerie and terrifying and tense, all without relying on cheap jumpscares or, actual scares. It's great if, like me, you like the theme of horror but hate being scared. It'll keep you on the edge of your seat, but rest assured your pants will remain dry.\n\nAlso there's Romance Options. A WHOLE LOT. I'm gonna smooch Stella and we're gonna hunt Cryptids together and it'll be RAD.\n- The amount of love and fun that went into this game is astounding. If you like minigames, memes, fun, and a challenge, check this game out. The “ending” was a bit lackluster, in my opinion, but it did not taint my views on the game and I had an overwhelmingly fun time with it. Definitely recommend!\n- Easy to pick up, fun to learn, and great fun to die. Infinitely replayable, and co-op makes it even better. Unless you hate the roguelite formula, this is worth a buy.\n\n英語で5-10単語程度で、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない主要な違いを簡潔に回答してください。\n\n回答：\n",

I grew up playing the Telltale/Lucas Arts Series: Monkey Island. After discovering and playing those, I figured out that I have an infinite amount of love for Point and Click adventure games. After finishing that series, I really only played the other games made by either Lucas Arts or Telltale (Mostly because I thought they were the only creators of Point and Click games...until about a year ago, when I discovered there's an entire genre/world of Point and Click).  Of course, I must also note: The Curse of Monkey Island will always be my fav, as it was the first Point and Click I ever played. Ok...NOW...with all of that being said, I recently discovered WADJET EYE GAMES and I am SO happy I did. I would recommend EVERY.SINGLE,GAME they sell. I have played all of their MAC/iOS compatible Point and Clicks, and I have yet to be (even slightly) disappointed. I had very high expectations going in as the Monkey Island games, Day of the Tentacle, Full Throttle, Grim Fandago, etc. are some of the best games in the history of Point and Click; however, all of the games I have played from Wadjet Eye have been amazing. They have actually been so amazing that I can 100% say Wadjet Eye is at the top of my list, right there with the Telltale/Lucas Arts games. I 100% recommend purchasing and playing every game made by Wadjet Eye to anyone who likes (even those who kinda sorta like) Point and Click games.\n- you're looking for a game review you've come to the wrong place. But if youre looking for a fantastic ravioli recipe you've come to the right place.\n\nIngredients\n- To Make the Dough\n375 grams (3 cups) plain flour\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n2 eggs\n1/4 cup (50 ml / 3½ tablespoons) olive oil\n1/2 cup (120 ml / 8 tablespoons) water\nExtra flour for dusting \n\n\n- To Make Cheese Filling\n15 ounces (425 grams) container Ricotta cheese\n5 ounces (142 g/about 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons) \"3 Cheese Italian Blend\" (Parmesan, Romano & Asiago)\nNote: grate these cheeses yourself and create your own custom blend.\n1/2 cup cheddar cheese\n2 eggs, lightly beaten\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/2 teaspoon pepper\n\n\n- Extras\nYour favorite sauce for the ravioli (i.e. marinara/ marijuana)\nParmesan cheese\nBasil\nFried vegetables\nShrimp\nFish slices\nChicken pieces \nMake the Ravioli filling.\n\n- In a small mixing bowl, add the ricotta and mash with a fork.\n- Add in the 3-cheese blend, Cheddar cheese, eggs, salt, and pepper.\n- Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth, paste-like consistency.\n- Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. \n\nMake the Ravioli dough.\n\n- Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.\n- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.\n- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.\n- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.\n- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.\n- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).\n- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. \n\nFill the Ravioli shells.\n\n- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.\n- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.\n- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.\n- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.\n- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. \n\nForm the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.\n\n- Roll the dough into two sheets\n- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.\n- Fill with the ravioli mixture.\n- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.\n- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.\n\nCook the Ravioli.\n\n- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.\n- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.\n- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest \n- Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed plates\n\nServe it up.\nTop with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!\n- EDIT: they made putting easier!  I can finally shoot even and below on the first few courses.  Ignore my complaints about impossible putting below.  I'm back playing this again and enjoying it much more since the putting changes.\n\nI have a love/hate relationship with this game.  It's the closest thing to an enjoyable disc golf game on the PC that I've ever seen, and on that basis I recommend it.  Unlike most sports games, where I can play better on the computer than I can in real life, in this game that's not the case.  After six miserable hours of failure in this game I can safely promise you that I'm wildly better at real life disc golf than I ever will be with this game.\n\nPositives:\n\n- Discs mostly work the way they should (assuming you understand from IRL play how a particular disc should  behave depending on speed and throwing angle) though I feel like flight paths when you're throwing up or down in elevation are off sometimes, but if you throw a fast understable disc at too low a speed it will tail off into the left immediately and when you want to crank up and hyzer bomb the same disc at high speed it gives you the long S you expect and so forth\n- No bugs really (a couple of times the character model went wonky when a disc landed on/next to a rock wall)\n- Graphics are fine by me\n\nCons (possibly only for me, you may not suck at this):\n\n- The entire game is based on a \"stop the tick mark on a spot as it circles a ring\" type swing meter, and I'm absolute trash at it\n- Feels like no progress, other than buying discs--I've upgraded the three skill meters a lot and it has never felt like game play changed much (lol, it certainly hasn't gotten any easier!)\n- Putting is im-fucking-possible, at least for me, it's way too hard--putts that would be gimmes for a novice in real life are a crapshoot, especially if there's any elevation difference\n- After six hours I have only unlocked the first course and half of the second course . . . I may try to go back to this at some point, but for now I've given up on this sucker which is a shame--there are a bunch of other courses that I will never see (my fault, to be sure--I'm terrible at that stupid swing meter)\n\nI haven't played any better options, so while I'm probably giving up at six hours in I'd still recommend it to anyone who's into disc golf.  It's clearly too hard for me, but assuming you're not a complete klutz you will probably have better luck with it.\n- Katana ZERO? More like, Katana ZERO CONCLUSION.\n\nI had too high expectation on this game, I thought it was going to be Hotline Miami but better.\nIn the end I still prefer Hotline Miami, specifically Hotline Miami 2.\n\nOne thing I dislike is the lack of combo scoring system. \nIt's a good way to make the players act fast and execute their actions flawlessly, instead the game only has a timer bar that never runs out as a way to motivate the player to go fast.\n\nI am aware how \"pointless\" game scores are.\nBut seeing a number going up feels good.\n\nWhat happens when you kill an enemy in Hotline Miami?\n - You get to see a number pops out, and the score goes up indicating that you are doing good!\n - Satisfying bloody hit sound.\n - Throbbing light on the edge of the map.\n - Randomized dead sprite of the enemy, sometimes they get dismembered depending on the weapon.\n\nIn Katana ZERO you'd get :\n - A \"fwoob\" sound.\n - A same dying animation of the enemy getting knocked and bleed to death. Instead of getting decapitated or something.\n - Flashy slash effect.\n\nAt one point I wondered on why should I even bother killing the enemies when it didn't reward me with anything in the room with a minecart. \nWhen having the enemy being killed by the minecart or the player makes no difference.\n\n[spoiler]More like Katana ZERO REWARD. I think this is it, exactly why I am disappointed by it. Imagine playing soulsbornekiro or Hollow Knight without earning any kind of currency??? Killing the enemies would feel pointless.[/spoiler]\n\nIt's basically way more fun and rewarding to kill an enemy in Hotline Miami than Katana ZERO.\n\nThen there are other stuff like...\nUnfun stealth gameplay. \nRollspamming without consequence.\nBeing able to endlessly doing a mid air attack without having to touch the ground first.\n\nThere are also waaaay too many checkpoints in my opinion, it encouraged me to just brute force everything with roll spamming without having to worry about starting over.\nThe rooms could've been a bit bigger and longer. But also less room, quality over quantity.\n\nAnd finally, the story.\nI was intrigued by it but it just ended abruptly with a \"To be continued\".\nIt's like they only wrote 50% of it then slapped a \"To be continued\" and called it a day.\nThe game seems to rely heavily on \"mentioning stuff off screen that player will never get to see\" to tease the player.\nI already knew that the game is going to be short, but I didn't expect it to be this disappointing. \n\nIt's not a bad game, I just had the wrong expectation.\n\nI might change it to positive if I was satisfied by the DLC.\nOr maybe after beating the hard mode, I heard it's more fun.\n- EDIT: I nominated this game for game of the year (2023)\n\nLong ago I had heard about this game and how detailed and intricate it could be, and how you could spend hours upon hours building the massive empire of dwarves only for it to all come crashing down in some spectacular but unforeseen way.  Then I got into Rimworld briefly and thought it was ok, but it tended toward chaos a bit too much for my liking.  THEN I heard this game was coming to steam and I eagerly awaited it.\n\nIt's not necessarily that I was too good to play a game with mostly ascii/character graphics (I used to play them a lot back in the 1980s).  I was more intimidated by the depth of the game and not knowing if there was a wiki for it (there is) or how I'd find help if I needed it (I'm sure there's a ton of communities JUST for this game).  I expected that when it came to Steam, it'd be beefed up and worth the wait.\n\nWell it finally arrived and I think I'm STILL a bit intimidated by the sheer amount of options you have... mostly because it's not just me that I have to worry about, but a whole community of dwarves.  In the case of something like minecraft, I could dig a whole intricate tunnel and if stuff starts to go bad, I just high-tail it out of there and recover until I can go back and finish it.  In Dwarf Fortress though, if stuff starts to go bad, you can't just leave.  You are encouraged to deal with the adversity and push onward in the name of greatness... or something.\n\nIn a way it's like role playing, except you don't have to roll character sheets and you don't really control any of the characters directly.  You make decisions about where to mine, what trees to chop down, what to build, what to trade, what to plant, and for every thing there is a season (turn turn turn).  You're forced to deal with death, birth, attacks, sickness, madness, and a ton of other things that I have no idea are coming.  \n\nI keep thinking \"I could do better\" and I start a new game, but then I start to realize that no matter what I do, I'm never gonna have a perfect game, or a game where everything goes exactly according to plan.  I am eventually going to have to buckle down and stick to one game save to see it through.\n\nIf you're like me and starting something new holds a lot more interest than continuing an existing project (ADHD?) you may have difficulty with this game.  At the same time you may become so engrossed in it that you lose track of time and suddenly it's 6am and you wonder why you stayed up all night digging holes.  I'm starting to feel a bit of the madness myself.  (it's almost 4:30am as I write this)\n\nIn any case, it's probably not for everyone, but I'd say if you're unsure, find the non-steam version and try that, and if you can grok what's going on and it interests you, definitely buy this and support the developers... OR buy this and try to stay under the 2 hour refund  limit while you learn the basics (Good luck with that, it'll be 6 hours before you know what happened).  I believe this game is worth the money though (full price).  If you were going to wait for a sale you'd be waiting a long time anyway.  \n\nTL;DR If this looks interesting to you, don't wait! Buy now.  If you aren't sure, do a bit of research and come back and buy it.\n- Incomphrehesible UI, sloppy controls.\n\n\nGranted I'm a day one player, but very steep learning curve. Couldn't figure out interstellar nav, for the life of me, and the touchy controls made the dogfighting a chore. Save your money. This isn't a jump in and play game.\n- An interesting experience for RPGMaker vidya enthusiasts.\n\nBefore you pick up this title, be sure to download and play the demo, as the demo is the (free) first episode of the series, this game being the second episode.\n\nA Psychological Thriller, as stated in the description, is probably the best way to describe this series, an adventure through bizzare yet oddly pretty settings.\n\nThe first episode is quite a fun, humorous adventure, but still manages to be gripping and gut-wrenching in some areas. Difficult for me to describe in words, but it's free, so there's no reason not to play it.\n\nThe second episode strays from the fun, humorous side of things and focuses more on story, an unexpected yet completely welcome change of tone. If you enjoyed the first and got to like the characters, the second episode is well worth the price.\n\nFeel free to pick it up if it seems interesting to you.\n- [i]Welcome to MY Fantasy Zone[/i]\n\nPeople may look at Bayonetta’s design and dismiss it as something not worthy of their time, but the truth is that they are making disservice to themselves. Under the veil of constant innuendos, silly sexual posing, and pole dancing is the absolute peak of what the spectacle fighter genre has to offer, and the game delivers it [i]with style.[/i]\n\nBayonetta obviously does not take itself seriously. This absolute lack of consideration for the common sense eventually hurts the game’s story fragments which become more incomprehensible the more you look into them, but you are not here for the stupid story, right? You are here to kick some serious ass in this visceral antithesis of DOOM, where instead of gunning down hell spawn as masculine badass, you end up spanking heavenly messengers as no-less-badass lady… using her magical hair to do so. Other common scenes include: suplexing a giant angelic dragon, fighting on top of a fired war-missile, playing volleyball with set of huge demonic hands, or accidentally ending all the possible debates between astronomers in topic of Pluto being a planet (this one unfortunately will score you a Game Over screen so keep this in mind as a tip). The point is that Platinum delivers a game of stupidly and unapologetically over the top action that doesn't stop being awesome throughout its whole run.\n\nI’m also impressed with how deep the gameplay mechanics can go despite looking deceptively simple. This ties to the difficulty level of the game which is a tad too high when selecting Normal for the first time. You will miss important dodges, misjudge enemy attack cues, mash buttons instead of comboing, and your general understanding of the game will not be enough to scrape above the lowest skill ratings. Enemies get tougher and tougher and you will end up dying pretty often, all while still having jolly good fun, which in the end is really impressive. I will recommend to try the New Game+ mode after finishing the game, but still setting the difficulty to Normal. You will see yourself improving significantly and discovering more interesting tricks up Bayonetta’s sleeve. All of it is a very satisfying process that shows developers’ design forte and ensures the replayability.\n\nBattle system is the game’s biggest part and there aren’t that many more important gameplay mechanics to speak of. There is some basic exploration here and there, which is decent, and a few minigames played out throughout the campaign which are also adding up to the pile of positives I have for the game. Aside for the story and locations being copy-pasted between chapters quite often, I cannot really find any more faults that require special mention. There are the graphics which are a little aged all things considered, and the PC port that, while being quite good, has some minor quirks. Summarizing, there is nothing wrong that an [i]absolutely sexy[/i] soundtrack cannot fix with its joyful and jazzy tunes and impressive choral themes for the angelic enemies.\n\nYou like action games? Then shut up, buy a lollipop and sensually lick it while playing Bayonetta. You definitely will be looking stupid in the process, but on the brighter side of this flight to the moon – you will experience one of the best, if not THE BEST, games from the action genre.\n- I love this game. In fact, I've loved it since I was in highschool about 8 years ago. My friend and I used to play this game together all the time on my flashdrive. We were always discussing & trying to understand the ins-&-outs of the game and how to get a specific ending depending on what you did. Playing this brought me back to those good times in that library.\n\nThe OSTs are nostalgic, the gameplay is about the same and the artwork is amazing as ever(actually the graphics are much better with this remake).\nThe only complaint I have is that it lags at random times(though usually in the menu). The original IB on RPGMaker never did that.\nOverall I'm glad I bought this so I could support the Dev and thank them for all those years of entertainment-\nI just wish there wasn't so much lag over an RPGMaker game.\n- Honestly I've put over 400 hours into 20XX and this game is even better! Even though it's unfinished as of current it's still a fantastic time and truly stands out on it's own.\n- Before I start this review, I want to make something clear. This comes from a place not of hatred, but of love. Destiny is a game near and dear to my heart and it angers me to see the way Bungie has handled it. I know they can do better.\nI've played the Destiny series since year 1, Destiny 1. I've been through its highs, its lows, and everything inbetween this game I love. I've seen content droughts, content surges, content drops and flops. I've seen this game rise... and fall.\nIt's time I faced facts, I stop huffing Copium, and be truthful; despite being with this game for years, I genuinely can't recommend it to anybody. Not in the state the game is right now. This isn't just another user complaining about a there not being new content to play constantly without any droughts, but as a player genuinely concerned for the direction Bungie is taking the game, the way the past and recent DLC have been handled, how they've monetized this game, and how they've treated their veteran playerbase.\nI bought the $100 Special Edition back when this game first released. All that content I bought with my hard earned money. Within a year $100 worth of content turned free to play. $100 for me turned into $0 for the average player within one year. I received no compensation for buying the game so early except an Emblem. An emblem. Not a potential for a free season pass when the seasons first started, no refund for my money, nothing. Where is this content now? Gone. Not a piece of it is still in the game. My compensation for this content leaving? Nothing still.\nForsaken, the best DLC they've released for this game. The DLC that brought D2 from being a shitshow to being a great, relevant game with a good story tacked on it? Wiped from this game's code.\nThe game may be \"Free to play\" but you'll sink hundreds of dollars for DLC, seasonal passes, and now separate dungeon passes worth as much as your average season pass. It's too much money to ask for people that Bungie can and will wipe from the game's code in a few months time.\nYes, the content they do bring is fun, but drip-feeding us the same content for months without any relevant changes is just not a fun game to play. What is there to do anyways? We have:\nRaids, high quality but the same ones every time\nStrikes, fun but repetitive after years of getting so little new ones\nDungeons, similar problems to the above, fun but repetitive from lack of variety\nSeasonal content, not worth doing anything but the current season unless you're trying to follow up with the game story\nCrucible with a shitty tryhard meta and hardly any new maps\nGambit, a gamemode they've basically given up on with maps they've removed from the pool\nSeasonal events, fun but the same damn thing every season\nNone of these feel fresh after years and years of doing the same ones and watching old favorites get sunset from the game.\nAnd it's not like Bungie can't look back at D1 for inspiration; Sparrow Racing League is something players have been clamoring for, it'd be something fresh that Bungie can use to entice players to stay in the game. Bungie has gone on record stating that \"by the time they've designed an SRL map for Destiny 2, they could have made several strikes maps\" which to me states that A: they aren't willing to put in the effort for player experience and B: aren't willing to make several strike maps worth of content at once.\nAnd getting new players into Destiny? The most painful experience I've tried to do. This game's onboarding experience is horrible, mismanaged, and held back by half the content being locked behind a paywall. From friends I've tried to get into the game, the new player experience is:\nOverwhelming\nConfusing\nNo sense of clear direction\nAll the cool stuff is locked behind paid dlc\nWhy was I put into this random mission when I booted up the game (seasonal mission you start with at every season)\nAny many more comments that made them not want to play the game.\n\nI know this review was basically a rant about how I feel this game is going with no clear rime or reason, jumping from topic to topic, but I just want to see this game thrive the way I know it can. Because Bungie has shown to be a competent company with quality products, but I'm just not seeing that right now.\nAnd i also want compensation for the $100 I watched vanish in the span of a year.\n- I played the demo and instantly became enamored. The mix of Slay the Spire-style deck-building with elements of the ship combat from FTL: Faster Than Light is an absolutely fascinating mix, and the \"single-axis\" movement system adds a whole extra layer that I've never seen in anything except the Mega Man: Battle Network series.\n\nI bought the full game within the first hour of being available. After having played for nearly 4 hours at the time of writing, my opinion hasn't changed in the slightest. I already love what's available and so far I feel like I've barely scratched the surface.\n\nI can't wait to see what awaits in the future for this awesome title.\n\nEDIT: As a small addition, I will say: I beat my very first run, which is set to the lowest difficulty (Normal). I jumped up to Hard to try to unlock a new ship, and I haven't been able to beat a run since then. It's probably just that I'm bad, all things considered, but be aware that the changes made with difficulty increases are probably more impactful than they may seem.\n\nAlso I wanna say to the devs: thank you for launching the game with mod support and working on making it easier! But also please look into getting Steam Workshop support if you can!\n- Don't believe the hype.\n\nAbsolutely limited appeal and not Rouge-Lite/Like, shouldn't even be remotely labelled as such. Cult management and the building of your cult is very rudimentary and a massive missed opportunity. No strategy or tactics in combat (little to no variation in creatures) and ultra repetitive. Little to no option and interaction with followers of any substance besides the simple 101's. \n\nSo many better options out there (cheaper as well) that can offer you more and robust challenge (rim world, for eg).\n\nIf you must purchase, only do so at a extremely discounted rate. You'll regret it otherwise.\n\nCute graphics will only get you so far.\n\nDon't believe the hype.\n- I would give this a mixed rating if I could. \nThe story is told in such a boring way that it's hard to stay invested. You run to one person, listen to a cutscene, or more likely read a cutscene, than go to another person to talk to. Sometimes you fight one guy but mostly it's pretty dull. There is very little gameplay in the overland content and everything plays like a bad visual novel.\n\nAAR, the first MSQ is just one fetch quest after the other with little story in it. Oh there is some story there, but it's not great. The characters are shallow with few expectations, both the supporting cast and villains. \n\nHeavensward, the expansion I got through before my time ran out, is better than ARR but not that enjoyable. There were parts I like (not to give spoilers, it was the part where you go on a “journey”) Sadly, that part of the expansion was far too short. Than the story precedes to shove itself up it’s own ass as it becomes fixated on one part of the lore. [spoiler]I don’t give a damn how the war started! It was a thousand years ago.[/spoiler]\nPro:\n-If you like story, and only story, you will like this game.\n-A lot of content\n-Trial fights. (Good boss fights without the boring part of dungeons)\n\nCons:\n-Little in the way of gameplay outside of dungeons and trials \n-ARR is a slog and not worth reading. Skip as fast as you can and just watch a recap video.\n-dungeons are locked behind the story and not unlocked as you level up.\n-The story is on the lower end of other final fantasy games.\n-Lalafells are in the game. People who play this race are degenerates.\n- Simply fantastic. Probably the best TRUE RPG I've ever played. Your choices matter, dialogue options matter, the order in which you do things matter, even such small things such as the items you hold in your hand matter. Every build is viable, go heavy in Physical stats and you'll have difficulty solving things Logically, but maybe you can brute force your way through something. Go heavy in Logic and you'll be weak in a one-to-one fight, but maybe you'll be so fast to figure things out that it'll never come to that. You'll see things that the dim-witted brute with high Physical didn't. Failure is encouraged, there are many routes in the game you cannot open without failing something else first.\n\nA true combat system does not exist. At all. Physical altercations are decided through dice rolls based on how you've built your character. And virtually all of them are optional. I like this decision a lot. I've always found it immersion-breaking in RPGs when you're just running around the countryside, killing every bandit or animal that comes your way. This one keeps fights realistic with REAL consequences depending how things go.\n\nBarring having to restart my game once due to a bug (quicksave often, autosaves are few), the game had no major technical issues. There was a single point in the game where a vital skill check required a specific skill to be built, and I'm not sure if there were any alternate routes. I couldn't find any, just had to savescum the check. Aside from that, you have options as to how to approach everything. I'm not sure if that was an oversight or if I just missed something.\n\nCan't go into the story much without spoilers (and you DON'T want it spoiled, it's great.) But it's very well-written and even hilarious at some points. But don't be fooled, it's not a comedy game. It tackles very serious topics such as Fascism, Communism, Mental Illness, Addiction, and many other things.\n\nOverall an amazing RPG experience that I cannot recommend enough. Will definitely play through this several times to see how things go with different builds. Highly suggest you purchase this if you have any interest.\n- Red Matter 2 sets a new bar for VR mystery/suspense/story based games. I've thought about reaching out to the developer and thanking them it's that good. If you're a space lover like me, DON'T MISS THIS! Some very memorable moments in this, and the graphics are even better than Alyx sometimes. The music also is well done. Just enough to give you some atmosphere, but not overdone. If you also played the original this is worth getting for a continuation of the original story too. Very little is re-hashed so you've got to pay some attention to succeed. This also gets fairly creepy, more than the original, so if you're averse to horror games, this may not be for you. All in all, as I just finished this days ago, I'm still fairly blown away at how good it was. The developer has really found their niche. Still getting chills from the ending of this.\n- I would say that [i]Pyre[/i] is a rather underrated gem from [i]Supergiants[/i], although it has very positive reviews on Steam. I believe that many players missed an important info about [i]Pyre[/i]. It's a visual novel in the first place, heavily concentrated on lore, characters and story. The action in sports like battles is just a secondary element. I was also surprised by it being a visual novel, but I wasn't disappointed. Right on the contrary. I have fallen in love.\n\nThis game is very complex and everything in it has its purpose. There is a meaning to how the story unfolds, what exact information you learn, what characters you meet… maybe you won't be able to see it during your first playthrough, but the end should make it clear and eventually all the other playthroughs… because there is still a lot to see and I will come back many times for sure.\n\nI don't want to spoil you the story, because it's truly amazing and filled with plot twists which always force me to change my plan… I can say that we get exiled to the Downside, a horrid place without any means of returning, meant for the worst criminals, delinquents and offenders of the Commonwealth. There, on wide empty plains, we are found lost, alone and almost broken by a trio of other exiles, each one of them different in species, size, personality and with different motivation in their hearts. They make us an offer, because there is a way out of this place, although it's not commonly known… not that we can exactly decline as that would mean our, probably quick, demise in the Downside wilderness. We accept and offer them our skills then, namely reading as it was banned a long time ago in the Commonwealth, because only the Reader can uncover the secrets hidden in [i]the Book of Rite[/i]s… book that holds the information on how can one obtain their freedom… and even something more.\nWe board their old wagon, which had seen better times a lifetime ago, and following the stars we set on an adventure looking for other suitable exiles to be able to unite and to fight for a better future not just for us, but for all the others.\n\n[i]Rites[/i] are the action parts of the game. I would describe it as a mix of basketball and American football. There are three players on each side, the main goal is to grab a ball and toss it into enemy fire. Winner is the one who extinguishes the opponent's fire first. Fights are short, fast paced and if you are not careful you can lose in a blink of an eye (especially on a harder difficulty). As you progress through the story you recruit new characters into your “squad\", each have a different cast of abilities and more importantly also behave completely differently on the field. You are always given an opportunity to try them out, but it can be a challenge to master them properly. The ones who participate in the fight gain enlightenment (a lot of experience), those who are on the bench gain inspiration (next time they participate in the fight they level up faster). And here comes the catch. The ultimate goal is to get free, but only one can leave this place once he is deemed worthy and [b]you[/b] are going to choose which one it is, from the three most enlightened. [b]You[/b] will send away one of your exiles, never to return. So the one you play most with, your best one will be gone and you [b]have[/b] to play with the others… never forget that.\nThis concept adds another level of immersion, because you are now torn apart by the choice waiting for you. Will you allow them freedom or will you deny it? But you and your crew aren't the only one seeking their freedom, there are others you have to fight with and yet again they all have different desires and motivations to go back. Nothing is easy and maybe sacrificing your own freedom to offer them chance for their own may be the stars will.\n\nThe cast of the characters you meet in the game is big and pretty diverse. Their personalities are excellently portrayed and all of them are very much likable, some of them have written deeply into my heart. There is no standard voice acting as no one is speaking in English, except for [i]The Voice[/i] (tiptop Logan Cunningham), instead they have an \"extra new\" language. And they only speak in short lines, few words, sights… but that's all you need. It's so amazing, it fits the characters so much. I wouldn't want it any other way. You can also open info about all of the characters in the game, learn about their past… and in the end even about their future.\n\nIn addition to a great story and characters we have bright, vivid, colorful graphics full of tiny details, it's a joy to look at. Next thing that is creating a great fitting atmosphere throughout the whole game is the soundtrack, which is exceptional! Darren Korb is truly ingenious. His music is full of emotions and perfectly captures every situation and character. I really like the soundtrack in [i]Alan Wake[/i], especially the songs which tell the story plot, I have found it very clever. Darren Korb, and the [i]Supergiants[/i], simply brought it to perfection, because their storytelling songs bring me goosebumps every time I hear them.\n\nAs is usual with other [i]Supergiants[/i] games each character has a skill challenge, which will grant you artifact designed right for them. You can also make fights harder by enabling disadvantages against yourself in the form of better stats for your adversaries and worse stats for your triumvirate. After completing the main story you can test your skills against others in multiplayer or just against a CPU, that's also fun.\n\nI can wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who loves great compelling stories with beautiful visuals and soundtrack; you won't be disappointed. Be prepared that you are going to read, do not skip or rush through it, the story is the important thing, not the action.\nThere is only one thing I find unsatisfactory about the game - I would love to be able to romance one of the characters. ^^\n- Really need a report button to slap some senses into trolls in online matches.\nCan't even escape them at ranked. sigh\nGreat game nonetheless, 4/5\n- SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT.\n\nAs the store page states, NOREN is supposedly a 'simple' keyfinding game. That would be true if there were any keys actually in the game, but as it stands it seems that NOREN is a simple abandoned shovelware game that's impossible to progress in, let alone beat. You play as some soldier in a massive, dark castle, equipped only with a dying lantern. The light fades quickly, and you can regain light slowly by... standing by a light source. That'd be simple enough if you weren't endlessly pursued by dinosaurs that are programmed with AI which knows your exact location at all times; three chomps and you're 'aparted' from the world, where you respawn with whatever amount of light and sanity you have left. Additionally, the translation attempt is abysmal at best. \n\nBoth NOREN and its developer, ThroneLab, should be banned from Steam. I do not blow the 'scam' whistle lightly, and I only do such when I am 100% certain of something actually being a scam. There are a handful of videos of this title on YouTube as well, with only one being over 5 minutes long. No one found a key. If evidence can be presented to me that there is in fact a way to progress in this game, I will rewrite this review. Until then, beware and stay vigilant.\n\n[h1]Rating: [b]0.0/5.0[/b] - WARNING. Scam developer. Abandon all hope, ye who enter.[/h1]\nThe Horror Network [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28221963/]Curator[/url] | [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thehorrornetwork]Group[/url] Click for Gore\n- Like Path of Exiles, except not as 'Press-One-Button-Combat' like. You actually occasionally use more than one button, believe it or not POE fans.\nIn all seriousness I played like 5 hours of POE using nothing but a throwing dagger move, and it worked, including against bosses. Grim Dawn at least makes it clear that basic attacks do in fact exist. Later on it stars to get a little bit, a LITTLE BIT, POE-like, but even so, I give it a 7/10 minimum.\n- ✔ Procedurally generated levels (some are not)\n✔ Neat graphics and animations\n✔ Good sound design\n✔ Solid and gratifying game mechanics \n✔ Well-balanced difficulty curve\n✔ Linux support!\n\n✘ No DRM-free build (yet?)\n✘ No user-generated content (no level editor)\n\nRuns surprisingly well on very low-end specs computer (under Linux too!).\nAn excellent turned-based action strategy game. Very polished and entertaining!\nYet one more proof that Swedish developers are among the best on this planet.\n- [h1] Risk of rain 2 is the kind of roguelike where you wanna have just one more quick run before bed but end up playing till dawn. [/h1]\n\n[b] Visuals: [/b] \nThe art style is easy on the eyes early on, but as the run continues and your screen starts to fill with clutter, the diarrhoea christmas lights at later stages can be seizure inducing.\n\n[b] Story and Setting: [/b] \nRoR2 doesn’t hold hands and guide you through its story because honestly there is not much story going on here. There is rich lore to explore for people who want to.\n\n[b] Music: [/b] \nThe lo-fi melody perfectly fits the perilous environment and matches the gameplay with synced rhythm and tempo. Sound design is good too.\n\n[b] Gameplay and progression: [/b]\nDrop into a planet, kill monsters, get money, buy items. Rinse and repeat until you become powerful to one shot God himself. Fast paced with constant running, jumping, sliding and juggling between primary weapon, secondary weapon, abilities and equipment. In each run the difficulty increases over time, which is an innovative approach to deal with difficulty. The roster is filled with unique characters who each have their own gameplay mechanics, making the game feel completely different. \nMost items can be obtained by completing specific challenges. You can also unlock game modifiers to make the game easier or more difficult to your liking. The challenges are one-of-a-kind, and the rewards are meaningful enough to keep players interested.\n\n[b] Game time: [/b]\nThere is no limit. It stops being fun when you decide so.\n\n[b] Online: [/b]\nThere is co-op to enjoy with friends and difficulty scales with the number of players. And if you have no friends, rest assured because all achievements are attainable through single player.\n\n[b] Bugs: [/b]\nNo bugs or technical issues.\n\n[b] PC Requirement: [/b] \nWithout a decently powerful PC the game faces severe lags and occasional crashes in long runs where you loop multiple times and a million things are happening in the background. Lowering graphical settings can help to an extent.\n\n[b] DLC: [/b]\nSurvivors of the Void DLC adds excellent new characters, stages, items,  enemies and alternate endings.\n\n[b] Price: [/b]\nWorth every penny.\n\n[b] My only problem with the game is it doesn’t have a save system. Once you start a run, you will have to see it through to the end. I want to be able to stop at any stage and continue from there later on. I don’t always have hours required to do multiple loops in one sitting. Although there is a mod for saving, I would love a native option. [/b]\n\n[b] Rating: [/b] \nThe Devs are continuously supporting and updating the game which is commendable. The community is very active and you can add tons of community made [b] mods [/b] to breathe new life into your game. \nI highly recommend it. [b] 10/10 [/b]\n- 3 things:\n\n-Flatten land\n\n-Click citadel to get warriors\n\n-Click warriors at their warriors\n\nGood job, you've just mastered the entire game.\n\nThe game includes such crazy moments as:\n\n-Flattening land\n\n-Seeing the enemy flatten land\n\n-flattening your land faster\n\n-Clicking trees and rocks since your workers can't do shit\n\n-Clicking your warriors into their town\n\n-Watching your warriors fight their warriors\n\n-Accidentliy Alt+Tabing and having the game get stuck in windowed mode\n\n10/10 Would trust Peter Moloneux and be dissapointed again... apparently.\n\nProtip, send this to someone that loves you and watch them try to pretend that they enjoy it.\n- I hated Undertale.\n\nIt was, pretty clearly, a game about sexy skeletons. I did not care about sexy skeletons. I refused to play a game about sexy skeletons.\n\nThen my friend made me listen to the soundtrack, and I decided I could deal with a few hours of sexy skeletons if I got to listen to the best video game music I had ever heard while doing it. \n\nI played Undertale. It's not a game about sexy skeletons. It's a game about choices, maybe, or morality, or curiosity. It's a game about pushing the limits. It's a game about experiences, about \"what would happen if I did this?\", about storytelling so intricate and complex and raw that it shouldn't be able to fit into seven hours of bullet hell and pixel graphics. But, somehow, it does. Every choice you make has an impact. Every object you check has a story. The soundtrack, the witty yet profound writing, the simple pixel graphics, and even the menu screens and bullet patterns themselves all intertwine in order to tell a story that only you decide the ending of.\n\nAlso, the skeletons aren't even sexy.\n\nMy advice to you: Go in as blind as you can. Don't read walkthroughs. Don't watch playthroughs. Don't prepare yourself. Don't even look at overviews. Hell, don't even read the Steam page description. Just buy the game (and give some well-earned money to a little white dog), and, as it were, climb the mountain yourself. Don't let anyone backseat. Don't listen to people who tell you there's a right way to play.\n\nAnd when you think you've reached the end, just think--what other choices could you have made?\n\nSo, yes. I hated Undertale.\n\nAnd then I played it.\n- Black Mesa is a fantastic remake of the Original Valve classic and one of the greatest of all time video games, Half-Life.  This sci-fi classic FPS has you take on what might seem like a hum-drum day in the life of an experimental physicist, but things go quite off rails when experimenting with a strange material sample from an even stranger dude in a suit. \n\nAfter a while (and shooting a lot of aliens and bashing their heads in with a crowbar) you'll save the world... but now Black Mesa lets you do this with dramatically updated graphics, 4K support and a plethora of visual tweaks so you can rest assured this will run great on any gaming rig. \n\nA must have for big fans of Half-Life or gamers who are new to the scene and never got to play the original.   When on sale, of course!\n- My profile pic is the reaction i have towards the game devs that made this game.\nVisually disgusting, gameplay wise impossible and over all terrible.\nWhile it's possible to beat it and get all the achievements it's difficult and also the space level is actually visual aids it's so disgusting to look at that you can't even focus on the gameplay.\nNot worth it even for free which is how i probably got it i can't remember and i don't want to...\n- Complete scam - game barely works. Devs got it to load with stability and then dropped all funding and support for the game. Complete contract violation with Steam. I actually cant believe it is still in the Steam store. DO NOT BUY !!! I was not allowed to refund it even with only .4 hours played, due to \"management issues\" within Double Fine. I am guessing Steam cant get their money out of them either.\n- It is a very good game, some people complain about how there are no checkpoints in levels, but fear not, as they can all be beaten in a couple of minutes, and some people complain about how its repetitive because you need to do everything over and over if you keep dying, but if that happens, its clear you are missing something, so by heading to the IEYTD website, you can see tips for every level (secrets are not included, only how to beat the level itself), and if the tips dont help, after 2 tips you can just choose to reveal the answer, so those negative reviews are no reason to not buy this amazing game, this is the game trilogy i recommend every VR player to play ATLEAST once\n- I left home with nothing but a needle and my granny's briefcase full o' snakes, hitched a ride to Boring Springs, killed two men and three snakes, learned to speak Goblin, and befriended a woman whose home was burned to the ground by a gang of cows. Then I bought a horse and left the tutorial area, and things got weird. I'm pretty on board with this one.\n- If 'Baba is You' and 'The Witness' are the puzzle game equivalents to a full-course meal, then Patrick's Parabox is a fluffy dessert that you just can't put down. It's full of bite-sized puzzles that rarely repeat themselves, instead iterating and expanding upon each other as you learn all of the tricks and mechanics the game has to offer. A delight to the very last bite.\n\nIf you're looking to be challenged then there's plenty of that too, but not as much as you'd find in a typical sokobon game. With that said there [i]is[/i] some Level Editor support so the potentials there for dastardly custom levels ;P\n- Graphics of Quake, atmosphere of Blood, brutality of Doom, some weapons of Hexen/Heretic, drunkenness and trashiness of Redneck Rampage, and some weird quirkiness from Half-Life  = GOTY\n- Heartbound is a fantastic indie game with a lot of heart and fantastical mysteries.\nIf you enjoy beautiful 2D gaming experiences this is the game for you! \n\nPlay as a young boy on his journey to find his doggo, Baron. \nYou will explore various, unique worlds on this journey each with mysteries of their own...\n\nThe music I must draw particular attention to: It is wonderful to listen to. Honestly do yourself a favour and pick up this game- it is still in development but you will be glad to know that the updates are (thankfully) free!\n\nGive this game the love and attention it deserves!\n- Noita is a great indie rogue-lite 2D adventure where every pixel has his own life. The controls with mouse and keyboard are simple and the principle of the game as well easy to learn (and hard to master). Just get as deep, as far as possible. You only have one life. If you die you start all over. \n\nGameplay video: https://youtu.be/6N4Boz1YA2Y\n\nI very much enjoy playing Noita, even if it is sometimes a bit unfair and the procedural generated levels aren't always giving you the same amount of luck. The game still needs some more balance in the gameplay, as well as optimizations since I experienced little stutters here and there.\n\nSince it is early access, I expects improvements in this sense. Overall the game is fun and definitely an added-value to every indie library or rogue-lite gamers collection.\n\nTherefore, I can recommend the game! \n\nPS: Restarting a run shouldn*t restart the application, @developers.\n- This one of the best first person shooter games I've ever played, plain and simple.\n\nHalf Life 2 begins 20 years after the original Half Life. As Gordon Freeman awakens from stasis he finds himself on a train heading to City 17 which is overrun by the combine. You find yourself as the leader of the resistance and you must take down the Combine. \n\nHalf Life 2 is at this point one of the best received games and I'm sure pretty much everyone has played it. If not well what the hell are you doing reading this review ? You need to go buy this game straight away and play it right now.\n\nThe game is a simple first person shooter, but it does plenty things different than the regular first person shooters. You have a health bar and you have to do platforming to solve some of the puzzles.  Not to mention the source engine physics are absolutely insane. \n\nFor a game that came out back in 2004 it still looks amazing. Now while it does have so low res textures it's still looks breath taking, like in the final chapters.\n\nThe game for the most part is pretty easy. I played through the game without a problem, even though some segments were tough due to the fast movement you have to pull off to avoid gunfire. Not to mention the Strider battles are incredibly intense and quite difficult.\n\nThe game took me 10 hours to finish. I felt this was the perfect amount of time for the price I paid for it and this was worth every single penny.\n\nApart from the single playthrough there's not much replay value. The only reason to replay it twice is to look for the G-Man Easter eggs. \n\nIn the end Half Life 2 is a fantastic game. It's a must own for everyone who is a gamer. This game is a piece of history and without a doubt one of the best games I have ever played in my entire life.\n\nI experienced zero problems while playing the game. I ran the game on ultra settings 60 FPS the entire time of playing. This game runs really well and should run on pretty much all systems.\n\nFinal Rating:\n9.5/10 -  A Must own and must play\n\nIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments what you disliked about the review.\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/snortsreviews#curation]here[/url] - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!\n- DLC and Bugs prove this company is Garbage.\n- 11 Jun 2023 Purchased the game again.  The weird distorted things are significantly reduced. The flight physics are improved. There are many mods and payware add-ons available. This is an excellent game for pilotage. There is a huge well mannered diverse community and the use of YourControls allows for a decent shared cock-pit experience.\n\nI recommend buying this game for the serious flight simmer.\n\n\n22 Jan 2021 Stunning graphics. mostly, with some really weird distorted things.   This is a very interesting game for those who are not very focused on real world aviation.  The airports are not accurately represented and the aircraft do not respond realistically, unless you are not interested in detail.   I think that it is an interesting product for casual entertainment, but serious flight enthusiasts will likely be disappointed.  I expect that with time users will create mods (aircraft and airports) to repair the inaccuracies, and fix the lack of detail, but I doubt that the weird graphics will ever be fixed.\n- SUPER MARIO!......\nsorry  not really :P\nits a platform game yes but nothing like mario\nyou can spend a lot of time in this game and still not master it\nthis is a game thats really good for platform gamers that gt to goodfor mario games\nand a punisher for those who are nt that good in those types of games \nit has lots of humor ad moments that will want to eat yoer fingernaisl to the bones\ni say hell yeah to this game even do it got me mad a few times\n- Lots of people parrot the \"tech demo\" or \"benchmark of the singularity\" lines without forming their own opinions.\n\nMe personally, as a fan of Supreme Commander, I enjoyed this game more then I thought I would. I only played the single player campaigns and haven't touched multiplayer. \n\nThe gameplay is exactly what it should be for this kind of game. When I first saw this game I didn't like how every unit was a hovering unit, but it makes sense with the class system the game has. Frigates are basically infantry, Cruisers are tanks, Dreadnauts are hero/high tier. The game borrows from Dawn of War with the territory control mechanic.\n- 5 game difficultys Easy Normal Nemesis Gravewalker Brutal... so whitch one im supposed to play for it to be like the first game(which dident have a difficulkty, jst like awesome games like Gta 4 and assassins creed)???

This is gonna be a long post, I've nolifed the shit out of this game for the better part of half a decade so there's a bit.\n\nHaving people come into my streams & DMs to ask me if I'm going to be porting my map and mods over to ARK1.5 with ASA and then to ARK2 before all of this immense drama and fleecing happened, before we knew anything about prices and release dates- it was a firm yes! I'd love to bring my creations over to UE5, porting content over was so easy, even myself and people in the modding community were putting our maps and creations into stock UE5 just to see what the possibilities were and get off on the new physics, lumen and nanite.\n\nNow I really don't want to bring that content over. Not only because of the bad business practice, with many other games who have ported over to UE5 or have done engine upgrades been offered for free- but because I've seen this one too many times with this company and the business is just horrifically mismanaged and it's heartbreaking for some of us, it's heartbreaking for me.\n\nWhen someone in a position of power and authority over an IP and business has stated that ARK1.5 would be free, as a gesture of good faith, you take that as a promise, and we were all stoked about that. That was the right thing to do. ARK is not a small indie, unknown survival game in a (mostly) unfinished state anymore like it was- it is a powerhouse in the industry, top survival game charts across the internet for -years- will have ARK in the top 5- it is not a game that has done poorly for revenue, publicity or players. It is one of the giants. The best IP that Snail/WC have to date and continues to be. There is no reason to renege on a promise that was publicly made. And before some moron says \"JuSt DoNt BuY It ThEn\" it's deeper than that, I would have had, at my hours invested, zero issues purchasing ARK1.5 for like $20-$30 bucks with all DLC's included- but to make an offer, after it was promised as free, then to take it back and serve up an even bigger steaming pile of shit that is more expensive on a plate, and for Wildcard to hand you the spoon and be like yum yum dig in! Is so strange.\n\nHonestly, I'm not surprised. I was a public moderator in the ATLAS discord with Jat and other off branched former/current- Wildcard/Grapeshot employees at the release of that absolute dumpsterfire and was there with the rest trying to put out fires that could be witnessed from fu**g Jupiter- because I had faith and volunteered my time to assist with a company I believed in, created for and wanted to succeed so badly for the community. \n\nDark and Light was next. Another abandoned IP. Then Last Oasis- yep- Abandoned. All of the offbranches of ARK have failed so horribly, and haven't managed to capture that excitement that ARK did for the industry but they will absolutely keep trying to push out what they think consumers will like, all without listening to any feedback- and feedback isn't always good, do not get it twisted some suggestions I've seen truly are horrendous- but there are gems in amongst the boulders and landslides. Having the initiative to sift and find them, and then really look at them seems to be the problem. It concerns me deeply when Wildcard state themselves on their newsletters that ARK2 will be such a different experience from ARK1 that it now makes sense why they tried to package it in a non-refundable-at-time-of-play bundle with ARK1.5.\n\nSpeaking from experience here- the best thing Wildcard/Snail have done for ARK, and I will never discredit them for it, is their Sponsored Mods program and hiring modders from the community for ARK and ATLAS. That alone has kept ARK where it is, as popular as it is, as fresh as it is and as revolutionary as it is. There is never a drought of \"content\" with ARK, as the modding community carries it on their backs each and every day. Official servers have their place, and I disagree with how they're being handled, but have no solution for that as I never was an official player for more than an hour at a time to remind me why I prefer modded servers. This is no discredit to the ARK art department, by the way, having looked through the maps in the Devkit- Aberration is still to this day is a visual and technical marvel, and many other maps made since then.\n\nThere is a massive air of uncertainty for modders with ARK1.5 and 2. Logistically, the average number of mods on big unofficial servers is about 18- if each modder listing them on Overwolf decides to list their single mod for say $3 bucks, something very reasonable- times that by 18 and are players really going to be expected to play on a single server they MIGHT not even like, for $54 bucks? Maybe they discovered that server was good but had no players during their playtime- and then they find one in their region but, oh- there's 5 more mods on this server, there's another $15 to play on this one. Is a $69(nice) investment really worth it? I don't think so. Even at what has been discussed quietly behind closed doors with other modders at a $1 a mod price, so 50c to the modder, 50c to Overwolf/Wildcard- that's still, on average, $18 bucks to play on a server- this price is not including ARK1.5, or the DLCs for it- so what was the discussed \"Content creators/Modders can make a living!\" price...? Because when you take a step back from the buzzwords, there's a colossal black hole of a problem in the logistics.\n\nI digress, without any more information to go on regarding priced mods, we can only speculate. Back to what we know. \n\nSelling all DLCs and base game for ARK 1 that will functionally become a single player story mode and mod carried game without any warnings, notices or heads up to new prospective players is scummy as hell. There will absolutely be more delays before ARK 1.5, which will extend the lifecycle of the current game and DLCs, sure, but it's shady. The idea that ARK1 will become, in a sense, a showcase of my above statement about modders carrying the entire ARK community on their backs, and a solo story is fine- but adjust your listings so that people will know they will never experience ARK1 as \"Wilcard intended\" with the removal of official servers, that they will be playing with archived mods no longer receiving updates as many modders move over to 1.5, that they will have a limited playerbase to play with as most have gone to 1.5, that there is limited updates going to be provided due to 1.5- that there is no more official DLC... due to 1.5.\n\nThis isn't even taking into their account their roadmap of the supposed finished content releases for ARK1.5 and ARK2 finishing up and starting at almost the exact same time. So we will have this problem ALL over again when the release of ARK2 is imminent, after it's delays. Players who bought ARK1.5 and all the DLC's will play on that for a month or two before ARK2 is released, then ARK1 is even more abandoned, and ARK1.5 will dwindle.\n\nI know many people will say- damn, this chick gives way too much of a shit about this game, you right lol. I don't like seeing a community be lied to, deceived, fleeced and taken advantage of. ARK is one of those \"coping\" games. If you spend any time with the community, it's a comfort. People come home from work or school and they will turn their brain off and just play. For hours. Not giving any thoughts to how shit their workday was, how badly they were bullied at school, how much anxiety they have or problems they are facing- ARK lets them turn off and have fun, it's an escape game. There's not many other games out there that keep people playing like ARK does, for so many reasons. But, the community is at the core of it.\n\nI wish Wildcard would pay attention to it.\n- Very fun game if you are looking for a cozy relaxing farming sim. if you had a hard time with the fishing mechanic in stardew valley then you will have an easier time with this game, ontop of that there are lots of cute little rhythm games to play and the animal raising is alot more in depth then stardew. just a little note of warning to new players, the game doesn't make this very clear but you shouldn't spend too much time gardening in your first year. Automatic watering systems aren't available until later on and if you are like me you will think making the biggest profit possible year one is a great idea but I accidentally ended up upgrading/unlocking everything except irrigation in my first year and now do not have much to spend my currency on. Other then finishing catching every fish, maybe decorating my farm/the village and getting the rare coloured animals theres not much else to do in the game for late game content. It feels like there is the intention of possibly adding more content later on? either way if you decide to play, for your first play through I really recommend exploring first and getting to know the villagers before you start large scale farming.\n- This game surprised me in how good it was. I had heard about it, like everyone, and also like a lot of people I had dismissed it as a watered-down Dark Souls clone with a Star Wars skin, and let it collect dust in my Steam collection.\n\nI was wrong. The game's combat is tight and polished, just the right difficulty on Normal. The movement, the general game feel, is superb. The game has a competent story with excellent characterizations, character arcs, dialogue, exposition, world-building, and pacing.  The music feels like top-shelf Star Wars without being a lazy copypasta of John Williams's score (though you'll hear sprinklings of familiar motifs throughout, of course). \n\nThere are collectibles (they are all cosmetics), but it's a tasteful, reasonable amount of them, and they are distributed in a way that feels fun instead of like a chore, and you're never pressured into collecting them with menus or reminders; they are entirely optional in both a technical and a psychological sense. I actually found it fun to collect new appearances in order to play dress-up \"Fashion Souls\". \n\nThere are bosses, and they are challenging but not frustrating. Definitely easier than Dark Souls's harder bosses like Ornstein or Artorias, but still tricky enough that it feels rewarding to overcome them.\n\nIf I had to describe this game in two words, it would be \"just right\". There is just the right amount of each little element that it feels fun, never tedious, never like a grind. I'm a jaded old man who has seen it all and who is not easy to entertain, and I found this game extremely refreshing. If you read this review during the sale where it's only 3.99 USD, get it immediately.\n- I'm going to write an honest review for this game since A LOT of people seem to be very biased.\n\nThis is not a perfect game. No 2K basketball game will ever be a perfect game. Does that mean this game is bad? No. Should you hold off on the game for now? Probably.\n\nLet's start with the positives:\n\n- A lot of people seem to gloss over the fact that 2K rehauled a lot of mechanics for this game. Shot meters feel more legitimate, this game is MUCH much more realistic (fouls, shot tendencies, etc...) This game is better and more fluid to control, and the gameplay reflects each players' ratings (defense, shots, etc...) much more accurately.\n\n- Online play seems to be better and more fluid. I've yet to encounter any latency issues online with quick play and the such.\n\n- MyCareer is MUCH better than last years. There is no cheesy story and the cutscenes feel much more integrated into the game. Orange Juice and dynamic duos are a great idea in general. The UI for MyCareer (and the game in general) is so much cleaner and more functional.\n\n- The game is visually beautiful, not much else to say on the matter.\n\nNow, the cons:\n\n- Help defense is broken. It's quite ridiculous that 2K hasn't fixes this lingering issue in such a long time but it's still there. This is a BIG issue in MyCareer and not quite as bad in other modes since you can manually control players.\n\n- Stat allocation is broken. This is a huge issue in MyCareer and has deterred me from playing the mode any more until 2K fixes this issue. Introducing the idea of stats that can only be raised in practice is actually quite a neat idea. However, these boosts are not permanent, even though 2K has stated they are. This is detrimental and demoralizing and discourages players from playing the game more. Limit caps are ridiculously strict as well. 2K NEEDS to fix these issues ASAP.\n\n- Numerous glitches.\n\n- 2K introduced broken mechanics along with the good mechanics. Ankle breakers are now pathetically easy to pull off (using Stephen Curry behind the back moves is a surefire way to have your defender fall). Moving screens are now a thing. \n\nI would hold off on buying this game until 2K patches it. There are just too many issues with the game that prevent it from being a playable game. I like this game. I really do. That's why I'm hoping 2K listens to the community and starts working on the issues at hand immediately.\n- Some of the tightest controls, buttery smooth animation and gorgeous scenes you'll see all year. I've bought it three times now, (once for me, twice as gifts for friends) and each time was worth it.\n\nSupport developers like these.\n- Project Kat is a really well polished and fleshed out indie RPG horror game, with tons of cool minor options to make which lead to different endings (there's at least 8), [strike]cuteanimegirls[/strike] likeable characters and a great story to add up to it, despite the Prologue being relatively short. The Steam version of the game offers much more than itch.io does, and both are free, making the game worthy of replaying once again if you have (or haven't) played the itch.io version a while back. Excited to play and see the future chapters soon!\n- There is no skill requirement to play this game; everything seems pretty randomized including when and where the demon attacks you. Its rather difficult to play alone or just with two players. So if your looking for a game to play alone for a fright or just with one other buddy of yours. Make sure your ready to lose, This game has a great concept I just hope it will get more refined with the attacks. It seems like you get killed before you can even attempt to complete the objective.\n- old but gold <3\n- Steam keeps on bothering me to write a review for this game so here's one , i guess.\n\nYou might have heard this ' there's nothing like it on the market ' description of Hunt : Showdown and frankly i must admit that it is mostly spot on. This game is pretty unique and intriguing mix of PVE and PVP within setting which i frankly doubt i ever really saw used in a video game before. We are talking about end of 19th century Louisiana  mixed with paranormal horror activity.\n\nIf you would take a super brief look at Hunt's gameplay loop one could mistakenly assume that it is a battle royal game and while there are few similarities between the two, Hunt has a really original and unique gameplay loop i have never seen done before in a video game.\n\nCore idea here is that you enter a map , which is 1km x 1km square , either alone , in a duo or a trio of hunters and your main goal is to look for clues to locate a boss , kill him , banish him and extract with a bounty. Sounds simple enough , right? But that is there fun actually behinds. Besides having to contend with PVE part of the game , that is various kind of AI controlled zombies ( for the lack of better word ) , number of sound traps like injured animals ,crows ,caged chickens and dogs ( of whom all make loud noises then disturbed in turn giving out your location and even direction you are moving in ) , you are also not alone in a pursuit of that bounty. That is there PVP part of game kicks in .\n\nEven  though this is  PVPVE game , PVE is here only to slow down you rather than being a real threat. Real threat comes from other players who also have same goal as you. Real 'meat' of this game is PVP and while you can choose and avoid PVP all together , you will not have much fun while doing so. Bosses , again , are mostly there to funnel players into the same area to initiate PVP fights.\n\nPVP is rough and tough in Hunt. From what i understand earlier in it's life it was even more hardcore , but even at it's current state this game is not for faint hearted folks. Kill times are low , weapons are mostly single shots so each shot counts ( fitting the settings and time period ) and while on a surface this could look like a simple point and shoot situation there are dozens upon dozens of systems and things to consider in each firefight so you will need tens and in some cases hundreds of hours to really start to feel what are you doing. \n\n I wont lie to you , for first 20 or 30 hours i was pretty much cowering behind stuff in each firefights in essence being a glorified decoy for enemy players while my team mate hopefully was doing something less useless.  Hunt can be really stressful with steep learning curve, perma death ( losing your hunter with all his/her equipment you spent so much money on ) and never knowing who has your in their scopes while crossing open fields but it also can be so very rewarding when you survive a final server wide gunfight on your last bullet and out of healing items. Even 140 hours in some of the firefights leaves me with my heart pounding which is a rare occasion after playing video games and FPS game for more than 25 years now.\n\nThere are of course bunch of technical issues, questionable decisions from the dev team and other negatives associated with any competitive online game so be aware of that before you decide to enter Bayou .\n- solid proof that the story could be the absolute worst garbage imaginable but if the gameplay rules, it literally wont matter. the gameplay in this is bomb-diggity.\n- I was warned a while back not to buy this game because of microtransactions, so I stuck with BTD5 instead. I haven't played much bloons before other than a lot of BTD 3 and 4 back then, but man I was missing out. The microtransactions in this game are nowhere near as bad as people made them out to be. Currently having too much fun with this game.\n- Dear Dev, \nI love this game, if you're reading reviews, please consider some ideas to make it better:\n-  Level designing: Add more ways to choose, and different endings. Right now SoR4 is flat from A to B, it made me feel down compare to SoR3.\n- Alternate customs, and playable same characters: Floyd is overrated and all my friends want to pick him. Make a game with 4 Floyds running sound fun. Use lifetime score to unlock customs.\n- 2v2 Battle! WHY NOT?\n- Shiva (new), Max (new), Roo, Estel (Badass Woman Cop)\n- Steam trading cards: I know it's not importance, but who doesnt want some badass backgrounds on steam profile?\n- Okay so first and foremost the reason why I'm giving this a thumbs up is simple. The game does what it set out to do perfectly. Because of that I have no complaints about it's style.\n\nHOWEVER.\n\nI personally do not like the game. It is my own personal hangup. But I can understand why other people will enjoy it.\n\nThe game is fast paced, level by level FPS with challenges. Almost every single one of them is timed if not all of them are timed. It's similar to Doom or Killing Floor. Only there are no cusomizations implemented at time of play. \n\nThe game is challenging and offers you many different faucets on those challenges. It has different gun types for different enemies, different strategies and all of them complicated and challenging. But that's the point right?\n\nRegardless, the game was pretty fun and if you're looking for a level by level challenge system set to a similar style of Doom then you might just enjoy this game.\n\nIf this wasn't enough for you then please check out the video on my YouTube Channel for a more precise in depth explanation (link below).\n\nThanks for reading and I hope I helped some of you out there to spend your money wisely.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXiok7bhPdY\n- I like furry art, but first and foremost im a RPG gamer, and as such I will rend judgment impartially. \n\nThe story is not bad, but still falls in the average category and it is predictable, gameplay is the same as the first Fuga (I have no problems there) but there are few new enemies,  so the strategy to beat the regular battles is very repetitive. My biggest complain remains the same since Tail Concerto and it is the dificulty... which is way too easy, there is no hard / nightmare mode for veteran players, Im not asking to die repeatedly like in dark souls but Cyberconnect2 needs to understand some players like a challenge in their games.\n\nMusic is ok and Hack is the best character of the lot (Tah tah tah tah  taaah!!!!!) I would play Fuga 3 just for him.\n\nIt pains me to give the thumbs down, but Cyberconnect2 needs to work a little harder.\n- *selects waifu*\n*waifu dies*\n*selects next waifu*\n*next waifu dies*\n*select husbando*\n*husbando dies*\n\nI LOVE THIS GAME!\n- EDIT:\n\nWhile I have played Squad quite a bit for a few years, the large update named \"V6.0 Infantry Combat Overhaul\" unfortunately did not sit well with me.\n\nThe goals for the update:\n\n- Increase length of fights.\n- Reduce the impact of lone wolfs (solo players).\n- Increase emphasis on teamwork mechanics, which mainly meant supression.\n- Increase gunplay diversity, to create choices between optics, since the old meta meant that the magnified optics were greatly outperforming iron sights and holo sights.\n\nWhile I do not disagree with some of the goals, the implementation of them left a lot to be desired.\n\nAfter the update most gunfights became a mess of supression, without either side being able to effetively kill each other beyond 200m.\nGunhandling was also drastically nerfed, creating the sense that your character has never held a rifle before, or even used an optic for that matter.\n\nI can unfortunately no longer recommend this game, since I myself no longer feel drawn to play it.\n\nIf enough changes are made, I may revisit the game and this review, but for now there are better options out there.\n\n\n** OLD REVIEW ** \n\nCan the game be amazing and fun - yes! Do I recommend this for everyone? - No.\n\nThe experience of the game largely depends on what servers / communities you play with. If you play the core game with no moderation (no rules or admins), the game will become a race to make the first unit and lock others out and a race to get armor, then proceed to rush the enemy and end up spawnkilling them near their main spawn.\n\nIf you play on moderated servers with established rules and active admins, then you may experience a great sense of teamplay - other times not so much.\n\nBefore you buy it though...\n\n- Microphone and willingness to use it is REQUIRED for a good experience (People will quickly kick or become hostile towards you, if you do not communicate)\n- This is not battlefield or call of duty, running of solo to pull off 360 noscopes will probably get you kicked/ killed.\n- You will die without knowing from where and you will get into situations in which you have no option to survive, especially if you're new to tactical shooters.\n- You will end up running... A lot..\n- Armor is not like battlefield or call of duty, you need a driver, gunner, commander and possibly a loader (has a machinegun). Where you hit the enemy matters as much as what you hit him with (Armor piercing on his front turret will likely bounce, but even a high explosive may hurt if you can hit him up the rear)\n\nStill here... ?\n\nIf I haven't scared you off, here are my personal tips:\n- Play. The. Tutorial.  Like really...\n- Try different graphic settings, shadows especially makes a big difference in enemy visibility (game looks better with them though)\n- Start as infantry and pick rifleman, but remember to join a squad.\n- Find a server that seems to have active admins and have a ruleset you agree with.\n- Try NOT to give up when you die, generally it isn't worth throwing away a ticket to respawn if you have friendlies within 100m. Sometimes it is the right choice, but before you know which is which, it's a good idea to hold on for a medic.\n- Not all squad leaders know what they're doing, do not be afraid to join another squad if it turns out your squad leader is a fool.\n- Defending is often as important (if not more), than attacking... But you may end up waiting 30 minutes without getting shot at or shooting anyone.\n\n\nAs you can probably tell... Squad is a community based game, with in-depth enough mechanics, while also being easily accessable.\nIf you want a good sense of what the game is, check out some lesser known streamer playing it (bigger streamers will often give you the wrong sense of what a game is like)\n\nHope this helped you make an informed decision.\n\nbut for now there are better options out there.\n- Having currently 1340 hours of playtime and having reached the highest achievable rank (Grand Champion), I can't currently recommend others to follow what I've been doing.\n\nWhile I love the game for it's smooth gameplay and somewhat balanced roster of playable character, the company, Stunlock Studios, are simply not caring for this game the way it deserves. In the start of 2018 we got a roadmap of promised features. This roadmap has since been tossed aside, and the community mocked, as they left battlerite arena development for months to do a battleroyale gamemode, which then turned into a standalone game, which then flopped and as of now has around 1/10 of the active playerbase that Battlerite has.\n\nAs others have also said, the matchmaking is horrible, especially at higher ranks. This can probably be attributed to the low playercount. At the highest ranks, it would not be uncommon to have a queue of 10-15 minutes only to be matched against people at a significantly lower skill level, which then leaves everyone in the match unhappy. This is in Europe, which I believe is the region with the highest playercount.\n\nTo sum it up, I believe this was a game with great potential, which has been wasted by a company with 40 employees, somehow only doing updates like they were a company of 3 people.\n- ROLLBACK NETCODE BABYYYYYY\n- This might literally be the coolest game I've ever played, and possibly the best game that I've played in the last 10 years.\n\nThough, I might be the wrong person to ask though as Earthbound is my favorite game, and this game is obviously heavily Earthbound inspired. Stylistically and comedy wise anyway. The story is much darker than anything in Earthbound, but it's all buried underneath some of the funniest writing I've ever seen in a game. The writing start to finish is amazing, I'm only dissappointed that the game wasn't longer as there's a few questions left unanswered.\n\nI did normal mode, first run, collected all characters and beat the game in 12-13 hours. For 10 dollars, that's pretty alright. The fights are pretty open ended as there are like 20+ characters you can choose from, but I ended up using Rage, Bottles and Mad Dog. I found it wasn't the hardest game I've played, but I also haven't tried pain mode yet.\n\nAnyway, if this game interests you at all, buy it. You won't regret it.\n- I just finished Metro 2033 Redux a while ago, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. One of the best things is that the game is COMPLETELY in a first person perspective, including the cutscenes. Reminded me of Bioshock Infinite a bit in that respect. You are fully immersed in your world. Except for the ending though..for some reason they chose to do a zoomed out pre-rendered cutscene there. \n\nI played on Survival mode (normal difficulty) and the challenge was decent. At one or two points in the game, it wasn't clear to me what to do (probably wasn't paying attention to the dialogues), but I like the no-hand-holding thing. At the last level as well, I ended up running out of filters (pretty sure I scoured all around for supplies and hit the limit many times) so that kinda took away from the experience a bit. \n\nBut otherwise, the story was good. Decent enemy variation. Stealth is possible against humans as well (game doesn't explicitly tell you this IIRC). Just make sure you crouch all the time and turn off your flashlight!\n\nCombat was great as well. The weapon handling felt really good. I found a quad-barrel shotgun and that was massive. Killed all Watchmen in a single shot! \n\nAtmosphere was realistic and well done. Performance was great as well on my humble GTX 750 (with medium settings). \n\nIt's hard for me to find fault with the game. I went in with little expectation, but then again I also don't play much FPS games. This is definitely better gameplay wise than Bioshock Infinite and Spec Ops: The Line though.\n- I have played enough of this game to say that I really, really love it.\n\nI have played every Assassin's Creed game, even the ones on the DS and the mediocre PSP game. This is by far the best Assassin's Creed.\n\nFirst of all, the naval combat is intuitive and really fluid and satisfying. The combat is the same \"Press B to counter\", but the addition of guns and darts do make things more interesting.\n\nWhile most of the time you are at sea \"pirating\", the sections on land are also really good. While the tailing and eavesdropping sessions are frustrating at times and boring at others, the free running is more fluid than ever, with realistic animations and few obstacles that can stop you.\n\nThe story is interesting and does encourage you to play all the main missions. However, there is a huge variety of side missions that can be played as soon as you get your ship to sail the enormous maps, where many ships sail and where whales swim.\n\nI have not played a lot of the multiplayer because I don't find it that interesting and varied.\n\nOverall, this is the best AC game so far: improved gameplay, lenghty and fun, it only makes me more pumped for Assassin's Creed Unity.\n\nSCORE: 90/100\n- I had to purchase Scarlet Hollow after witnessing the excitement of Episode 4 through my friends. I immediately binged the first three episodes the following day and found myself and in rather different spot compared to their playthrough. The choices you make in SH are actually impactful - which is (unfortunately) quite refreshing for the genre! I've since run through several different routes to explore more of the story (and collect those achievements!). While you have the ability to skip through previously seen text, lines within replayed conversations are shaped by your selected traits, choices, and previously selected dialogue; you won't be skipping that many lines before seeing new content. Similarly, characters may be painted in an entirely different light based on choices you've made. The cast and writing truly nails the small town feel of SH (gossip and all). \n\nMake sure you eat the takeaway container in the fridge. Thank me later.\n- It's illegal that this game is free.\n- How the hell did I not hear about this until the very end of 2021?\n\nA beautiful blend of all your favourite action-adventures: Your Zeldas, Metroidvanias, Dark Souls, Megamans (more Zero/ZX), Features local/steam play-together co-op. \n\nThe OST also slaps. I don't expect very moody noir piano in my dystopian cybernetic future but here we are.\n- Do I really have to write this review? I am just one in thousands of people who wrote a positive reveiw for Garry's Mod. Chances are, this review will never convince someone to buy Garry's Mod. It'll just be lost in the 100,000 positive reviews out there. Well, here I go anyway.\n\n\"Where do I start?\" This is the question asked by anyone playing Gmod for their first time. It's also my question that I ask about this review I am writing. Hmm...\n\n_The gameplay...the gameplay...hmm... Well, there's singleplayer sandbox. You can do...uh, whatever you want really. Just addon a few addons, and you can be entertained for hours. Battle NPCs, make cool scenes for cool screenshots, explore maps, be a superhero (spiderman addon!), and much, much, much, much- you get my point, right? Almost all content is user-generated. Make your own content! Multiplayer. In Multiplayer Gmod you can roleplay. I'm talking normal RP (DarkRP), Military RP, Star Wars RP, etc, etc. In multiplayer Gmod, you can battle, prophunt (yay), hide 'n seek, and much, much, more.\n\n_Graphics? I'll rate the graphics...drumroll please... 7/10. This game is and older game. Came out in 2006. I guess the graphics are good for 2006, and people enjoy the game and don't complain much about the graphics, but I'm not gonna lie, they are outdated and look old. It's not 2006 anymore.\n\n_Hear the bullets flying. The zombies growling. The people chatting. The boxes jumping... The sound in this game is great! Every sound is loud and clear, and there are a varitey of sounds.\n\n_Play this game. Play it again. Play it some more. Play some now, and play some later. Play it over and over. Play it as long as you want.\n\n_My Personal opinion. Get this game. Now. Get Gmod on sale or not. I'm not gonna stop playing it for a while and I'm already at 50+ hours of playtime. I love this game! WAIT! Before you go and buy this, then you wonder why there are all the missing maps and errors in most games, get Counter Strike: Source, so ALL the textures are supported. You need it to play MOST multiplayer games.\n\n\nGameplay: 9/10\nGraphics: 7/10\nStory: N/A\nSound: 8/10\nReplayability: 10/10\n\nOverall 8.5\n\nEven though, this is one positive review on Garry's Mod, out of the thousands of positive reviews that have been submitted Garry's Mod, I hope this one convinces you to buy... Gmod\n\n-Star_Hawk_\n- This is one of the most beautiful games I played since Shadow of the Colossus. And much like SOTC This game is a visual delight not all the visual feel pointless or feel to in your face no all of it is PURE atmosphere and really enhances the experience when exploring the many levels in the game. The game's ability to tell a very deep story visually without any dialog or exposition to undermine the player is absolutely brilliant. the game be very diffult the first time playing but feels rewarding after you level up Ori as you continue to fight bad guys.\n\n My rating is 10/10\n A stunning game with a compelling storyline that worth every penny\n- Minutes ago, this reviewer completed the game Gorogoa. And now, an attempt will be made to describe the experience. It won’t be easy…….\n\nIn 1968 this player went to the theatre to see a brand-new movie: 2001: A Space Odyssey. What crossed the screen wasn’t so much a story in the filmmaking sense., but rather an experience. Views of Earth from space (before such images existed IRL), and a final scene that perhaps no one understood, but clearly was meaningful beyond simply the ability, or need, for words to express. Gorogoa left this player with a very similar feeling of inexplicable fulfillment.\n\nGorogoa might be described as a puzzle game, but certainly not in any typical sense. More accurately, Gorogoa is a game about travel, but traversing distance in more ways than just spatially. It’s about travel within, and travel to places unknown (perhaps outside of dreams.) It’s about traveling through space, time, life (and lives), and travel through the experience that is mankind. And perhaps more, it’s about the journey necessary for each player to experience in order to be able to complete the experience that is Gorogoa.\n\nGorogoa provides very little information or assistance, beyond the option for hints about the areas of each image that need be considered for game progress. (It’s difficult to imagine a first-time player succeeding without such hints, so no stigma should be associated with them, especially if they prevent the need for outside resources as may well be the case.) Almost nothing more can be said without compromising some aspect of this game, so this review will be brief, and likely almost as mysterious as the game itself. Learning the goal is as much a puzzle as is the process of reaching that goal. Images are moved, shrunk, expanded, combined, variously manipulated…….ENOUGH! \n\nPlay, and learn about possibilities unimagined until now. In a single word…genius.\n\nThank you.\n\n(As with most Steam games, offline game time is not tracked.)\n- Overall better cast than the first game. But it has a few problems that DR1 didn't have, which to me was what made the game fun in the first place.\n\nDR1 spoilers: [spoiler] All of them seem capable of killing which I couldn't say about the first game where it was obvious that weedman, the giant and donut girl wasn't a threat to you. [/spoiler]\n\nDR2 spoilers:  [spoiler] However unlike the first game where Kirigiri, Byakuya and other characters were arguing during the trial and bringing up interesting points. DR2 has a lack of persuasive characters. There's effectively just Nagito (who argues in your favor half the time anyway) and Chiaki. The other characters never challenges you in a convincing way.[/spoiler]\n- [h1]A True Classic[/h1] \n[u]scroll down for my general consensus[/u]\n\n[b]===[ Audience ]===  [/b]\n☐ Kids\n☐ Everyone\n☑ Casual players\n☐ Pro players\n\n [b]===[ Graphics ]===  [/b]\n☐ Potato\n☐ Terrible\n☐ Bad\n☐ OK\n☑ Good \n☐ Beautiful \n☐ Drop Dead Gorgeous\n☐ Real life\n\n[b]===[ Price/Quality ]===  [/b]\n☑ Full price \n☐ Wait for sale \n☐ Average\n☐ Refund it if you can\n☐ Don't do it\n\n[b]===[ Requirements ]===  [/b]\n☑ 00's PC\n☐ Minimum\n☐ Medium\n☐ Fast\n☐ High end \n☐ NASA computer\n\n[b]===[ Difficulty ]=== [/b]\n☐ You just need 2 arms \n☐ Too easy\n☐ Easy\n☑ Medium\n☐ Hard\n☐ Dark Souls\n☐ Battletoads\n\n [b]===[ Game time/length ]=== [/b]\n☐ Really short\n☐ Short \n☐ Few hours\n☑Normal Runtime (clocking at 15h)\n☐ Long (about 30[i]ish[/i] hours)\n☐ Endless\n\n[b]===[ Blood/Gore ]===[/b]\n☐ No\n☑ Only blood\n☐ Blood and some Graphic Violence but not something extreme\n\n[b]===[ Violence ]=== [/b]\n☐ No\n☐ Mild\n☑ Average\n☐ Violent\n☐ Manhunt\n☐ Mortal Kombat\n\n[b]===[ Soundtrack ]===[/b]\n☐ No\n☐ Annoying\n☐ Better than Despacito\n☐ Good\n☑ Cool and very creative\n☐ Masterpiece\n\n[b]===[ Story ]===[/b]\n☐ No\n☐ Better than Twilight\n☐ OK (more on that below)\n☑ Good\n☐ Fantastic\n\n[b]===[ Bugs ]===  [/b]\n☐ Game itself is one big BUG\n☐ Bugs destroying the game\n☐ Many bugs\n☑ Few Bugs\n☐ No bugs\n\n[b]===[ Others ]=== \nStory: 9/10\nGameplay: 9/10\nSound Design: 8.5/10 ( I didn't like the sound mixing)\nOverall: 9.5/10[/b]\n\n[h1]A true classic.

I never really heard too much about it or even payed to much attention to it; back in my childhood I remember seeing it around the internet but it never really talked to me.\nSo a few years back I bought the whole HL franchise here on Steam, already acquainted with the game's praise. \n\nAfter a couple of failed attempts to play HL2, but getting stuck on the same part, I finally got to finish the game. \nAnd I must say I'm totally on board with all the praise and status!\n\n\n[h1]PLOT:[/h1]\n\nThe story continues after the events of Half-Life 1, where Gordon Freeman, a scientist working on the Black Mesa Research Facility, fights his way through hords of aliens brought to Earth by a portal that Gordon himself opened.\n\nWe wake-up to a dystopian future where the Black Mesa and the alien infestation led to a very different world of ours, where humans live in a opressing society on the likes of the book \"1984\", where everyone is meticulously controlled by the \"system\".\nThis hugely different and creative setting really talked to me and even made me more interested in the narrative.\n\nFrom then on, Freeman tries to lead a group of \"resistence\" fighters to oppose and tear down the ruller of Earth, the former administrator of the Black Mesa Facility, Wallace Breen, (whom also \"negotiated\" a peace agreement with the aliens, right after the events of HL1).\n\nI must say this story is a very creative and different experience of those found in other FPS games.\nI always found myself on the edge of my seat, eager to know what was gonna happen next, and while also amazed by all the environmental storytelling.\nIt's truly one of the game's strongest points and even though your character doesn't speak, you will find yourself completely imersed on the narrative. Even all these years after, this political and social matter that Valve went for and explored is one of the game's strongest points really!\n\nAnd not to forget about all of those fantabulous and explosive setpieces seen throughtout the game that are really solid and entretaining, having inspired other games like Uncharted and the Call of Duty campaigns, just to say a few. You are really put in some tricky and tough situations.\n\n\n[h1]GAMEPLAY:[/h1]\n\nThis is your average FPS gameplay. Nothing you haven't seen before, but HL2 is certainly a gold standard of how to excell and give variety in your gameplay.\n\nYou've got your normal 2000's arsenal, like Pistols, the series' signature weapon the Crowbar, a Revolver that packs a serious punch, an SMG, Assault Rifle, Shotgun (THAT FEELS SO GOOD TO SHOOT), Grenades, Crossbow, Rocket Laucher and a new \"toy gun\" the Gravity Gun.\n\nAt the time, Valve was developing a new physics engine never seen before that went on to shake and revolutionize games at the time, but in order to really make usage of this new technology, [u]the developers of Half-Life 2 introduced the Gravity Gun to the weapons roster [/u]. \nWith it you can \"grab\" multiple objects, such as crates, file cabinets, gasoline tanks or even buzzsaw blades to throw at oponents. It's a very creative way to make usage of the different environment assets while showing off new technology.\nIt's also another tool to help you get out of sticky situations like puzzles, something that Half Life 2 really experiments with. \nWith this engine, Valve pushed the physics to bring different puzzles that just feel natural to solve.\n\nGameplay feels really natural and it's what we have grown accostumed to in the FPS genre, but very competent and polished.\n[spoiler](the shotgun just feels awesome and sooooo satisfying to shoot)[/spoiler]\n\n\n[h1]SOUND AND MUSIC:[/h1]\n\nSound feels like a very big step-up comparing to Half-Life 1 and every weapon sound much better when firing.\n\nEnvironmental sound is really good and pushes you even more to the game's immersion. Every area of the game is masterfully design, to the sewer sections that feel so claustrophobic and tense to walk through, to the more city like big places where you can sense the real sense of scale of the space through the sound design. \n\nI must say it's really top notch.\n\nBut there were times where I felt that the sound mixing was a little off, having sounds playing with a really pumped up volume that really distracted me and put me off.\n\nIn the other hand, the Music is just amazing. It's 00's techno and rock like music that just injects you with such adrenaline and makes you feel really awesome with gunning down opponest. VERY SATIFYING INDEED.\n\n\n[h1]GRAPHICS:[/h1]\n\nIn all honesty this is a hard category to judge, because obviously the graphics are going to look a bit dated to what we have today (in 2020), but honestly everything look really good.\n\nFrom characters and enemies, to the environments, to the fire and explosion effects, it all looks very good and has a great level of quality to them. Specially the alien creatures. I felt utterly disturbed by those \"facehuggers\" like creatures. Everytime they jumped at my face I would equally jump, but of my seat with disgust... \n\n\n[h1]CONCLUSION:[/h1]\n\n[b]To summ it up, I think that Half-Life 2 is a must play game. \n\nReally, if you are like me and you have heard about it, but was like \"meh maybe this game is old and dated and its now crap\", just cut the argument and go play a really good and polished experience.\n\nFor those out there, if you want a polished and strong game that still challenges most contemporary games, with an interesting narrative, and some awesome moments just grab yourself a copy of this. It's dirt cheap, no excuses...[/b]\n- Let's say you capture a prisoner after a bloody raid on your colony. Do you want to:\n\n1. Let them go in the hopes of improving relations with the attackers? YOU CAN DO THAT.\n\n2. Heal them and have colonists talk to them about how great your colony is until they join? YOU CAN DO THAT.\n\n3. Have a colonist with a high medical skill remove their liver to transplant into an alcoholic colonist? YOU CAN DO THAT.\n\n4. Have a colonist with a low medical skill remove their organs just for practice? YOU CAN DO THAT.\n\n5. Eat them because you forgot to stock up on food for the winter? YOU CAN DO THAT.\n\nReally, what else do you need in a game?\n- First steps:\n-set nioh.exe and nioh_launcher.exe to win7 compatibility (if you experience crashes).\n-first level (London) is poorly optimized, so better rush through it and judge the next.\n-experience this game as Nioh and not as a \"Souls\" game, tho I draw comparisons here\n\n\n[h1]Good[/h1]\n\nCombat\nBy far the best thing about the game. You get 7 weapon classes + 3 ranged weapons, and each of the 7 weapons has it's own unique skillset accompanied by 3 different stances. On the fly switching between 3 stances and 2 weapons, or even both at the same time allows for a ton of combinations to chain different attacks and combos. On top of all that you get magic, spirit guardians and ninjutsu. Sky is the limit if you're willing to experiment.\n\n\nBosses\nThe game comes with roughly over 30 unique bossfights, some of them will reappear or be demoted to regular enemies over the course of the game. There are only very few bosses I didn't like. Most of them are going to be human, but that doesn't mean they are boring. Most have sick movesets that make them very engaging and fun to fight, especially the DLC bosses. \n\n\nDifficulty\nJust like Dark Souls the game is as difficult as you want it to be. This means you get alot of tools that allow you to cheese the game. Like summons, or certain character builds centered around spirit guadians and op magic like sloth talisman which makes enemies move in slow motion. \nThe difficulty curve is a falling one, aka the game is more difficult in the begining when you're figuering things out, then it remains on a steady level with occasional spikes upwards. Disregarding bs like sloth talisman I would say the game is overall more difficult than Dark Souls. Combat is faster and mistakes are punished severly, even human fodder enemies can 1-shot you if you happen to take swings when they are in heavy stance.\n\n\nStory\nIt's decent, but nothing special. Nerds interested in the sengoku period to early edo period \nwill probably appreciate the characters and their interactions.\n\n\nWorld\nIt's not an interconnected world like DS1. It is mission based where you pick main or side missions from a map, personally I don't mind the \"arcade\" style. Main missions themself are big levels with multiple shortcuts that loop back to shrines (bonfires). Those levels are bigger than most designated areas in DS3, my guess is like 1.5x-2x the size. If I had to rank the level design... DS1 >>>> DS3 > Nioh >>>>>>> DS2 \n\n\nReplayability\nThe game offers 4 NG difficulties which spice things up by switching enemy placements or giving enemies (and bosses) status effects and new moves. Other than that you get Abyss mode which is most comparable to DMC's bloody palace. \n\n\nMultiplayer/Netcode + pseudo PvP\n3 ways to play mutiplayer: as summon/summoner, co-op missions where both players make progress at the same time and PvP (which is dead).  The Netcode worked quite well for me, even over wide distances like brazil-germany. I never had to adjust for delay and could parry attacks just like offline.  The netcode is quite good imo compared to DS3 where I did lots of co-op at Champion Gundyr and parrying was totally out of the question.\n\n\nThe other \"pvp mode\" is the faction/clan system. You get multiple clans that belong to 1 of the 2 factions. A clan gives you 2 passive buffs that can compliment your playstyle. You obtain glory by killing revenants, succesfull co-op or pvp for your clan. The more glory you obtain, the higher the rank of your faction, clan and yourself. Glory acts as another currency and can be used to buy npc skins, gestures or items.\n\n\nFashion Souls\nLike the look of a particular light armor set but hate getting insta killed by radroaches? No problem, at the blacksmith you can transform any weapon skin or piece of armor, and keep the stats of your preferred equipment. If you get tired of playing as William you can buy npc skins for glory at the teahouse (unlocks at roughly 33% of the game) which is the only way to play as a female as there is no character creation.\n\n[h1]Bad[/h1]\n\nEnemy Variaty\nThe games biggest weakness in my opinion.  Enemy \"species\" come in different flavours, e.g. humans can wield any of the 7 weapons, however this doesn't realy trigger the visual stimulation of seeing something new. Saving grace: the game throws you into different 1vsX situations, so the combination of enemies keeps things interesting, kinda like DMC4 which also has wack enemy variety. I think they could've done much more in terms of creativity when it comes to the yokai/oni realm given the huge amount of lore.\n\n\nRepetition\nSide missions take place in mostly the same batch of areas or in parts of main missions. \nThey try to keep things fresh by switching enemies and spawn points. But they still feel kinda tedious because skipping them isn't realy an option as you can't deny yourself the experience, rewards and loot.\n\n\nMusic\nGood but gets repetitive as only few themes are shared across bosses.\n\n\nFunky Optimization\nSelf explainatory. FPS tanks in London and I had random crashes. The later were solved by the tips mentioned at the top of the review.\n\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nI found the combat mechanics to be more than able to compensate for the games weaknesses (repetition, enemy variety). This means you've to take up responsibility and be creative yourself. If you're the type who doesn't like experimenting and spends 90% of his time with spear in mid stance, and plays like its DS (dodge > R1 > R1 > dodge > R1 > dodge...), then you're gonna get bored quickly. Although, I've seen those guys during co-op all the way up to NG3-4, so who knows... .\n- Ok to make it short.\n\n- Poor graphics (like 10 years old PC game)\nBUT nothing more to complain about.\n\n- great atmosphere, great story, very good fighting mechanics. Of course great price.\n\nIf you have nothing against japan style - just play the game. One of funniest games in some years for me.\n- For a company as big as Amazon, this game is extremely sub par. It feels as though it's in Early Access and some of the recent patch notes are very worrying for the game's future\n\nPros:\n- Stunning gfx. Especially for an MMO, the lighting in particular is amazing\n- Sound track is great and ambience adds personality to the zones\n- Some really cool zones to explore, feels as though you can get lost when you start\n- Controls/Keybinds are already really good imo, I only changed a few\n- Tutorial/Starter Quest chains do a great job of introducing you to the game without being too slow\n- Combat (when it works) Is really fun. Lots of action based fights\n- Wars are a really cool mechanic, they are ultimately flawed but are still a lot of fun\n\nCons:\n- Game is extremely shallow. It is borderline addicting for the first few levels, this soon dies off. When (If) You reach lvl 60, you ask yourself what do you do now?\n- As beautiful as the game is, a lot of it is copy and pasted. Literally. There are zones, towns, dungeons that are almost identical. Ruins immersion\n- Quests are extremely repetitive and boring. They consist of kill mobs, loot mobs, loot chests and that’s about it. No diversity\n- Combat can be laggy, you weapon swap and it doesn’t register sometimes. Wars can be a PowerPoint Presentation at times\n- Guild UI is awful. There is no guild bank, treasury ledger so you cannot monitor who donates money for wars etc. Makes running a guild a nightmare\n- There are countless exploits and duplications that have been abused upsetting economies, player numbers and the general integrity of the game\n- Server population has been decimated since launch leading to many dead servers. They’re merging already\n- There are some very worrying patch notes/future releases that are changing fundamental mechanics of the game. In some cases nerfs which punish players who didn’t rush to level cap\n- Watermark is a stupid progression system for gear. It forces you to run daily elite zone farm chains which get extremely repetitive\n\nIf this was a small indie dev company, I could give them the benefit of the doubt. However this is frickin’ Amazon. This product is totally unacceptable and needs to go back in the oven.\n\n- IMHO this game is highly over-hyped, glad I only spend a few € and bought it at sale.\n\n- Basic concept of dungeon crawling with horror is copied from D&D Ravenloft or Call of Cuthullu. So nothing new here. \n- Story is simple and stereotypical: Old man evokes some unnamed horror in a cursed mansion that curses the land...  \n- Graphics are nicely painted ... but still painted, so outdated concept. It's a indy game, ok ... and maybe some gamers still love playing games on their 386er personal computers from 1990 ...\n- The gameplay itself is IMHO stale, because it's always the same: go into a dungeon. Fight. Grind. Survive.\n- Stress could be an interesting factor, but not in the way it is implemented. In its current form is nothing but a second health bar, which is either difficult or expensive to heal. It makes the game not more complex or more interesting but only more frustrating. Stress could be interesting, if it had different stages with different effects. But in its current form and the difficulty of the game itself it is simply idiotic to take stressed heroes into battle. \n- Random number generator is bad. Really bad. Maybe intentional bad? Who knows...?\n\nThe game itself is grind, more grind, and … grind. Combined with the lame story and the frustration it is a game for masochists and people that want to become one.\n- I've been playing this game since it was in Kickstarter! It is the best Story Rich game that I have ever played and the most unique. I have played through maybe 7 times and it's different every time. The ability to replay this game countless times is what makes it such a great game. Tons of questions that change based on the questions you've asked, you see a question that might not be there after you ask another question instead. Every version of this game that I played kept my interest and had me sitting on the edge of my seat waiting for more. I have reached 2 endings so far and I can't wait to see what happens next. The Developers are great, I can't wait to see what they create next.\n- I play 100+ puzzle games every year and this is likely my favourite release of 2020.\n\nDraknek and his team have truly advanced the state of the art in how the game's world is put together and how exploration and puzzle-solving are interconnected. There is no other puzzle game that does quite what this one does in terms of the interaction between mechanics design, navigation, and secret-finding. It's not just a game about pushing and rolling cylinders around, it's a game about really interesting cause-and-effect relationships between the cylinders, the spaces they're placed in, and the places that you wanna get to but can't.\n\nIf you're a serious puzzle gamer, don't be put off by the game's pastel appearance and the choice of marketing and press quotes that emphasize the soothing or cozy nature of the gameplay. The game's content, including the low-difficulty puzzles, are still very interesting even if you're an experienced puzzle-solver. \n\nThe approachability of the game is achieved by having an \"easy path\" through most of the areas. In this case, easy does not mean \"uninteresting\", but instead means \"interesting puzzles that are rigged so that low-skill solvers are highly likely to stumble upon the solution\". If you're a veteran puzzle-solver, you may not even realize this. It's quite clever. The puzzles off the \"easy path\" are quite challenging (some mind-bogglingly so) and many are incredible feats of design that you will not want to miss.\n\nThe art, sound, and writing are competently executed, and the controls, audio, and visuals do not get in the way of the puzzle-solving. The narrative is entirely flavourtext and is completely irrelevant to the puzzle content, so you can ignore it if you don't care for it (but some of it is hilarious).\n\nThere is one \"thing I wish I knew before I started playing\", and this is that if you want to find all the secrets, you should first rush to complete to the game (get to the credits) before spending a lot of time trying to find secrets. Trying to 100% each area individually during your first playthrough will lead to a lot of frustration and wasted time.\n\nThis game is wonderful. I hope Drak makes an expansion/sequel with another 500+ islands. There are enough unused tricks and unexplored design space here that he could easily fill it (but adding 3x1 logs might also be fun).\n- This is the best Civilization up to this point, and the DLC just made it even better. I will grant that the with all the add ons it would feel a tad crowded to anyone who hadn't played it before, but you have a crazy amount of options. The game series tagline of \"one more turn\" could not be more applicable.\n\nYou can strive for one of several victories: diplomatic, cultural, technological or domination. Each has its unique challengers to overcome and create a lot of the fun of the game. They are also not necessarily mutually exclusive and after completing one victory, you can go for the others. Each AI opponent has their own personality, and are pretty predictable in how they behave. Any one who has started the game next to Neopoleon or Ghengis Kahn knows they immediately have to have a decent military to repel invasion, while Ghandi will to muscle you out with religion and culture.\n\nThere are some important changes between Civilization IV and V. One of the most notable is that wars are plausible again as you dont constantly lose health in enemy territory and cities are easier to conquer. Additionally, culture doesn't automatically take over neighbor's cities anymore. \n\nThis game is easily worth the money. I'm not entirely sure how it stacks up to Civilization VI, but any game that I log 200+ hours on over a period of years and still haven't come close to doing everything is doing something right. A great game from a great series.\n- Homeworld is typically known as the very first 3D RTS -- despite this distinguishing trait, it's not very popular. It's rather obscure, which I find odd for a game that was made with so much love and detail. The story of the two Homeworld campaigns is very nice, the aesthetic of the game is excellent in my opinion, but when it comes to the multiplayer, in vanilla 2.1 Homeworld, the current version, you will face severe balancing issues between the races.\nFortunately, the community has come up with a solution, one that took a lot of time and effort to be. Thanks to them, the multiplayer is now playable with the patch that they made -- the 2.3 players patch. It's still being updated and is worked on by people who understand the overall concept of the game and the genre it belongs to.\nIt's available to everyone in the workshop and is in my opinion (and a lot of others's) the best way to experience both multiplayer and the game itself.\n- Plants, please: A horticultural document thriller.\nGlory to Undermere.\nPros: \n- the writing and its illusion of effortless brilliance\n- attention to detail and consequences for player actions\n- \"gotta catch 'em all\" mentality that actually makes you feel smart\n- the intrigue, world-building, and game flow\n- petting the cat\n\nCons: I wish there was more music, or just none at all most of the time.\n- And that's it, after 278 hours of play, the adventure is over... \nThis type of game that you wish you could forget so you could rediscover it like the 1st time, where you discover everything, a bit like a child\nIt's a game made with passion for video games, to tell a story, to make the player laugh too, and to make him a little melancholic or horrified or even sickened sometimes\n\n[u]Divinity OS 2 will have marked my young adult life[/u], like Sonic and megadrive games, Pokémon, FFTactics, Zelda and gameboy / gamecube games, Warcraft3 (TT), or Mass Effect and other PC games did in my childhood and adolescence (I surely forget so much excellent games)\n\nIt's a 20/20 for me. The work is titanic. The game is really made with passion. The studio is very talented.\n\nSo when Steam asks me [i]\"Do you recommend this game\"[/i], I say:\nYes! Because this is where you feel that video games are an experience, an adventure to live! \nI went through Rivellion with my buddy, like I went through Kanto (Pokémon), or Ivalice in FF Tactics as a kid!\n\n\n[u][b]Atmosphere:[/b][/u]\nMany of us probably remember our adventures in Pokémon or other games in our childhood. We roamed, discovered and lived in these worlds!\n\nHere, it's the same thing, and not alone this time: I was with a very good friend! \nWe met frequently to venture into the world of Divinity as a lightning lizard warrior or a skeletal assassin with a mysterious past...\n\nWith our companions Lohse and Ifan, and Maladie, and Gareth, and Jahan and Han the survivor kid and Sir Lora and so many others. Impossible to forget... \n[i]They exist! Stop lying, I know they exist ![/i]\n\nOur choices were important: We decided to do justice to this or that person, provoking reactions (or death) in certain characters, slapping a few Magisters around when necessary\nAnd of course, we STRONGLY decided to stea... Borrow a lot of spells and equipments from the merchants, while the other one was distracting by chatting...\n... What? We didn't have the money and we had to save the world ! Well, we had the money, but you never know, maybe one day we will need it... !\nAnd then stealing, it's fun. And exhilarating hehehe\n\n\n[u][b]Gameplay:[/b][/u]\nA 3D tactical turn-based game, to play with friends. Really ! Don't play this game alone, I'm sure that with at least 1 buddy (or 3!), you will exploit the game to its full potential!\n\nAlso, [u]you can change your skills and class at any moment in the game[/u], it's very flexible ! I played rogue all my game, and in the last chapiter, I decided to play with spear and War skills ! I really enjoyed being able to switch like this, as I want ! The game want you to take FUN, not \"suffering\" your \"bad\" class choices !\n\nToo bad, I don't know anyone who is ready to take on the role of a GM (Game Master), to live a personalized campaign! Because it is a mode apart from the main campaign!\n\n\n[u][b]Music:[/b][/u]\nExtremely good and fits perfectly with the atmosphere of the game. This kind of OST that we listen to when we work and that makes us live our adventures again when the song becomes EPIC!\n\n\n[u][b]In summary:[/b][/u]\nTitanic content, assured re-playability for those who wish to know what would have happened if they had answered something else than \"FIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT\", and I repeat, the fact of being able to play with friends makes the game so much more pleasant to do!\n\n\n[b]*Sob*[/b]\nBut no, I'm not crying... I'm just allergic to emotions!\n\nI would like so much to forget this game to be able to rediscover it\n\nPlease play it, at least give it a try, and let yourself be immersed in Div's world!\n\nIn our case, we will do it again in HARDCORE mode !\n\nPeace guys !\n- This is the fighting game that you give to a friend who doesn't play fighting games to learn, the Steam Edition of Killer Instinct comes with all of the characters as well as the extra premium skins that were added into the game. Killer Instinct has arguably one of the best tutorial systems that I have played with in recent years, if not one of the best period. It allows you to learn at a reasonable pace each and every one of the specific features of the game, including assists so that people are able to learn what combo breaker they need to use versus specific attacks. Combo Assist in this is less a crutch or a hand hold mechanic and more of a guide when it comes to using combos, it will automatically add in linkers to combos so that people who are unfamiliar with the game aren't left mashing buttons and making a fool of themselves because they don't know what they are doing, it will free flow the fight as best as it can to help guide people toward what they need to be doing, showing off what specials people could be doing to link the combo together and maximize the amount of damage they could possibly get, and due to the combo meter it stops people from being locked into combos forever since once a combo ends you are forced away, either by the opponent's combo ender or the combo forcing itself closed.\n\nThe price that they ask for on Steam you will get more out of the game than you could expect from something this priced. There are two story modes specific to the first two seasons of characters that came out, then with Season 3, which brought back the two original bosses from the franchise, Shadow Lords, a seperate scenario style campaign in which you pick the team that you wish to take in your attempt to overthrow the Shadow Lord himself. That's without taking into account the Shadow Lab mode which allows you to train a Shadow of yourself, an AI that learns and builds off your own patterns to fight in a similar manner to yourself, these Shadows are used within its own unique survival mode, as well as special missions that can crop up within the Shadow Lord mode.\n\nIf you're after a fighting game to get into, or you're looking to get a friend into fighting games, this is the best one that you could possibly start with, since it will not only teach the specific mechanics to this one, but also allow you to learn in time a lot of the mechanics that other competitive fighters share, though this one, eases you into it, so that it is a less daunting experience, as well as being much friendlier to new players.\n- This version comes bundled together with some kind of horrid bloatware called \"Steam\" which functions as a type of DRM meaning you do not actually own the game. Avoid at all costs, buy it on CD instead!\n- Honestly I don't think I've ever cried so much over one game.  This is definitely one of the best narrative driven RPG maker games ever made - it has everything you could want.  It has beautiful art, beautiful music, wonderful narration, it's atmospheric, great characters, meaningful choices, a story of overcoming hardships similar to a real life instead of just a story, and the ending I got was beautiful! I have only played the game once but the game has a lot of different branching paths with choices really making a large difference in the game.  This game will always have a special place in my heart.\n- So, I hated this game at first...\n\n I've never been into a MMO before, and I went into it with a mindset of \"FUCK YEAH! MULTIPLAYER SKYRIM LETS GO\" - In short don't do that. This isn't going to be like playing Skyrim, Oblivion, Morrowind. \n\nIt is when it all comes down to the core an MMO, it's set in Tamriel, it sounds like Tamriel and the storylines feel like an Elder Scrolls game. However being an MMO, it has a lot of grindy MMO style quests. And don't get me wrong, it's bewildering at first, all these mechanics, all these places to go....and before the 'One Tamriel' update if you chose the wrong faction, you were screwed, in a place all on your own surrounded by all these people who are WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY higher level than you. But thankfully they changed all of that. The game scales now, so you can rock up to a dungeon with your level V300 mate, and still have some fun slicing up enemies.\n\nSo I saw a friend playing the other day, and spent a few hours installing this to join him (By the way its like 70 Gig...If you have slow internet prepare for a few days of download), I got back on it after not playing for 14 months, but this time I was playing with a friend who was already Veteran Level 250, So I was in luck, he introduced me to everything and I got used to all the deconstructing of equipment to get my blacksmithing up, showed me about dungeons and bascially got me to enjoy the grind. I think my previous time was a bit lackluster because I got dropped in the middle of the Aldmeri Dominion on my own, without any of my friends. So I left.\n\nNow I know what I'm doing, and keep in mind I usually hate MMO's never played WoW or anything like that, this is the first one. I'm enjoying myself, I'm triple digits into this game time-wise and I don't see it stopping now. We've made a guild for noobies. To help them out, and get them to enjoy the game also. Because the community is nice...but you still get the elitist fucks from any competitive game kicking you out of dungeons because you're only level 14. But you won't get that when you're in a guild, having people to play with and explain all the mechanics did help, a lot. I've even gone as far as to buy this AGAIN on steam just to collect my hours and so on.\n\nAdd-ons are awesome being able to mod basic features of the game to help with information and quality of life improvements is a must. I'll provide an essential mods pack if any of you wish to know.\n\nFor those of you who actually got this far into this, well done. I didn't think I'd keep you captivated long enough to get to the end.\n\nIf any of you are new to the game, on EU server and would like to join a guild to show you the way, add me or visit our [url=www.godsofsalt.com]website[/url] and join us on teamspeak, or just message us in game @diseasedcrow.\n\nBut all in all if you like Elder Scrolls and you think you want to try this, just do, I'm glad I gave it a second chance.\n- This game looks incredible and I'm really enjoying the story so far. It does have some bugs still, but nothing I've come across has particularly bothered me, much less ruined the game. It's incredibly immersive and detailed, the voice acting is really good, and the gameplay is fun.\n- As a fan of Mimimi's Stealth Strategy Game,\nI love it so much, the operation system is getting smoother and more user-friendly comparing to Desperados III & Shadow Tactics.\nAlso I like how they added new elements to the game to make it more playable (E.g. Flexible team choice, character stories)\n\nThe only thing I don't like is the art.\nGame design is good but it'd be great if there's good looking characters...\n- Horrible game couldn't learn how to drift in 13 hours i was using a wheel btw apparently its harder but like wheel is cool I'm not gonna play it on controller that's lame. My dad also couldn't drift either and he knows how to drift irl. I also cant get a refund because i spent so long try to drift :(\n- As i previously stated, i was going to play through metro fully and i have done so, so here is my update to this review. \nThis game is not the best selling triple A game in the world and it may have some bugs (like a table that wasnt solid or the objects in that room lol) however it is a decent game. the story is decent and the characters voices are way off but they sorta make up for it with their personalities. \n\nExploration in this game is by far one of the most interesting in my opinion and the way your character acts in the enviroment makes it more interesting aswell, for example wiping your visor when it gets dirty (wasnt that helpful for me in my play through but it was a nice touch) and your visor taking damage in combat adds to the immersive feel of this wasteland/paradise almost. Scavenging weapons and parts and combining them to make better equipment is quite intriguing and quick to do if you can find the parts. \n\nat the end of the day my final review of this is its a good game i would play it again even if it is a bit clunky sometimes (atleast it was for me lmao)\n\n\n\n\n\nOh and hopefully my punctuation is good enough so no one passes out this time lmao\n- \nWell, after almost a year of not playing this game, I must say, the devs did fix most of my issues. *Most*. Creative mode is fun, but you still need to collect stuff to make things, which is incredibly tedious. On top of that, the character dialogue is still really annoying and you need a NASA computer to play at a stable framerate, but hey, you can actually play without getting your ass beat. I'd like to up my ranking to an 8/10. Very fun, but I highly recommend playing with others. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOG REVIEW (outdated):\nThis game has potential, but unfortunately having fun with it is impossible if you aren't a hardcore survivalist.\n\nCritical Issue #1:\nThe main characters won't stop talking. Everytime you eat or hold the torch they say an unfunny one-liner that makes me want to gouge my eyes out with forks. Even Robin Ayou from Subnautica: Below Zero talked less, and the original game had a silent protaganist. Having characters that have constant dialogue that always repeats is just so annoying to the point where I had to turn off the volume. If the main characters were silent but atleast talked with each other, then I could see potential in that. But they just talk and talk and talk and none of it means anything.\n\nCritical Issue #2:\nThe enemies are way too hard to battle. To make better gear, you need to take on enemies that are so difficult to battle. Maybe you could say I'm just not good at battling enemies in survival games, but I was able to easily battle monsters in Terraria, Minecraft, Subnautica and Raft just fine. When your in-game monsters are too hard to defeat without gear that requires you to battle even MORE monsters, it is not fun, repetitive, and frustrating.\n\nCritical Issue #3:\nThe story is in the background. The fact that the story doesn't impact the game as much as it should is probably the worst aspect of any piece of media out there. The game sends you an a goose chase to find the  main story and it is infuriating. The story itself is all over the place. First it just seems like you need to make yourself grow bigger, but then it goes completely off the rails and into this scientist bunker with a robot that gives you quests, but you can ignore him and continue playing. I don't know if they finished the story, but so far it is not good.\n\nSomewhat Critical Issue:\nThere is no setting to dial back the graphics without lowering the resolution to look like Terraria. I can't see, and it is dumb and brings the whole beautiful vibe of being small down, ironically.\n\nMinor Issues:\nThe music is bland, and although I love electronic/synth music, this is just not it. The fact that you can't have bugs as pets or mounts, or even herd them is extremely upsetting. The farming sucks ass, it gives you 4 items of what you grew every 2 in-game days, when you can just find that item in more abundance at the place where it is located. Under the pond... JESUS CHRIST, the graphics are so bad. The wavy filter looks so bad, and you can see the entire underwater area crystal f**king clear, even though other smaller bodies of water have some kind of murkiness to it. Minor issues like this hold back the game.\n\nAlthough this is still in early access, it feels as if they wasted a lot of potential already. For such a unique world and concept, it never really exploits the amazing and obvious things that it can accomplish. Why not grow your own personal army of ants? Oh sorry, you can pick up eggs but they hatch and they aren't friendly. Why not create a raft made of weed stems and lilypads? Oh sorry, you can just build a base that looks like a boat. Although there are much worse steam games out there, and ones that I have hated more than this, this was sort of a slap to the face. It's not god-awful, and there are a lot of good things about it like the cartoony bug designs and the beautiful graphics, but honestly, it's a 6/10 bordering on a 7, and although many others have enjoyed this, being the super critical demogorgon that I am, this didn't exactly \"ground\" me.\n- To date, AirMech is the closest thing to a fun MOBA-strategy hybrid I've ever played. Unfortunately, after I came back to this game recently, I have to change my review from Highly Recommended to Not Recommended (this is solely for AirMech Strike, and not related to Wastelands, its PvE counterpart, which I will do a review on at a later date).\n\nTowards the end of 2012, the game was doing really well. There were 500+ players online on average, and it was real easy to get a match.\n\n(+) PVP was simple. Choose your airmech, pilot, unit list, and one item that gives a certain minor bonus. Cosmetics are optional and offer no advantage.\n(+) Player Market introduced later on for trading cosmetic items.\n(+) Badges for people who supported the game.\n(+) Diamond rolls in the chat where players can randomly win Diamonds.\n\nHowever, some downsides also happened.\n(-) You need to pay fees to list an item on the market, using Diamonds, instead of Kudos.\n(-) Books were introduced to either increase trade slots and decrease fees. You needed to spend more Diamonds on these books.\n(+/-) Parts were introduced, adding buffs/debuffs to your AirMechs, though I personally preferred to limit stat customization to Pilots and Items, keeps things simple.\n(-) Nanoforge was introduced for crafting, but is a complicated mess. This wasn't necessary if the game itself wasn't so complex.\n\nWhen AirMech split into AirMech Strike and AirMech Wastelands:\n(-) Parts, Pilots and items were transferred to Wastelands. RIP customization for PVP.\n(+) Keys now available via daily login rewards (the only improvement I've seen).\n(-) Airmech balancing is way off. Once simple skills are now too specific, and there's no need for an ultimate skill, really. AirMech was fine without it.\n\n5 years later and the peak is just over 100 players. The devs took a simple fun game and made it so incredibly complicated that it's no longer a fun game, for me at least.\n\nI hope Carbon Games brings AirMech closer to the late 2012 version, which I feel is the best and most fun version.\n- Guys this game is brilliant!!\n\nIf you have the chance and you like nostalgic and engaging exploration and mystery solving, I promise you won't regret buying this one.\nI honestly kept searching for more games like this at Steam and I was not able to find any that were this good.\n\nThe pixelated artwork is >very< detailed.\nI don't know how to describe it, but every scene feels like it's straight out of a framed vintage painting that you'd see in a farm cottage made by the grandfather of the previous owner. It just has this vibe, and I love it.\n\nAll characters are voiced and the VAs did a really great job, especially the main VA. Sarcastic, funny and witty lines are all over, as well as capturing the weight of each life, of their memories, and when they share their stories.\n\nYou won't regret playing this one! Go ahead, and have a great excavation...\nDon't forget: the answer lies in the soil...\n- OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR!\n\nHow can it be a hate crime if my client loved doing it?\n- Would I recommend DBD? ...It's complicated.\n\nDead By Daylight is an unique experience of asymmetric hide and seek/tag with shifting rules. \nIs the game fun? Yes. Is it creative? Yes.\nIs it fair and enjoyable? Well, it depends.\nGames get very intense, and playing as killer is some of the most intense gaming experience I've ever accumulated...\nWhich is where things often go wrong. The survivors seem to have decided that the killers have to honor strict code of rules. Don't use these items, these abilities, or these strategies. If you do, you'll be insulted after the game.\nIf you follow these rules, the odds are that you will spend the game running in literal circles, the survivors will win, t-bag you at the gate and then insult you after the game. I don't know about you, but that kind of ruins the game for me. It is actually kind of amazing how helpless one can feel in this game.\n\nSo to conclude my thoughts; I really like the game, but I also really hate it. I can't recommend it, as every time I fire it up, there is about 50% chance I feel more harassed, than entertained.\nI play a lot of online games, from League of Legends to Tekken, but this is the only one that makes me frequently think: \n\"I should really uninstall this\"\n\nEdit: \nI returned after a long break, and I still kinda like the game. \nHowever, same pattern repeats whenever I return. Eventually, I get teabagged one time too many and uninstall the game. The game is fun, the community could not be much worse. And sadly, that often ruins the experience.\n- 1/10 play time is afk card farming\ncould not even finish one level\ncrashed on me when i just started building stuff every time\ndidn't even make it to seeing the enemy in game ever\n- ULTRAKILL is a fine game with cool movement mechanics. However most of the guns don't feel beefy at all and, really, there's not much content to be had. Wait for ACT 3 before forking out $20 for this.\n\nedit: after getting every p rank, gaming\n- [h1] 🕘          IMPRESSION:[/h1]\n* 2016: Game released\n* 2019: It seem fun, let's buy this\n* 2020: New content added\n* 2022: More content added\n\n🟢 = Available\n🔴 = Not available\n\n[h1]         GAMING CONTENT:[/h1] \n🟢 Teamwork with others\n🟢 Puzzle Challenges\n🟢 No Compass or Map Challenge\n🟢 Funny Avatar\n🟢 Customize Avatar\n🔴 3-4 players share screen\n🔴 Fast Sprint\n🔴 Time Attack for replay value\n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [th]iMeter[/th]\n        [th]SCORED[/th]\n        [th]iNTEREST METER[/th]\n        [th]DISCOUNT?[/th]\n [th]COMMUNITY[/th]\n        [th]REVIEWER[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [th]A+[/th]\n        [td]5[/td]\n        [td]Loving it [/td]\n        [td]No Wait[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [th]A[/th]\n        [td]4[/td]\n        [td]Liked it[/td]\n        [td]No Wait[/td]\n        [td] ✔[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [th]B[/th]\n        [td]2-3[/td]\n        [td]Half satisfied[/td]\n        [td]Wait 50%[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n        [td] ✔[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [th]C[/th]\n        [td] 1[/td]\n        [td]Less Interested[/td]\n        [td]Wait 75%[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [th]D[/th]\n        [td] 0[/td]\n        [td]Not what you need[/td]\n        [td]Wait 100%[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n        [td] -[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n\n🏅 Community Rating: [b] Very Positive [/b]\n🔎 Long Version Checklist ➜ [u][url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/expectationchecklist/discussions/1/1738883005311884039/]Reveal[/url][/u]\n📢 Disclaimer about Short Hours & English Error ➜ [u][url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/expectationchecklist/discussions/0/4594180031254224809/]Read Here[/url][/u]\n\n[quote]\n⚖️ iMeter {B} Worth a play, if you enjoy Teamwork Challenges with Puzzle.

Better played with friends. Really brilliant gameplay idea. I just hope it gets a final ending really soon!\n\nEdit: After reaching the ultimate end, I felt bit disappointed. The progress was just straight up boring and uninteresting after years of restarting again and again.\nVery fun game anyways\n- A lot of people's main complaint's seem to be about microtransactions. The game is perfectly playable without spending a dollar other than what you spent on the base game. And it's really not P2W. mostly aesthetic. Dedicated servers would be nice. but I feel they could fix this by better host migration. It is rather annoying when in a 4v4 and the host gets tilt and breaks the match by leaving, losing all the exp earned.\n\nTL;DR people are mad about spending extra money but want dedicated servers for free? =/\n\n*EDIT* after spending a few hours practicing, I now get told to kill myself on a regular basis in duels.\n\n11/10 Git Gud\n- One of the better RPG maker games i've seen and played, especially considering it was made on RPG Maker 2003. The beginning of the game was great and felt like there was a ton of potential, but a lot of the overworld mechanics were underutilized (jumping, swimming, orb flying). The writing was alright in the beginning, but started to turn into a bad fanfic in the middle/end of the game. The ending was... wholly unsatisfying and abrupt. It made very little sense, and did absolutely nothing to answer any questions asked at any point in the game, rather asking brand new questions and providing no resolution for any of the characters. You'll get about 10-14 hours of this game, which is kind of amazing for an RPG maker game, but honestly, steam has SOOOO many better titles available in this price range that unless you're into RPG maker, you should go elsewhere.\n- You know that feeling when you are hesitant to buy a game because you're worried you might waste your money on something that might be a crap game in the end, get boring, and not sure if you should believe all the ratings because you dont know if everyone has the same interests and likes as you? well this game is the bomb diggity, straight up. Made by the same people who made rollercoaster tycoon and man did they deliver on this. For me it's the small things in a game that matter and did they really take the time to make sure this was as polished as it could be. Not sure if anyone remembers when they announced another rollercoaster tycoon a while back, and everyone was super excyited to find out what it was, and it ended up being some dumbass phone app? Well imagine all that excyitment, but instead of them coming out with that stupid app they came out with this bad boy. This is exactly what everyone was wishing and hoping for (just different name). Do I reccomend you buy this game? hell yes. will it be exactly what you are wishing for when you fist clicked this game to see the game play and reviews? sure as cocks will. But will it be just as fun as the original?.... YOU BET YOUR MOMS TITS IT WILL BE. \n\nPROS:                                \nbeen one since 1990\n\nCons:\nYou'll never know how fun it is till you buy it.\n- BABA IS YOU\nGAME HAS PUZZLE\nPUZZLE IS CHALLENGE AND NOT UNFAIR\nPUZZLE IS FUN AND LOGIC\nGAME HAS MUSIC AND GRAPHIC\nMUSIC IS CHARMING\nGRAPHIC IS CHARMING AND CUTE\nGAME IS RECOMMEND \nGAME IS GOOD\nBUY IS WIN\n\n【グループB】\n- This game taught me about the diversity of cultures that our small little corner of the universe offers.\n\nThen it taught me to hate them all.\n- Wait. So you are telling me that I have to purchase this faction as well as US & OBERKOMANDO to play offline VS AI?? WTH is wrong with gaming companies nowadays?\n- A Visual Novel meets The Stanley Parable by way of Disco Elysium. This game contains a shocking amount of depth of content and thematics behind it's excellent voice acting and 3-colour sketchy visual style. Well worth a play if you're intrigued.\n- Portal is a first person puzzle platformer where you are testing science with portals guided by GLaDOS.\n\nThe game is a classic for a reason. It uses portals as the main puzzle mechanic and combines other mechanics with the portals such as falling and gaining momentum to launch at a higher speed through the other portal. The levels gradually build up with complexity, but are never too frustrating and half of them are done with access to only a single portal. The puzzles have great visual clarity with the mostly white colors and decent visual cues on how it should all work out.\n\nPortal has the classic Valve way of telling stories, as things are already happening before you get there. You are woken up to follow instructions for the testing purposes of GLaDOS, but you are also figuring out if maybe there isn't a role better suited that could fit you. It's an enjoyable mystery leading you on without forcing it's way in.\n\nGoing back from Portal 2 to Portal made me aware of the improvements to the overall gameplay. Exiting through portals in Portal makes the camera rotate in a weird way sometimes and the levels are generally designed to be slower pace than what Portal 2 offers.\n\nIf there is one thing I didn't enjoy, it's the advanced and challenge levels. Figuring the harder puzzles is one part of the challenge, but executing them relied on tight timings where the puzzle mechanics they rely on felt too clunky to be fun.\n\nFor achievement hunters:\nTwo playthroughs are required with 2 sets of collectibles, one of which requires to be done in one go, a few challenges through the story and completing the advanced and challenge levels that can be console cheesed. Guided here https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2008271826\n- In terms of originality, this gets a zero.  It's a Robotron clone with pretty graphics.  There have been many of these, and my personal favourite is the original Mutant Storm which is sadly no longer available to buy.  However, the graphics are really really pretty, and the game play is really really good.  So for being the best implementation of the Robotron idea to date it gets a big thumbs up!\n\nSuggestions where it could be improved:\n[list]\n    [*]Graphics are so pretty they do sometimes make it hard to see what's going on.  Maybe have a less pretty looking mode.\n    [*]4 player co-op\n    [*]Online co-op\n    [*]Ability to save/pause arcade mode so you don't have to play through entire game in single session.\n[/list]\n- I hate to do this, because the devs clearly put a lot of love into it, but I just can't give it the thumbs up.\n\nThe controls are mostly on point (slide jumping is a little weird), but the generated levels are what kills it for me. I've come to realize that getting through the hand-crafted levels is a good portion of what makes Mega Man so fun. This procedural generation simply isn't up to snuff. You just go right, occasionally going up or down to go right again. There's no nuance or thought required to go right, because most enemies can be ignored, and there are no real obstacles. \n\nIf you've got that itch, just replay a Mega Man game (Classic/X/Zero). You'll go through proper, hand-crafted levels.\n- I don't understand why everyone is saying to stay out of the house? I went inside, they were super nice loving and caring people. The dude that owns the place is a butcher and has all kinds of quality meat. We had BBQ and showed me around the wheat farm. And his grandma, she can't see or hear very well, but she's incredibly sweet. They're both looking after a baby that's ABSOLUTELY ADORABLE!\n\nI don't get what all the fuss is about, I enjoyed my visit.\n- This is a game that I have been looking forward to for at least 2 and a half years. I have wanted to have a game on the PC that had the elements of harvest moon (for the little bit I played of it), Animal crossing (<3) and Rune factory. I was super excited when I was approached by Leth (publishing manager at Chucklefish) at the beginning of December to help him and ConcernedApe (developer of the game) with bug testing and QA. 400+ hours later (off steam and on steam), I still love the game. \n\n[b]Farming.[/b] The farming is fantastic. It is to me one of the main elements of the game, and it's just a joy. Being able to design your farm any way you want it... yes please. Planning out what to buy every season, where to plant them, on top of the thrill of when you can harvest and reap on the gold... it's so enjoyable and addictive. \n\n[b]Fishing.[/b] The fishing is outstanding. From playing WoW and Runescape.. or any game with fishing, the fishing in Stardew Valley is so much fun. At first, the fishing is challenging, but as you progress your skill, you become a pro in no time.\n\n[b]Mining and combat.[/b] Mining and combat is incredible. Going deeper into the mines can be tough, but if you're prepared with your food and weapon in hand, you can fend off the creatures and get your sweet ore/minerals/gems that you want to bring back to your house and possibly hoard. (Hi, I'm Bexy, and i'm a hoarder.) \n\n[b]Social.[/b] Social interactions are great. Being able to become friends with the people in the town,  and eventually being able to get into relationships with people and having a family with them.. what's not to like about that? And what's great is that it gives great replayability because you can have different saves with different spouses! The backstory for each of the characters too is so in depth and well thought out, you will be silly if you don't shed a tear maybe once or twice. \n\n[b]Main story.[/b] The actual main story is well rewarding, and once you \"complete\" it, you can still continue on your adventures and farming life with no problems, hell you might even discover new things afterwards, I sure as hell did! \n\nYes, I was a tester for the game. Yes, I have played for ridiculous amounts of hours. It may feel like i'm being a bit overzealous with this. However you have to remember, I was a tester. I tested the crap out of every aspect with this game, even though there were massive game breaking bugs, errors, glitches, crashes. I still love this game. I reported many a bug, and ConcernedApe was quick to fix them. \n\nAnd that's the thing, not only is the game amazing, the developer is too. ConcernedApe works around the clock to make sure that bugs are fixed in quick time in order for us to have an amazing experience with this game. And that's true. The experience that you have with this game IS amazing. \n\nMinutes playing turn into hours. Hours turn into \"oh no it's time to sleep\".\nYou will forget about time. You will forget about sleep. You will forget that dinner was about 5 hours ago but you couldn't' remember because you were too busy trying to fight off 12 bats that were clobbering you inside the mines while trying to gather that 1 diamond waaaaay in the back. \n\nSo yes, I without a shadow of a doubt 150% recommend this game to anyone that wants to \"escape\" for days on end with what I am classifying as my #1 Game of 2016.\n- This is more of a personal opinion than a useful review, but I would like to share my experience with this game! At the beginning I was very disappointed... I was hoping for a Phoenix Wright competitor, but it wasn't even close! The investigation was so silly, the game doesn't let you leave the scene before you find all the clues, you can't \"weist\" your time going to places not related to the case and the trial doesn't start until you have all you need... the only way to fail is not having coordination to shoot the bullets xD The game takes you exactly where it wants.\nThe first trial was also so obvious I almost gave up playing. BUT THEN... things started to get strange. During my second trial I was \"that is what happened... I mean... I guess...\" and during the third trial I had no fucking idea what was going on D: The story got so deeper and full of details. Each chapter revealing new secrets, showing how complex the plot was!\nI realized that I shouldn't see Danganronpa as a poorly investigation game that wasn't that challenging, but as an amazing novel with such a rich story! The gameplay became secondarly compared to how envolved I was with the whole scenario! The further you go, more incredibly enjoyable it gets. So, for those who didn't like the game for this very reason, give a second chance with another point of view :) enjoy it's fabulous mysteries and you will not regret unreaviling it's secrets!\n- If you played the OG this is basically the same but with a few added side stories you can unlock as you complete different routes in the game. The extra dlc maybe would take you a bit over an hour to complete all of them if you speed through it, but does not have any optional dialogue so it's more of just some lore and extra character interactions. Still pretty solid dlc if you are a fan and want a little bit of extra stuff :)\n- Has combination of tight controls and well designed levels that makes platforming satisfying, excellent graphical style and music, as well as tons of unlockable content that will keep you playing even after finishing the story.\n\nVery solid platformer.\n\nThe only downside is there's no online coop; only local.\n- As a fan of Mimimi's Stealth Strategy Game,\nI love it so much, the operation system is getting smoother and more user-friendly comparing to Desperados III & Shadow Tactics.\nAlso I like how they added new elements to the game to make it more playable (E.g. Flexible team choice, character stories)\n\nThe only thing I don't like is the art.\nGame design is good but it'd be great if there's good looking characters...\n- Update circa Feb 2017: PLEASE READ!\n\nIt's been brought to my attention that there is a code for unlocking all the characters and stages in the game.  One of the main reasons I could not recommend this game at all on release was that, as far as I knew, it was not possible to unlock all single-player content without multiplayer modes (versus), which requires an extra controller.  As this is NOT the case, I can recommend this game if it is on sale (50% off or more, and it has been 75% off previously) and you look up the code.  If it matters, you will still need to fufill normal unlock conditions for achievements.\n\nThe game still sorely needs an online mode, has no AI for versus, and is not quite a pick-up and play title.  The two times I've returned to this game after a long absence, it has taken me a while to relearn the controls, an issue I don't frequently have with other games.  This may not be a problem if you play often enough, or with a controller.\n\nMy outdated review can be seen below\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you can gather 1 to 3 people for local multiplayer, then feel free to buy this game.\n\nHowever, if you plan to play this game by yourself, make sure you have a spare controller before purchasing this game.\n\nWhy?  Because even with a keyboard, a controller is required to play Versus mode, and certain content (at least 3 map sets and all 4 extra characters) can not be unlocked unless you can access Versus mode.\n\nIf you do not have a controller, you will not be able to unlock all single player content.\nIf you do not have a controller, you will not be able to unlock all the content in a game you paid for.\n\nI would change my stance on this game in the future if either:\n1)  The ability for a single player to fight against the AI in \"versus mode\"  is added\nor \n2) An online mulitplater mode is added  \nThe second option may be a little unreasonable, but the first isn't.\n\nEither of these would allow players to play versus mode without a controller, thus giving them the ability to unlock game content that is currently unaccessible with just a keyboard.\n- WHERE ARE MY OG DS FANS OF THIS GAME? REJOICE BRUDDAS!\n\nNo but seriously, I loved this game to DEATH when it first came out on the DS and to now see an HD version of this game on steam. It's quite a whiplash but a good one! To anyone who loves mystery/ detective games, YOU NEED TO GET THIS!!! Good story, soundtrack and gameplay <3 AHHHHHH!!!\n- Whoa. Wow. I was really impressed with this game. And really immersed too, where did those 20 hours even go...\n\nAt its core, TRI is a first-person puzzle platformer with relatively small levels jam-packed with secrets to find, on top of the main collectibles. The difficulty curve is pretty smooth, but steep; the game expects you to think outside of the box and be very aware of what you can and can't do. There's a ton of clever level design and puzzle design, and a lot of variety too. \n\nThere are a few minor flaws; chapter 13 is kind of ehh bad. Dying to acid or lasers makes you reload a save, which seems a bit much. Granted you'll end up saving a ton once you get to levels where you can die just so that doesn't happen, and usually it's only a minor inconvenience, but I don't see why it had to be that way. Oh well. There's also a few too many \"hidden behind fake tile\" secrets, but they still aren't that prevalent and most of them have some indication. \n\nOther than that? A lot to love. I really can't explain why it's great without spoiling puzzle solutions or the quirks of the mechanics, but it's well worth your time to play. Definitely would recommend, but it's not for everyone, that's for sure.\n- [b][i]AMID EVIL[/i] is very much [i]Quake[/i] 1 level design in a [i]Hexen[/i]/[i]Heretic[/i] universe.[/b] It's well done. We're a bit spoiled this year with outstanding '90s FPS shooters. Personally, I prefer both [i]Ion Maiden[/i] and [i]DUSK[/i] over this title for the following reasons:\n\n1) I find [i]AMID EVIL[/i] to be a bit generic in terms of theme; the fantasy setting could use a bit more to set it apart.\n\n2) I prefer real or low fantasy weapons/guns over wands and totally high fantasy weapons. Now, don't get it twisted - I appreciate that these high fantasy weapons exist, but yeah, they leave something to be desired. I miss reloading and all of that. \n\n3) The level design in [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is much more 'sprawling' (for lack of a better term) just like the original [i]Quake[/i]. Most levels are indoors in what feels like an underground compound (at the time of writing this review). I personally like the backwoods feel of [i]DUSK[/i], or the dystopian cityscape of [i]Ion Maiden[/i] far more. I want to look up at the sky in most levels.\n\n4) The enemy design is different than the other two games I mention, which is good - but they all mostly have a 'same' kind of feel. The enemies are all super fast, so most of your efforts are focused on running backwards while fending them off. It's fun, but gunplay isn't quite as fun as the other two games for this particular reason.\n\n5) The font and overall menu system definitely feels 'Early Access'. I know the font is being worked on, which is desperately needed. \n\n6) My favorite way to play the game is Endless mode - and I feel like that's a flaw in itself. It's the opposite for me with [i]DUSK[/i]. I want to fall in love with the campaign, but eh, there isn't really any story or anything all that interesting to suck me in. The secrets are super easy to find compared to the other two games, too.\n\n7) No multiplayer. Now, I really don't care about this - but who designs a game in this genre without building this in from the ground up? You know the community is going to whine about this. Questionable design decision to say the least.\n\n[b]Well, it sounds like I just dumped all over the game.[/b] Please don't get me wrong. [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is a welcome addition to the genre. The *great news* is that this is not just some reskin of [i]DUSK[/i] - it certainly is it's own thing. And that's really important. \n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+Fairly polished game for Early Access\n+It's the most modern version of the original [i]Quake[/i] we've seen this year\n+Well optimized\n+Lots of content right now\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-The universe is generic\n-No multiplayer\n-The font is too hard to read\n-Music is nothing to write home about\n-The secrets are easy, and there really aren't all that many of them\n-Weapons could use more 'oomph' to them; also we should be able to use the special ability when we want to as opposed to it autotriggering\n\n[b]I was psyched out of my mind for [i]AMID EVIL[/i] - and while it is certainly good - I think I'll be focused more on [i]DUSK[/i] and [i]Ion Maiden[/i].[/b] Because, let's face it, gaming time is valuable and we can't play everything.\n- SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT.\n\nAs the store page states, NOREN is supposedly a 'simple' keyfinding game. That would be true if there were any keys actually in the game, but as it stands it seems that NOREN is a simple abandoned shovelware game that's impossible to progress in, let alone beat. You play as some soldier in a massive, dark castle, equipped only with a dying lantern. The light fades quickly, and you can regain light slowly by... standing by a light source. That'd be simple enough if you weren't endlessly pursued by dinosaurs that are programmed with AI which knows your exact location at all times; three chomps and you're 'aparted' from the world, where you respawn with whatever amount of light and sanity you have left. Additionally, the translation attempt is abysmal at best. \n\nBoth NOREN and its developer, ThroneLab, should be banned from Steam. I do not blow the 'scam' whistle lightly, and I only do such when I am 100% certain of something actually being a scam. There are a handful of videos of this title on YouTube as well, with only one being over 5 minutes long. No one found a key. If evidence can be presented to me that there is in fact a way to progress in this game, I will rewrite this review. Until then, beware and stay vigilant.\n\n[h1]Rating: [b]0.0/5.0[/b] - WARNING.

There's a lot of useful lessons anyone can pick up from this.\n\nThe emotional issues it tackles are pretty grounded and somewhat refreshing to see in a game. There's a HUGE mystery element when it comes to the story. (which is sooo damn good mind you). But the conversations you have with the people in this game are just so real and cherishable, you could just wish these in-game days won't stop. \n\nThe small moments you have with family and friends in Night in the Woods are probably one of the most amazing experiences I ever had in a game\n\nPS: After finishing the story, I got all sappy and tear jerky that I went and called my mom to tell her that I love and miss her and stuff.. that's what this game is.\n\nUgh kill me. Im so corny. I love this feeling. So refreshing. f*ck off all of you.\n- This game is set to release in early October, but I definitely wouldn't buy it anytime soon. It's not ready. It's full of weird little errors, the mechanics and UI are clunky as hell, there's a lot of information you really need but don't get, the \"events\" are incredibly repetitive, half the time the wording is so bad you're left confused what's actually happening, even the basics aren't there- random capitalization, no consistency from panel to panel or objective to objective... This game needs another 6 months in EA.\n- very fun there is lots to do \nit runs well\nglitches are very funny\nable to download community made maps and mutators from workshop\ncan unlock different mutators as you play\nyour a goat\nyou do goat things\nyou can do non goat thing such as being a shopping cart or a microwave\nyou can also be a goat\n**Spoiler**\n[spoiler] Im a goat [/spoiler]\n\n GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!GOATS!\n- This game is so good! I actually teared up with some of the conversations (Nightgaunt and Riptide anyone??) and I definitely wasn't expecting that. All of the dialogue is super natural and the relationship's progress really cute. I honestly can't believe this game is free\n- [h1]A Great Time [i]Killer[/i][/h1]\n\nSlayaway Camp is an enjoyable puzzle game that runs great and is well polished.  It's intellectually stimulating, humorous, and fun with just a sprinkle of nostalgia.  \n\nThe difficulty curve is perfect.

In fact, I've loved it since I was in highschool about 8 years ago. My friend and I used to play this game together all the time on my flashdrive. We were always discussing & trying to understand the ins-&-outs of the game and how to get a specific ending depending on what you did. Playing this brought me back to those good times in that library.\n\nThe OSTs are nostalgic, the gameplay is about the same and the artwork is amazing as ever(actually the graphics are much better with this remake).\nThe only complaint I have is that it lags at random times(though usually in the menu). The original IB on RPGMaker never did that.\nOverall I'm glad I bought this so I could support the Dev and thank them for all those years of entertainment-\nI just wish there wasn't so much lag over an RPGMaker game.\n- Remember when Doom 2016 released the multiplayer beta test first, and we rightfully worried the game would be a flop? Thankfully, the campaign instead blew us away.\n\nI enjoyed my first run through 2016, but only moderately so. In the original Dooms, if you never stop moving, enemies truly can never hit you. With 2016, however, enemies lead their shots if you move predictably. Also, if you leave line of sight, the demons will fire several more predict shots, in case you re-engage from the same vantage point.\n\nI failed to adapt initially. Instead, I blamed the game, claiming it felt unfair compared to the originals.\n\nThen, I stumbled upon Clockner's playthrough of Doom. He showed me a skill ceiling I never dreamed possible. Next came ByteMe's speedrun performance at QuakeCon 2019. I noticed when the demons charged their shots, he would at times hold still and bait for them to aim before dodging at the last second.\n\nThe excuses were off. Doom has transformed after 25 years. The enemies are now more intelligent (yet not overly so). I too needed to evolve.\n\nAs I took on my Ultra Nightmare run (over 3-4 months), I developed a deep knowledge of every level, and in the process, became fond of every inch, as if the entire UAC and Hell were my homes. UN felt like such an accomplishment. After that, I tried to take on an all runes/weapons/challenges mastered run (no grinding). I failed the first two times. With Eternal around a day or two away, I just completed this challenge on my third try. Personally, I leave satisfied with nothing left.\n\nI initially had gripes with 2016, only to learn the developers were one step ahead. When a team/game proves me wrong, I am loyal forever.\n\nDoom 2016 will now be uninstalled from my machine, never again to be reinstalled. May your thirst for blood never quench. And may we never need you again.\n\nTo me, Doom 2016 is also Eternal 🙏.\n- If Hayao Miyazaki directed a video game I feel like it'd be something like Owlboy. By which I mean; stunning visuals, incredible soundtrack and a wonderful story. The three intertwine so well that I'd consider it to be my Ocarina of Time for Pixel Platformers.\nAnd an indie game that's so damn beautiful it made me write my first review.\n- Know your History: \n\nMany of you will already know this, but this game has ties much deeper than you think. It's no secret that Bethesda's Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim had extended it's life through an extensive modding community. For decades, literally, ENBs, shaders, textures, companions, and even story-lines added THOUSANDS of hours to an already sizable game. One story-line mod was called \"The Forgotten City\".  Over the next few years since it's release, the mod had acquired awards such as the 2016 Australian Writers' Guild Award, Zero Period Top 5 Quest Mods of 2015, and others. It was an astounding mod that threw the dragon born into a deeply profound, well written, and engaging story. It was a staple for my personal mod list for years. I've played the Skyrim version countless times, but as soon as I saw this release I immediately bought this and booted it up. \nObviously this is nothing like the mod, both visually or engine wise, but the spirit of the game is still there. It's more defined, expanded, and developed. It deserves every award and accolade it's received. When I walked into the opening scene and fell down the tunnel I couldn't help but shake my head and smile as a wave of nostalgia mixed with new expectations flooded my mind:\n\n\"My god, they've done it.\" \n\nHere's to you, Modern Storyteller, all the best and more to come!\n- [h1]A game meant to bring back memories that is similar to Super Mario World on the SNES and it does this with relatively few gameplay and gimmick elements.

After all, it has to be ready for take-off in order for children everywhere to receive their presents on schedule. But a wicked troll blasts us out of the sky just as the test drive is about to end. He went over the line and wants to ruin Christmas for everyone on Earth. It is up to us to bring the troll to his senses and save Christmas for everyone.\n\nTLoS brings players to one world and six levels of great platforming that are reminiscent of Super Mario World (SNES) but simplified. There are only six levels total, one of which is a castle, before the final battle with the troll. The only difference is that we will be collecting chocolate cookies rather than the traditional yellow coins. We also lose part of our cloak when we are injured, so it's not uncommon for you to find yourself jumping through the levels wearing nothing but red boxer shorts. For instance, red blocks can give you a new coat, which means extra life, or Santa socks and hats, which give a power-up or simply chocolate cookies. The power-up allows you to throw stones as if you had collected the Fire Flower from Super Mario, and that's about it. TLoS also offers a 2-4 co-op player mode, in which players will be able to work together to complete this short and family-friendly adventure.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3009359595\n\nSimilar to Super Mario World, you walk to a level to choose them in the Overworld. Once we reach a certain level, we are allowed to walk, leap, and even sprint. Additionally, there are other indications on the screen that show you how many cookies you have already gathered and how much time is remaining to finish the level. We get an extra life when 100 cookies are collected. We can activate a checkpoint about halfway through the level to pick up exactly where the checkpoint was reached, instead of having to do the entire level all over again. The game also features side-scrolling and underwater levels. The only problem is that if you quit at level three, close the game and start again, you have to start from level one, so you have to play the game in one go. This means that there are no save points or \"save states\". Considering the length of the game, this is not a big deal, but it's still \"annoying\".\n\n[h3] My Specs [/h3]\n\n[code]CPU: i9 9900k\nGPU: RTX 2080 Ti\nRAM: DDR4 32 GB RAM\nOS: Win10\nResolution: 1440p @144hz\n[/code]\n\n[h3] Conclusion [/h3]\n\nWe are all hoping that Nintendo will release their IPs on Steam so that we can play with them one more time. We may all agree, based on experience, that this is probably never going to happen, but Indie developers are there to make it happen. To avoid the tedious teachings at school, you used to be able to play these types of games in class on the usual Flash Player websites, and now you can play them on Steam. Though it's not a masterpiece, it's extremely minimalistic, and it's unquestionably too short, the 20 minutes I spent playing it were nevertheless a lot of fun, especially because the platforming is accurate and not wonky at all. Just remember, it's very minimalistic and may be too minimalistic for some, but if that doesn't bother you, feel free to go ahead and try it out.\n\nIt would be my personal highlight if there were additional levels, more secret exits, more power-up alternatives, and more hours of overall playtime.\n\n[h2] Final Verdict: 8/10 A typical gas station snack that turns out to be a surprisingly good one.🎅 [/h2]\n- oh good god how do i remove things from my library\n- Do you kinda like 4X games, but mostly the first 2-3 hours of the game where you're exploring and hacking a basic civilization out of the wilderness and desperately fending off natural threats while trying to keep people fed and productive? If so, this game is for you. Nice tight gameplay loop where things never get stagnant for too long; always novel threats and opportunities, and you're not tied to any one settlement for very long, so victory and defeat alike are more temporary. Not to mention a really astounding amount of fun, polished content for an early access game! Eremite, Hooded Horse, I salute you.\n- I reviewed the original Mark of the Ninja more than 4 years ago. I liked its stealth-based gameplay approach and praised the learning curve experienced throughout the story. I bought the [i]Special Edition[/i] which practically meant an add-on with some more levels, a custom and the option to replay the entire game in commentary mode. \n\nYou know some games get re-released due to the availability of a new console generation. This [i]Remastered[/i] edition is what was made available for PS4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch users not long ago. We, PC gamers (who already own the original Mark of the Ninja), can get this version free-of-charge in our library.\n\nThere's not much to say, really. I do not have a 4K display so this higher resolution I cannot enjoy. Compressed in-game art or not the original already looked very good. But the creators confirmed this will give us an enhanced experience even under 1080p resolution. \n\nWell, I did complete the game once again as this is how much I love MoN. I recommend that you do the same.\n\nPS: It may be possible that you are required to have the special edition of the original version to get the remastered version.\n- I waited 12+ years for a proper sequel to A Crack in Time (yes i know the other games came out but tbh they didn't do much for me) for it only to come out for the PS5. Unfortunately, I wasn't getting a new console for just one game. \n\nNow, two years later I'm playing it on the PC.  While surreal, I am super glad they ported this series to a different platform, and the game was totally worth the wait.\n\nThe port by Nixxes ran very nice for me. I had a few hitches in the dimensional portal scenes, and one crash in a total of 12hrs of playtime. I do understand that some people are having issues and that does suck & does not disqualify their experiences, however, It is not even close to how bad TLOU Pt.1's port was.  \n\nIt's another Insomniac banger, and if you've played any of their games you already know whats up. I beat the game in 12 hrs on the 2nd to last difficulty grabbing whatever side content/collectibles I could before the story captivated me. As is tradition, there is a NG+ mode (haven't touched yet) and I look forward to trying it. I'll probably update the review at that point, but the games are always repayable due to their collect-a-thon nature, that and being so damn fun you have a dumb ear-to-ear smile for all of the playtime.  \n \nIf you enjoyed the Ratchet and Clank games in the past, its way more of that + the dimensional gimmick which is really well done and very neat tech wise. I love the new movement features and Rivet is a very good addition to the cast. I hope she stays relevant in the story in the future. Game feels super good to play as well, weapons are great as always. The writing is still funny and enjoyable. It's just a good time, and I highly recommend it, even at full price.\n\nLastly, I would like to direct a message to Sony/PS Studios/Insomniac Games:\nPLEASE PORT THE OTHER AND OLDER R&C GAMES PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE IPELASE PLs I WILL PAY $70\n- Very calm game with heartwarming moments. Better played with friends. Really brilliant gameplay idea. I just hope it gets a final ending really soon!\n\nEdit: After reaching the ultimate end, I felt bit disappointed. The progress was just straight up boring and uninteresting after years of restarting again and again.\nVery fun game anyways\n- From my nine year old: \"We like that every screen you can stop and color, and if you don't want to color there is a story part to it. We really like to do both; there are puzzles, different colors and different sections. I would definitely recommend this game for five and up year olds.\"\n- While still a work very much in progress, Nuclear Throne is currently one of my favorite games. It's a roguelike dungeon crawler with heavy \"bullet-hell\" elements and a little RPG sprinkled on top. When you begin a session of Nuclear Throne, you choose from one of several well-designed & freakish \"mutants\", each with their own special attributes which, in itself, does much to add variety (there's also a random-select option which is a fun idea in this particular case). The goal of each stage is to exterminate all of the enemies. After doing so, a portal opens which takes your mutant freak to the next level. There are a great many weapons with which to inflict meyhem on your adversaries. As you gain experience points, in the form of green goo earned by killing enemies & also found in cache jars, you'll be able to choose new persistent perks for your character (such as more HP or certain weapons doing more damage). Every so-often, you'll encounter a boss. The bosses tend to pop in during the height of an already-in-progress battle which makes beating them all-the-more difficult & hectic.\n\nOriginally, this game did not have controller support which was a great disappointment (though I had been ejoying it anyway, using the keyboard and mouse). However, a recent update rectified this and the gameplay using a dual-analog controller (such as that of the Xbox 360) is just fantastic. Like Ultratron before it (another very similar game which is also worth a look; I also wrote a review for it, if you're interested in checking it out), Nuclear Throne throws you straight back to the arcades of yore and plops you in front of a Smash TV cabinet.\n\nAs a roguelike dungeon-crawler, the replay value is extremely high (due to the fact that the level and enemy layout is totally different from one session to the next). The rather extreme difficulty doesn't hurt either, as playing entails dying and thus restarting... a lot. Fortunately, said difficulty isn't of the variety that compels you to smash your controller/keyboard in frustration. Every death feels like the fault lay squarely on *your* shoulders (if only you had moved to dodge a little faster or conserved ammo a little better!), as opposed to the game feeling like it's cheating. Another stand-out feature which I think I need to bring up is the soundtrack. ...Just wow! Nuclear Throne's score is totally original and extremely surreal. It goes *miles* in lending its own atmosphere to the game. \n\nSome might consider the current price of $12.99 to be just a *little* steep for a game in this class, but considering how well it's made overall and the fun I've gotten from it (especially being in its currently pre-release/beta state), I consider it to be well worth the price. As of the time of this writing, the developer(s) is very active and updates are coming quite frequently.\n\nUPDATE 01/12/16: I hadn't played this game in quite a while (at least 6+ months) and I wanted to check out the progress that the devs have made, etc. Well... The game starts but as soon as I select a character, it totally locks up. I can't play it at all. To make matters worse, I've heard that the devs have since \"abandoned\" development of this game (so it's not likely that whatever is causing the crashes for me is going to be fixed any time soon - or ever). Bummer man. I loved this game...\n- I am a day one player who quit the game within a few days. After coming back after almost 2 years, I am shocked and surprised. The overall improvement is great, quests are not bothering you. Story and atmosphere is hooking you up and the overall experience is good. Leveling up is easy and also you are not struggling as in most MMOs.\n\nDespite the past of the game, I think it is worth trying.\n- This game is set to release in early October, but I definitely wouldn't buy it anytime soon. It's not ready. It's full of weird little errors, the mechanics and UI are clunky as hell, there's a lot of information you really need but don't get, the \"events\" are incredibly repetitive, half the time the wording is so bad you're left confused what's actually happening, even the basics aren't there- random capitalization, no consistency from panel to panel or objective to objective... This game needs another 6 months in EA.\n- [h1]The Good[/h1]\n- Cop System.\n- Best progression in a need for speed game in years.\n- Genuinely fun and engaging, builds on the foundation of nfs2015 while taking the good mechanics from payback to make a compelling game. If the need for speed hype was still around people would stop asking for most wanted again because want it or not this is it, even if it falls short on a few cases.\n- Feel of \"speed\".\n- Insanely beautiful, runs super well, amazing lighting. Looks good on both day and night.\n- Day and night have different purposes in the game, and the fact you can choose is pretty cool as well. You can sweat if you want or if you want just races you can stay in the day.\n- Visual customization with community decals, let's go!\n- Online entirely optional, is kind of the same as nfs2015 instead of payback having the singleplayer map but instead allowing free roam drivers which is pretty cool\n- Car profiles like we have in forza, no more taking a racing car into the offroad! They actually perform as they should!\n- Good map\n- Crossplay\n- Character customization\n\n[h1]The Bad[/h1]\n- Cop System. It has a lot of rough edges that will piss you off. Yes it's the difficulty players wanted but also too much rubberbanding, \"rhino incoming\" taking half your screen not actually letting you see the rhino, game basically requiring you to abuse ramps because there's no proper way to actually deal with cops, etc.\n- Story is short and shitty. Payback as mid as it was did the \"corrupt cop\" storyline better\n- Progression system is taken back by the included powerful starter cars which came from the deluxe edition. It's fine since it's included but I hate how good features are destroyed with certain executive decisions\n- No post-release support, as it's the case with EA games\n- Need origin to play\n- Lots of bugs\n\n[h1]Neutral[/h1]\n- Overall teenager aesthetic. I like the neon style, but the overall teenager stuff and spanish characters (which are here because of the la casa de papel trend) just don't click with me. I just cringe all over the marketing material and how the characters engage\n- 21:9 support is fine not considering the map which doesn't scale to 21:9 unfortunately\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nThis is it boys. Need for speed is back!\n- I'm gonna be talking about the game in very broad strokes so don't worry about spoilers. \n\nI'm bananas about the Dead Space series. The experience of playing the original in 2009 or so left a massive impression on me and I think this is overall a pretty fantastic update. I've played the original [strike] trilogy [/strike] duology to death on every system, listened to stuff, looked at stuff, everything. So as someone who has Nicole's monologue burnt into the back of my eyelids, I was pretty sceptical Motive would be able to win me over with Dead Space 23. I was very pleasantly surprised, though. It's clear a lot of love and care went into refining Dead Space for the remake and in many ways I find these refinements make the setting, characters, and mysteries all a lot more compelling. \n\nOn the lead up to release there was an IGN series of short interviews with developers, artists, writers, etc working on the remake. It was really fascinating hearing about how they were approaching different aspects of the project, there's a lot of interesting insights about the aesthetic and thematic goals of the game in there that get me really craving a Dead Space 23 art book. If you're sceptical about Dead Space 23, I think they're worth a watch. It's really striking how thoughtful they've been in creating their take on Dead Space and I don't think their efforts deserve to go so easily overlooked. If you're really interested in the artistry of the series I'd also highly recommend The Art of Dead Space, it's a great book and an amazing collection of art that really lays bare the core identity of the series. It's been a great companion piece to Dead Space 23.  I think a lot of people have been comparing the choices and artistic aims of the original team and the new devs in bad faith, I really can't see anything but reverence for the source material here. I'd also say that the differences that are there are interesting and well worth exploring!\n\nI'm also glad Dead Space has room to breathe again, EA really pushed the extended universe the first time around and I'm glad to see that mistake hasn't been repeated. I'm not someone who's super into lore, I like finding extra information that re-contextualises things in cool ways but this extended universe stuff can get pretty silly. There were animated movies, books, tie-in games, a Wii rail shooter (which I enjoyed) and most of it just served to undermine the setting and the horror for me. That isn't to say the remake shies away from its roots because it absolutely doesn't, there's an entire New Game+ path that I think incorporates a direct reference to one of the extended universe novels. If you're a lorehead you'll definitely recognise familiar names in text logs, even very forgettable characters get some mentions in. I really love this about the remake, it reincorporates a lot of this disparate stuff into more of a coherent whole. \n\nI think my favourite addition is the AI director that manages encounters and atmospheric effects. Dead Space is a game that invokes hypervigilance, I think that's part of what makes the series so compelling. You're always alert, always listening and watching, always looking over your shoulder. It has an intensity that I feel is absolutely unmatched. With the AI director in the mix that feeling is sharper than ever. You can't rely on memory alone to get you through now. Yeah, you can still memorise spawns and there are still an abundance of scripted encounters but you can never safely bet you know what's coming and when. Sometimes the lights will flicker and steam will hiss from the pipes- nothing. But sometimes a pregnant and most of a divider will be waiting for you right by the shop. You can truly never assume you're safe, that feeling is no longer illusory as it was in Dead Space 2008. I think that's great. I also found that the director would spawn interesting combinations of enemy types which is cool, it went a long way to making the threat more unpredictable. \n\nI never really experienced any of the performance issues everyone else is talking about so I think my main issue with the game is very petty. I flat out do not like the redesign of the Soldier rig. They look like those guys who're really into Mandalorian themed tactical gear and Punisher stuff. So, yeah, not sure if that's an intentional update to reflect reality but, aesthetically speaking, I found it very jarring. \n\nI think this is a very solid foundation to build on to bring back the Dead Space series. I hope in the future there might be more challenge modes, higher difficulties, more unlockable suits. Most of all though I hope Motive, like their predecessors, take some pointers from the Resident Evil games. I'm a big fan of the records system in the recent Resident Evil titles. It contributes enormously to replayability and it's neat getting to examine all the models, animations, concept art, all the good stuff. As someone who likes crafts and fan projects, something like that would be indispensable. it's all work that very much deserves to be admired, too. Some of the detail on the necromorphs is ludicrous. A records system would also be a great excuse to do wild runs like beating the game without healing or opening the shop. Just give me a reason, Motive.\n\nThere are thousands of things about this remake that I could just keep gushing about. Maybe I'll update this review over time and do just that (I have). But I hope for now this review has gone some way to convincing you to try out Dead Space. \n\nTanya Clarke killed it as Nicole, too.\n- A simple but detailed explanation of why, after having played both versions, I prefer Definitive Edition (DE) instead of 2013 Edition:\n\n-2013 Edition's farms don't automatically re-seed, forcing you to either order your villagers to re-seed them, or to mash the \"queue re-seed\" button in the mill. In DE, you can set the mills to automatically re-seed.\n-Definitive Edition lets you shift-click construction orders just like in 2013 Edition, but in the latter, the villager will move to build the last building you placed down. If you order several buildings, they will stop constructing the building they're already working on to go build the new one. In DE they will wait to finish the first building before starting on the next one.\n-2013 Edition's unit sprites are very pixelly and hard to distinguish one type of infantry unit from another, and to a lesser extent, one team from another. DE's graphics are much clearer so it is very easy to distinguish unit type/team.\n-Definitive Edition is far, FAR more customizable than 2013 Edition. Not just with the settings (graphics, UI, and controls are much more changeable) but especially with creating a game, namely win conditions, starting conditions, map sizes, unit restrictions, etc. You can adjust many more settings to make a new game into whatever kind of scenario you want. Also you can see what the map types actually look like in DE.\n-Definitive Edition has noticeably better pathfinding than 2013 Edition.\n-In DE you can zoom in and out. In 2013 Edition you can't.\n-In DE you can queue build orders while simultaneously upgrading the building. In 2013 Edition you can't even see any build options while a building is in the middle of upgrading.\n-In DE you can tell scouts to automatically scout out the map.\n-In DE the HUD shows you how many villagers are working on each resource. 2013 Edition does not do this, you have to play hide and seek with each one to count them.\n-The soundtrack for DE has more faction-specific songs, as well as less repetitive music. Both game's soundtracks are good, but I find having the DE soundtrack playing in the background to be more enjoyable. This point is pure preference.\n-2013 Edition's graphics are nice if you enjoy the old-school style, but DE's graphics are significantly easier on the eyes and prettier.\n-Definitive Edition has more civilizations.\n-Definitive Edition is just as moddable and has a very passionate modding community.\n-Definitive Edition seems to have more balanced gameplay.\n- [I received this product for free from a giveaway]. Only played for a short time, but sheesh, it's a bit of a mess both visually and gameplay wise. There's not much I can really say that would differ from what's shown in the trailer (rather crude MS-paint looking drawings with a few short looping backgrounds). You jump when moving right or left, flappy-bird esque, you dodge stuff going across the screen and from the top, which is a bit boring to me, but some may enjoy it more. You also have to go out of the screen to dodge sometimes, but also if you go too far out (who knows how far) you'll die as well. It might be an okay time waster for free (like old flash games), but I wouldn't recommend spending your money on this.\n- I have always wanted to play Resdient Evil 4, and I wanted to play this game so badly.  I am giving a negative review simply because the games FPS on the PC are bad, that could be because of Windows 10 because I heared rumors that the game does not run well on it and such, so that could be the problem.   Another problem I faced is the lip sync is dealyed when it's on the cutscenes so that makes everything slow and such.  The gameplay from what I seen however is pretty great and I think Resdient Evil 4 is a great game, but this port is not, get it for the GC, Will, PS2, or any of the consloes that has this game.\n- I appreciate the sincerity of Jusant. You can tell its creators have placed genuine care into their product, which has made the experience of playing it joyful and kind.\nThe visuals are stunning, the mechanics are not overwhelming, the soundtrack is soothing, and the puzzles are not frustrating. A great climbing game all around with an easy-to-follow yet gripping narrative. \nHopefully, Ukrainian localization will also be added soon.\n\n- SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT. SCAM ALERT.\n\nAs the store page states, NOREN is supposedly a 'simple' keyfinding game. That would be true if there were any keys actually in the game, but as it stands it seems that NOREN is a simple abandoned shovelware game that's impossible to progress in, let alone beat. You play as some soldier in a massive, dark castle, equipped only with a dying lantern. The light fades quickly, and you can regain light slowly by... standing by a light source. That'd be simple enough if you weren't endlessly pursued by dinosaurs that are programmed with AI which knows your exact location at all times; three chomps and you're 'aparted' from the world, where you respawn with whatever amount of light and sanity you have left. Additionally, the translation attempt is abysmal at best. \n\nBoth NOREN and its developer, ThroneLab, should be banned from Steam. I do not blow the 'scam' whistle lightly, and I only do such when I am 100% certain of something actually being a scam. There are a handful of videos of this title on YouTube as well, with only one being over 5 minutes long. No one found a key. If evidence can be presented to me that there is in fact a way to progress in this game, I will rewrite this review. Until then, beware and stay vigilant.\n\n[h1]Rating: [b]0.0/5.0[/b] - WARNING. Scam developer. Abandon all hope, ye who enter.[/h1]\nThe Horror Network [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28221963/]Curator[/url] | [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thehorrornetwork]Group[/url] Click for Gore\n- I would give this a mixed rating if I could. \nThe story is told in such a boring way that it's hard to stay invested. You run to one person, listen to a cutscene, or more likely read a cutscene, than go to another person to talk to. Sometimes you fight one guy but mostly it's pretty dull. There is very little gameplay in the overland content and everything plays like a bad visual novel.\n\nAAR, the first MSQ is just one fetch quest after the other with little story in it. Oh there is some story there, but it's not great. The characters are shallow with few expectations, both the supporting cast and villains. \n\nHeavensward, the expansion I got through before my time ran out, is better than ARR but not that enjoyable. There were parts I like (not to give spoilers, it was the part where you go on a “journey”) Sadly, that part of the expansion was far too short. Than the story precedes to shove itself up it’s own ass as it becomes fixated on one part of the lore. [spoiler]I don’t give a damn how the war started! It was a thousand years ago.[/spoiler]\nPro:\n-If you like story, and only story, you will like this game.\n-A lot of content\n-Trial fights. (Good boss fights without the boring part of dungeons)\n\nCons:\n-Little in the way of gameplay outside of dungeons and trials \n-ARR is a slog and not worth reading. Skip as fast as you can and just watch a recap video.\n-dungeons are locked behind the story and not unlocked as you level up.\n-The story is on the lower end of other final fantasy games.\n-Lalafells are in the game. People who play this race are degenerates.\n- And that's it, after 278 hours of play, the adventure is over... \nThis type of game that you wish you could forget so you could rediscover it like the 1st time, where you discover everything, a bit like a child\nIt's a game made with passion for video games, to tell a story, to make the player laugh too, and to make him a little melancholic or horrified or even sickened sometimes\n\n[u]Divinity OS 2 will have marked my young adult life[/u], like Sonic and megadrive games, Pokémon, FFTactics, Zelda and gameboy / gamecube games, Warcraft3 (TT), or Mass Effect and other PC games did in my childhood and adolescence (I surely forget so much excellent games)\n\nIt's a 20/20 for me. The work is titanic. The game is really made with passion. The studio is very talented.\n\nSo when Steam asks me [i]\"Do you recommend this game\"[/i], I say:\nYes! Because this is where you feel that video games are an experience, an adventure to live! \nI went through Rivellion with my buddy, like I went through Kanto (Pokémon), or Ivalice in FF Tactics as a kid!\n\n\n[u][b]Atmosphere:[/b][/u]\nMany of us probably remember our adventures in Pokémon or other games in our childhood. We roamed, discovered and lived in these worlds!\n\nHere, it's the same thing, and not alone this time: I was with a very good friend! \nWe met frequently to venture into the world of Divinity as a lightning lizard warrior or a skeletal assassin with a mysterious past...\n\nWith our companions Lohse and Ifan, and Maladie, and Gareth, and Jahan and Han the survivor kid and Sir Lora and so many others. Impossible to forget... \n[i]They exist! Stop lying, I know they exist ![/i]\n\nOur choices were important: We decided to do justice to this or that person, provoking reactions (or death) in certain characters, slapping a few Magisters around when necessary\nAnd of course, we STRONGLY decided to stea... Borrow a lot of spells and equipments from the merchants, while the other one was distracting by chatting...\n... What? We didn't have the money and we had to save the world ! Well, we had the money, but you never know, maybe one day we will need it... !\nAnd then stealing, it's fun. And exhilarating hehehe\n\n\n[u][b]Gameplay:[/b][/u]\nA 3D tactical turn-based game, to play with friends. Really ! Don't play this game alone, I'm sure that with at least 1 buddy (or 3!), you will exploit the game to its full potential!\n\nAlso, [u]you can change your skills and class at any moment in the game[/u], it's very flexible ! I played rogue all my game, and in the last chapiter, I decided to play with spear and War skills ! I really enjoyed being able to switch like this, as I want ! The game want you to take FUN, not \"suffering\" your \"bad\" class choices !\n\nToo bad, I don't know anyone who is ready to take on the role of a GM (Game Master), to live a personalized campaign! Because it is a mode apart from the main campaign!\n\n\n[u][b]Music:[/b][/u]\nExtremely good and fits perfectly with the atmosphere of the game. This kind of OST that we listen to when we work and that makes us live our adventures again when the song becomes EPIC!\n\n\n[u][b]In summary:[/b][/u]\nTitanic content, assured re-playability for those who wish to know what would have happened if they had answered something else than \"FIIIIIIIIIIIIGHT\", and I repeat, the fact of being able to play with friends makes the game so much more pleasant to do!\n\n\n[b]*Sob*[/b]\nBut no, I'm not crying... I'm just allergic to emotions!\n\nI would like so much to forget this game to be able to rediscover it\n\nPlease play it, at least give it a try, and let yourself be immersed in Div's world!\n\nIn our case, we will do it again in HARDCORE mode !\n\nPeace guys !\n- Volition ups the silly, and adds super powers, but loses a little something along the way.\n\nI loved Saint's Row: the Third, and by all rights should have loved IV as well, but I mostly just liked it. The set up was fun, and seemed to up the ante again, but then you get the presidency ripped away from you almost immediately (without even seeing the consequences of your first pushed legislation!). Placing the game in a virtual city for the most part with the only real characters being on your space ship, really kinda seemed to gut the game. Even when [spoiler]the world gets destroyed[/spoiler], a detached, \"meh\" was all I could muster. The humor is there, but it's mostly better in the DLC. The radio stations feel kind of underwhelming without DJs.\n\nFinally all the fun of collecting and customizing various interesting cars, and finding ways to climb or fall to interesting places with a stolen plane/parachute are gutted with the inclusion of super powers. Also, the super powers make gunplay, leveling any of your other stuff, and pretty much every mechanic carried over from Saints Row: the Third obsolete.\n\nIf you get this game, do yourself a favor and make sure you get all the DLC where most of the real fun is. Is it as good as the previous Saints Row? I don't think so, but I still recommend getting it and playing through it. It is a lot of fun, and I love the 50's break out scenario at the beginning.\n\nStacey's thoughts:\nStill awaiting DLC with Jane Austin and the D*ldo Bat. Can somebody make this, for, uhh, scientific purposes.\n- Micromanage your 90%+ minority space colony simulator 2017\n\nSeriously, when choosing my starting colonists I had to reroll 15-20 times per colonist to get a white male colonist. It's almost like this game was made for Swedens' liberal party or something\n\n0/10 for feminista multi-kulti propaganda\n- This game is like cocaine. \nI always tell myself just one more, then im done. I'll do homework. I'll sleep. I'll eat something. \nBut you know what? That last death was cheap, I'll do one more to make up for it. I just need 1000 gold for that upgrade, I'll just do one more to get it. Always just one more. \n\nThings I like:\n\n+Strong RPG Progression - Gold from your run can be spent on stats, equipment, abilities, etc. making multiple runs and longer runs more rewarding.\n\n+The game is witty and has flavor. -- there are various conditions your new characters can have such as being blind, gay or having a fear of chickens, amongst many, many others. Dying is in this sense, pretty fun. The writing has a lot of charm!\n\n+The controls are very tight -- this game has good controls. It's easy to do what you want, which is good because it's very tough and you will die a lot.\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n- The bosses in new game plus don't get harder -- As you progress into new game + or ++ or +++ and beyond, the bosses don't scale well, despite the general enemies leveling up to basically become bosses themselves. Not a huge deal, but it's the only negative I have.\n\nThen at some point you realize you've beaten the game, Thankfully there is a new game plus.\nMaybe just one more playthrough...\n- Black Mesa is a fantastic remake of the Original Valve classic and one of the greatest of all time video games, Half-Life.  This sci-fi classic FPS has you take on what might seem like a hum-drum day in the life of an experimental physicist, but things go quite off rails when experimenting with a strange material sample from an even stranger dude in a suit. \n\nAfter a while (and shooting a lot of aliens and bashing their heads in with a crowbar) you'll save the world... but now Black Mesa lets you do this with dramatically updated graphics, 4K support and a plethora of visual tweaks so you can rest assured this will run great on any gaming rig. \n\nA must have for big fans of Half-Life or gamers who are new to the scene and never got to play the original.   When on sale, of course!\n- I remembered when I was 8, back then I used to play this on my PS3. It was one of the first RPG games i've ever played aside from Pokemon on GameBoy / Nintendo DS. This game made me feel like I'm in an another world back then. I had dreams of my companion and Drippy. It was such a nostalgic moment when I opened this game, and I was abit sad because I wished that I could turn back time and finish this game when I was a kid. I wasn't able to finish it at that time due to my brother taking away the PS3 overseas. Because now, after getting older, there are so many responsibilities that I must hold on to. Playing games like this during childhood truly changes the vibe of experiencing it. Now I only got a glimpse of it when I opened it for an hour or so. Maybe one day I'll finish this game, once I'm free from reality.\n- it's a shame but i honestly cannot recommend this game if you are a disabled person, i wasn't that far into the game when my character started panicking apon seeing a disabled person [person with leg braces] and then gets a \"no good answer\" bit of dialog and all the options are saying something wrong or saying nothing, trying to go with the least bad option aside from saying nothing since i know as a disabled person myself [i'm a wheelchair user] it can be pretty upsetting getting people just randomly stare at me and at least when they say something slightly wrong they are engaging with me as a person, my character then proceeds to talk abt what an \"inspiration\" it is 2 c a disabled person living their life,,, not exaggerating when i say i let my head hit the desk, closed the game and uninstalled, i understand that this is probably put in the game to be a teachable moment for the able bodied audience but ironically in trying to educate about us disabled people they then made the assumption that no disabled people would be playing their game as there is no option to make your character disabled or even to make them remotely aware of disability and ended up just making the experience awful for the disabled gamers they seem to be trying to help\n- The game is very good, it's fun and had everything to be a great success, but unfortunately because the anti-piracy, the game doesn't work well, even above 100 fps it feels lag, the game stutters, a strange gameplay.\n\nJust REMOVE DENUVO and the game will have the deserved success.\n\nUnfortunately, they still haven't realized that those who pirate, don't spend money with or without protection, and those who pay like us, have a game with problems.\n\nA good game doesn't need protection to sell, just be good, simple as that.\n- A fun game for drinking parties, take a shot every time you feel like you just wasted 19 cents.\n- owned the original from all the way back in 2014\nloved it tons, even more than RoR2\nsaw RoRR get teased on twitter, was there for its release, thought to myself,\n\"i don't need this, i can just play the ror from 2013, i don't know how to feel about this new one, is it really just the same game again?\"\n\nand then i saw someone grab an item i've never seen before, while playing as a character i've never seen before, on a map layout i've never seen before, using alternate abilities to what was baseline for that character to fight an enemy i've never seen before, and then activate a shrine of the mountain from ror2, and then while doing the teleporter fight they activated a bunch of new machines that turned drones into items and activated a specific equipment for a fee... and then i saw that you can just opt out of whatever you don't like about any of that, at any time!\n\nwhat's not to love about that??\n- This is somehow the only game where you can play as an anti-fascist faction in Nazi Germany, drive the Nazis into the ocean, kill Hitler and reclaim Germany as a democracy, and that's somehow the most boring possible outcome.\n- This game is really special. I'm a 50 year old man with an emotional structure made largely of mud and thumbtacks, and I had to bite the inside of my jaw in a parts to keep from tearing up. \n\nMany people seem to equate an \"adult game\" with gore and violence or explicit imagery. Nothing wrong with those types of games, I have and will continue to enjoy them. This game explores mature themes on relationships and mortality and doesn't pull any punches, without being cheap or manipulative. In that sense, its the most adult game I've ever played. \n\nI won't ever forget it. If this sounds like something you'd be interested in, stop reading and buy it. Its a slow burn, and you won't be invested until you've spent some time with the characters in the story. In the end, the payoff is tremendous.\n- I cannot belive the Q_Q from the negative reviews... so many spoiled little brats or total internet nooobs that do not know any better...... just mind boggling...... beyond words......\n\nGreat game even for early access, spent all my time so far solo on my own PVE solo game, will be playing with my friend(s) later.... a few hit box detection issues, if you load your bow and abort you will have the arrow in your hand no matter what you try and do, even with the axe in your hand the arrow will still be there til death... so just minior little things like that so far... \n\nFantastic graphics, I have everything on ultra and no issues, makes for some really great screenshots.... \n\nNo nudity, partial nudity (topless and loin cloth), and full nudity... tastful nudity as in \"female full nudes are especially lovely and artful\", cannot really say the same for the male character nudes however..... may have seen some.... questionable gifs or images floating around already... so I think that side of thing could have been take care of a bit better than that and made more tasteful since some images are \"questionable\" and quite Porographic... so that will leave a nasty impression of the game for many hopful customers and a stain on the Conan universe....\n\nHad little or no issues with buildings... I built a 3 story houe, last top room was 2 blocks high so do not feel cramped... I built a good long bridge to a big high wide rock, took about 4 pillers and they were about 4-5 blocked high and about 3-4 blocks apart... so good bridges are very possible to keep high and out of danger from NPCs at least and to make good use of tall rocks for base extentions... one issue I have is with stairs, you cannot have a ceiling block and a hole for the starts otherwise you head with get stuck and you cannot pass up the stairs... but you can crouch for a sec and go up the stairs... so a minior bug\n\nSooooo much potential for this game, sooooo many possibilities for this game, the sky is the limit... Devs are on the RIGHT TRACK !!.... I love the total freedom for those that want PvE or those that want PvP, many server configurations to play with to how you like, if you play solo you can even play around with the Admin features and go nuts building amazing buildings, spawn NPCs of all types and numbers.... I love the freedom, many games do not give you this much freedom to play how you want to play and that is how things should be....\n\nGood work Devs.... I was a big Fan of AoC and I was there on the first day and many months, but the combat mechanics in that game got boring fast... this game is simple and I dont think it should get much complex than it is now... so it is a good system\n\n\n- Please please please give this one a try, especially if you're a fan of existentialism, bittersweet stories, cyberpunk dystopias, gambling with your life every day, living life one step at a time, the small things that matter, cats and feeling like sh!t, but in a good way\n- WARNING. This game is pure drug. Don't buy unless You have no kids, no wife and You have a lot free time. I mean thousands of hours.\n\nYour brain will turn into a machine calculating the optimal use of all available resources on the map, there are hundreds of them and each discovery brings new threats from the beautiful mother nature. At some point You may experience unexpected dreams about high tech and well tuned factories.\n\nEarly Access in this case means something similar to never ending story. When You think \"I have done everything\" new update shows up and You're starting doing mess again.\n\nI can only have reservations about the multiplayer mode, where there are funny glitches, disappearing objects, self-propelled vehicles, lack of character synchronization, etc. However, this does not prevent having continuous fun in the co-op mode.\n\nI hope You like it so much as I did.\n\nEDIT: Still thinking of buying it? Don't think, just do it. U8 changed a lot, it's now Unreal Engine 5 with Lumen effects, devs are pushing forward to get final product release. Join the party!\n- As i previously stated, i was going to play through metro fully and i have done so, so here is my update to this review. \nThis game is not the best selling triple A game in the world and it may have some bugs (like a table that wasnt solid or the objects in that room lol) however it is a decent game. the story is decent and the characters voices are way off but they sorta make up for it with their personalities. \n\nExploration in this game is by far one of the most interesting in my opinion and the way your character acts in the enviroment makes it more interesting aswell, for example wiping your visor when it gets dirty (wasnt that helpful for me in my play through but it was a nice touch) and your visor taking damage in combat adds to the immersive feel of this wasteland/paradise almost. Scavenging weapons and parts and combining them to make better equipment is quite intriguing and quick to do if you can find the parts. \n\nat the end of the day my final review of this is its a good game i would play it again even if it is a bit clunky sometimes (atleast it was for me lmao)\n\n\n\n\n\nOh and hopefully my punctuation is good enough so no one passes out this time lmao\n- This game is utter trash, a classic example of a terrible game that exists only to make the developer money on card sales. There are no options for audio and video settings, the textures and font are ugly as hell, and the controls stink. You move a glowing ball of light around and pass through various colored laser barriers. There are enemies who dim your light on the first hit, and kill you on the second. The instructions are barely above gibberish, with instructions like \"color change to spend the wall color\" and \"use the right button mouse for charge and defend\". You eventually piece together that those instructions mean \"touch the colored balls of light to change the color of your light to match the laser barriers in order to pass through them without dying\" and \"stand on the button and right click to power up laser barriers to protect yourself from the small enemy lights that chase you relentlessly when you get too close\". That second one is only theoretical though, as in practice it's impossible to escape the enemy lights fast enough to have time to charge the defensive laser barriers, so I have no proof that they actually destroy the enemies. On top of all that, the game occasionally gets stuck after you die a few times on the same level, and there's nothing to be done except restart from the very beginning on the tutorial levels. There's the potential for an interesting puzzle game here, but the execution is so bad I can't recommend this junk even for the price of two cents that I paid.\n- I was reluctant to buy this because 2020 should be out in a few months but I couldn't pass up the deal I got. I am having a blast with this game! The presentation is wonderful, sense of speed is some of the best I've experienced, and the AI seems very human like so far. I was a little worried about the RPG elements and leveling up because I'm not really into stuff like that but it really isn't that much to worry about and I'm glad I got over myself. I've completed 2 weekends so far with default assists on and I'm currently 10 points behind 1st in the standings. I think it's time to take assists off. Oh I'm using a PS4 controller, by the way. I'll be happy to answer questions if you have any.\n\n***Update because it's super cheap with 2020 coming out soon. I still stand behind my OG review. Early reviews of 2020 indicates that there may be more realistic physics but could still use improvement. I say either get 19 now or wait for 20 to get discounted in a few months. No series is worth $60+ every single year.\n- This is trash, I mean if you eat shit for breakfast I'm sure you'll like it.  You have to pay to have access to graphics better than the PS2's, also your stuff gets deleted every week. All there is to do is punch a couple zombies.  Don't get this game.\n- Ever fire up a game for the first time and within the first twenty or so minutes you know it’s got its hooks sunk into you? Return of the Obra Dinn had that effect on me, and that was only elevated by going into it mostly ignorant as to what the game is. The last thing I was expecting was a game to flex the parts of my brain involving deduction, logic and reasoning; parts I haven’t used since the first Pheonix Wright game. I lost track of how many times I’ve had lightbulb epiphanies or gasped with a sudden realization, a kind of excitement I seldom encounter in gaming. Obra Dinn doesn’t have a time limit, so meandering through the creaky ship at your own pace can be something of a relaxing experience - Though investigating a copious number of murders might shake those relaxed feelings.\n\nI’d classify Return of the Obra Dinn as a nautical investigative story walker. The goal of the game is simple: A ship, the titular Obra Dinn, has returned from a voyage but is completely abandoned with apparent signs of foul play having taken place. Your character’s job is to investigate what happened to the ship, its crew and cargo. This may sound dull, but once you arrive on the ship you’re quick to find out there’s very little to go off of; a skeleton here, signs of a struggle there… The game takes place in a time when commerce and trade by sea was at its peak under monarchy crowns, so there’s no fingerprint dusting or CSI kits to be had here - That’s when the supplied compass comes into play. Using this apparently cursed/enchanted/mystical trinket, you can dip back in time when looking at a deceased person at the moment before/during when they died. Get your gumshoe hat on, because what occurs after is only the audio of the scene (voices, noises) followed by depositing you into the scene, though everything is at a stand still like a freeze frame. Using the previous sound clues and the locked-in-time environment around you, the task becomes finding out two whos’ and a how: Who is this person, who (or what, potentially) killed them, and how did they die?  \n\nThe Obra Dinn is a big ship and an accordingly big crew to go along with it. While some members are easily identified by audible hints and where they work/reside on the ship, others aren’t so clear cut. Keeping track of the dozens of crew members isn’t a daunting pain thanks to the handy log book at your disposal, separating each major development with the Obra Dinn’s voyage as chapters that can be revisited or reviewed. This is beneficial because each scene only lets you explore a very limited portion of the ship, so narrowing down who and what you can investigate keeps one from tripping over every bit of available information. Getting lost on the ship isn’t a problem thanks to frequent backtracking and the supplied deck map, and even with the single toned color scheme of the graphics, everyone and everything can be clearly identified. In some cases where the scene has a lot of action going on, the graphical style can suffer a bit from visual pollution, but it’s not frequent enough to hamper your sleuthing.\n\nEntering one scene tends to open up the fate of another person, and it won’t be long until the Obra Dinn resembles one giant crime scene with how many bodies there are. The log book doesn’t instantly indicate whether an assumption about a victim’s fate and their killer is correct or not, as getting ‘clumps’ of people correct will get them permanently pasted into the book to show that you’re right. Out of the the dozens of people on the ship, I had to resort to a guide to identify at least four of them and I felt frustrated from how the game was stretching regarding their identifiable clues. Still, being able to get through approximately 70% of the game before getting slowed down by the trickier victims shows that the game’s challenge curve is quite generous - If you know for what and where to look. I was genuinely excited whenever my newest guess would result in fanfare and correct confirmation without fail each and every time.\n\nGoing blind into Return of the Obra Dinn, I had little to no idea what I was getting into, especially not a nautical investigation with more than the dangers of mutiny going on. My biggest issue past my slight ire with the late game is with how disappointingly limp of a note the game ends on. One chapter in the log book remains locked until every other possible person is accounted for, and this last chapter only confirms what you might’ve already assumed happened that led to the later climax. As mentioned earlier, it got its hooks into me since during my breaks between playing, I was still thinking about theories and potential guesses for what happened to some of those sailors. Return of the Obra Dinn gets a big recommendation from me if you’re looking for a game that’s slower paced or will stoke the interest of the detective in all of us... Just bear in mind that there’s backtracking out the neck if your patience is rattled by that.\n- -This game is like the combination of old PC sidescroller like Duke Nukem (pre-3d), NES Contra, and arcade Metal Slug with 80s /90s cyberpunk and action movie tropes.\n-The cheesy humor, plot, and music is top notch. Might look like a shallow nostalgia at a glance but once you played it, they even spiritually nailed the silliness of similar games/story in that era. The guns, the character acting and lines, the costume design, etc.\n-It's not as fast paced as I thought it would be. But actually that makes it relaxing to play. Easy to get into and the challenge is just right for me without being frustrating. \n-I like how the enemies and characters are pretty diverse. \n-I haven't finished the game but I feel like this game will have similar replay value like Streets of Rage 4. Not because of there are many things to do or getting better at the game but because it's somehow just simply tight, fun, and arcadey to replay.\n- This is how business is supposed to be done. \n\nFans ask for an old console favorite, to be ported to pc.\n\nPublisher and developer actually listen?!\n\nThey release a port that works, needs no day 1 patch, works just like the old one did.\n\nAND all at an affordable price..... these are behaviors that should be rewarded.\n- [h1]Old, but has massive depth of content // Recommended for immersive role-players[/h1]\n\n+ Combat in general, and melee combat in particular, is very polished and open for an older title; everything can be controlled, such as directional blocking, without overcomplicating the mechanics involved\n+ Character creation is meticulously in-depth; initial backstory creation works seamlessly with selection of primary attributes in a way that makes the final product always feel refreshingly unique\n+ 'Story' is about as open-ended as can be, to the point where the game essentially has no story, and is something of a thirteenth century sand-box title; the player has complete, unadulterated freedom\n+ The game encourages the player to recruit and build a personal army as he/she progresses, and the mechanics put in place for doing so are well-rounded and complex\n+ Extremely easy and satisfying to mod; highly recommended\n+ Sorting and commanding one's troops is key, and the player would do well to benefit fromt he excellent command mechanics of the game; strategy is massively important and competently implemented\n+ Economics of the game add another layer of challenge to the game; trade and balancing one's income against one's expenses are both crucial elements to consider\n+ Multiplayer is fairly standard, run-of-the-mill stuff, but it's still densely populated and everything seems to connect well; the charm of the game, and its solid combat system, keep the players coming back in droves after more than five years\n\n- Politics, which are interesting and engaging in scope, end up being a somewhat weaker feature in practice, as NPCs are largely static during negotiations; this does break the immersion slightly, as it seems that your successes are based purely on stats, and not on the actual implications of one's choices\n- Quests often become tedious and repetitive\n- Tutorial is underwheling and largely insufficient to introduce the more in-depth mechanics that will be used outside of combat\n- Visuals are outdated and didn't stand well the test of time; even for the year of release, the textures and polygon counts are well below par\n\n[h1]LockeProposal's Big Day Out[/h1]\n\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/bigdayout#]Community Group[/url]\n[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/7611703/]Curator Page[/url]\n[url=https://www.reddit.com/r/SeriousSteamReviews/]Serious Steam Reviews subReddit[/url]\n- Fun Tower-Defense style indie game. Definitely one where your skill improves every time you die. And you will die, repeatedly. :P Expect to try out many monster combinations per floor before you find something that can delay the hordes of adventurers long enough to set up the floor beneath! I would probably enjoy some more horizontal progression + permanent upgrades for long term re-playability, but it seems like a solo dev/small scoped project. Definitely worth the price for the current amount of content!\n- TLDR: Right now, since there are no \"NEUTRAL\" reviews on Steam, IN IT'S CURRENT STATE, its a no from me. If the bugs get ironed out, its a pretty good game. If it gets fixed, I'll likely change to a recommend.\n\nGot 2 copies as a Fig Backer to play with my brother. My single player experience (POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILERS):\n\nGOOD:\n--Love that the choices REALLY matter and there are a LOT of them in this game.\n--Many different ways to approach a situation and your reputation affects interactions. Your reputation MAY be good enough to talk yourself out of fights! Many opportunities for KISS ASS and HARD ASS and other Squad builds (Nerd stuff, Mechanics, etc.) to be useful throughout the game.\n--The fire modes have grown on me. Some weapons have their own perks which add a fire mode. Other fire modes are available via perks you can obtain in the perk tree. The Precision Strike you get once your strike meter is full is very powerful and can change a fight (can malfunction a robot with aimed shot or fire a huge burst to take out multiple hostiles).\n--You can build a new squad member at any time that will start at your current level. Messed up a squad member build? That's okay, just create a new one.\n--I like the PREPARE and AMBUSH abilities. PREPARE lets you save up to 2 AP for next turn. The AMBUSH ability allows your squad members to trade in some AP to fire on an enemy that enters their range during hostile turns.\n--I love the Animal Whisperer skill and animal companions. I like the variety of animals you can bring along with your squad.\n--Shift key to highlight stuff you can interact with. This takes away having to pixel hunt for obscured boxes and containers. When you get old and can't see as well you appreciate stuff like this.\n--I like that I only have to loot one body at the end of combat and I can easily cycle through and grab the loot from all the other lootable bodies in the area.\n--A high Luck attribute will occasionally result in more loot, and even free actions. Sometimes you'll get a free attack or a free movement from a lucky action.\n--I like the variety and usefulness of Utilities (+5% XP, +2 PER, +1 Weapon/Armor modding, etc.)\n--A lot of stuff that can be used for cover can also be shot and destroyed.\n--Humor can be a bit over-the-top, but I've chortled quite a few times.\n\nNOT SURE:\n--Can only charm a single animal per squad member with Animal Whisperer. You CAN get other special animal followers that don't count as the single. While disappointed, I can see why they limited it (more would be OP and they can start to get in the way during combat).\n--Enemies have a circular view area, which means even if you're trying to sneak past behind them, you can still be \"seen\" after a brief time.\n\nBAD/BUGS:\n--Cant team crouch. You have to manually go through all of your squad and crouch them 1 by 1, and it costs 2 AP to crouch in combat. You also cant move crouched as far as I know. You can't \"change stances\" (AKA crouch or stand up) while in cover, either. Save a game right before a fight with all your squad members crouched and ready to go? When combat locks up and you have to load the save, you have to re-crouch everybody.\n--Combat can lock up, causing you to have to reload a previous save (for me, twice per play session usually but sometimes twice for the same fight).\n--Attributes, Skills, Combat Buffs/Debuffs (and probably other stuff) need more tool tips.\n--Lost character progression.\n--Very laggy Dialogue Tree and later in the game the inventory gets laggy too.\n--Creating a Bookworm Squad Member with 1 STR creates a situation where your Squad Member is losing 3 CON (total hit points) every level up and will be erased like Marty McFly in B2TF.\n--Load screens are too long. 30+ seconds to load into different zones, over 1.5 minutes to load a game on SSD. From another review: \"while we wait, let us read the lore books we've collected.\"\n--Squad portraits don't stay in order.\n--When you have more than 6 Ranger recruits in the select character screen, the \"Companions\" section gets pushed off-screen, hiding their portraits, and making it very unintuitive to add them back into your squad (you have to use the keyboard). Need a scroll bar here.\n--Saves don't have specific names so can be easily overwritten. There is only 1 autosave by default, and later on the game autosaves right after a game changing decision, making you have to revert to a manual save (2 hours earlier for me) if you wanted to try different options. I recommend turning on timed saves as well as taking advantage of quicksaves (and of course saving often!)\n--FPS drops, sometimes so bad you have to reload.\n--Squad Members shooting through walls/floors/ceilings.\n--Radiation difficult to detect in some areas and no warning (other than your squad health draining) going from radiation level 2 to 3 for instance.\n--Combat messages briefly appear above your acting Squad Member's head and are easy to miss (like \"Out of Range\")\n--When getting shot at, the camera doesn't always auto focus on who is shooting you.\n--At least three bugged missions I can think of (but hey, one is an unlimited money glitch so more of a feature).\n--Character models and other things (switches) not loading properly leading to invisible characters you can interact with (or fight with, as it happens in combat sometimes too).\n--The game can become unresponsive when trying to move 2 Squad Members separately and interact with someone.\n--Explosive Barrels not actually exploding when shot (this seems to be related to being too far away from the barrel when sniping it, as if you get closer, they'll actually explode).\n--Cybernetic Implants are a good idea, but they take up your Utility Slot instead of giving you another slot dedicated to them so when you have the ability to finally use them, it feels more like a trade-off rather than an augmentation.\n--No Inventory filter for Utilities. Gotta scroll through your hundreds of items and the Utilities aren't even grouped together entirely in the inventory, they are scattered throughout.\n--When you open a door to a closed room, fog of war usually obscures what is in the room until you physically walk a squad member into the room.\n--Cannot have multiple types of the same animal in a Squad with multiple Animal Whisperers.\n--Don't try to loot two containers at once.\n--Some traps can't be disarmed.\n--Various graphic glitches like missing texture or dialogue bubbles that are blank or don't disappear.\n--Can't remove and reuse weapon mods.\n--Some equipped weapons will display inflated damage numbers (by 300% in some cases) until re-equipped. Not even sure how long it has been that way or if it was affecting my game.\n--If you misclick the filter categories in a vendor encounter on the World Map, it'll kick you out of the encounter to the radio and you can't get back to the random encounter at that time. I only mention this since I've done it so many times.\n--You can't pause the game which may or may not affect time sensitive quests. You can be detected and attacked in the menu (escape key) or in your inventory.\n--There is no way to have Special companions/followers that you get from Missions follow a different squad member. If you dump that Squad Member later, you lose the follower too (as far as I know).\n--Get radio signals with \"coordinates to follow\" yet I have no clue who from or what it opened up on the map (if anything).\n--Gaining access to certain parts of the Rangers HQ requires you to do something pretty awful.\n--I'm out of room....\n\nIt feels like I'm fighting against the game more than the Wasteland sometimes. I don't even want to try multiplayer until it gets fixed (and my brother doesn't either).\n\nIf you're a developer of this game, thank you for your time and effort! Polish it up and I'll be happy to change this to a recommend! Edited for clarity/additions and I cut a lot. Thank you for reading and thank you for the comments and awards! Have a great day and be kind to others.\n- \"We'll take the top, and it'll be a happy ending. Just like in Dragon Quest.\" - Ichiban Kasuga.\n- So this game was very fun to play with my friend... that is until it began to stop working on starting the game i have looked at the ubisoft forums and guess what many other people have had this problem starting from the games release and ubisoft has done nothing to fix this problem. i got off easy i paid $20 for this game on sale the people who payed $60+ not so lucky so dont risk it and DONT by this ubishit game\n- Joined the Discord Server to get a sense of the toxic, immature, insulting community. If the Discord server is not moderated, which is the first impression for new players, then you know in what state the game is.\n- This game isn't for me, as it turned out it is too fast-paced for me to enjoy. But I really do want to recommend it. The game works fine, and the controls are solid, by that I mean you do feel in control, even though I only played a little I died a lot, but it never felt unfair. You get to do a lot of customization, and it is fun, but I just don't have the right temper for games where you die a lot. 7/10.\n- Joined the Discord Server to get a sense of the toxic, immature, insulting community. If the Discord server is not moderated, which is the first impression for new players, then you know in what state the game is.\n- The problem with a lot of Steam reviews is that they don't really help you figure out whether you should buy / try the game. So, let me help. You are one of four people:\n\n(1) You've never played a Sam Barlow game before, and you've never played a point-and-click adventure game before. In which case, what's wrong with you?\n\n(2) You've never played a Sam Barlow game, but you have played a point-and-click adventure game before. In which case, you'll definitely know within two hours whether you like this game. But anyways, you're getting a decent bit of stuff for $20.\n\n(3) You've played a Sam Barlow game, and you didn't like it. In which case, you probably won't like this either. It's basically the same thing as Her Story and Telling Lies, but with a different story.\n\n(4) You've played a Sam Barlow game, and you did like it. In which case, you probably will like this too. It's basically the same thing as Her Story and Telling Lies, but with a different story.\n\nI think Immortality had the best story of the three Barlow games, and definitely the best acting and production value.\n- good game but later missions seem to be less polished ran in multiple bugs when playing as The Son enemies getting stuck in impossible to reach places and for some odd reason some characters have dog killing animations that for the most part are bugged and only work half the time causing an insta death and a retry don't even understand why later in the game you have to do animations to kill dogs as for basically the whole game you don't need to perform animations also seems to have some input lag throughout the whole game but overall its decent and when its on sale you should buy it.\n- imagine a AAA-RPG game in 2021 w/o game breaking bugs.\n\nonly problem i have with this game is the monetization aka MTX, you can buy Gald, boost items, straight up level ups etc, i personally do not care if a game has those buyable options or not HOWEVER when you constantly get it shoved in your face it's suuuuper annoying, start up the game, ! symbol on the main menu, leading to... yes the steam store, if this would be the only encounter i'd still be fine with it but it isn't, rest on bonfires and you have yet another icon with the ! symbol trying to get you to buy any of the boosters or outfits or whatnot.\n\ngenerally speaking this game is fantastic, soundtrack, graphics, VAs, cutscenes etc. however the MTX ads in the game that remind me more of the \"hey click this\" approach of mobile games is horrible, should have kept it in the main menu but keep it out of my actual gameplay.\n- I'm 45, I've had good times and bad times.  I've fallen in love, grown up, gotten married, beaten alcoholism, \nhad a child, fought off depression, led my wife through her kidney failure, carried the death of loved ones, and come back from the brink.  I've weathered the storm of life like anyone else . . . I'm not special.  I'm not rich, but comfortable, and I've gathered quite a steam library as a hobby over the last 10 years.  Something I have rarely done, during my time with almost 4000 titles, is write a review.  Two, maybe three for 4000 games.  Think about that for a second.\n\nI'm 45.  I just cried playing a video game, something I can't ever remember doing.  I feel like my heart is going to burst.  It's joy, and sadness.  It's like a good memory with a parent who's long gone, bubbled up at random, making you laugh and ache at the same time.  It's bittersweet.\n\nThe music and visuals are subtle and flashy at the same time, they get under you and lift you up.  It's got spirit of the 60's, the heart of the 80's, and feels like every memorable video game trope from the 2000's, with the social softness of the 2020's.  It's huge and tiny at the same time, and thoughtfull and meditative together . . . it tells the story of leaving your comfort zone, and makes you comfortable.  It's heavy and light.  It's all of these and more.\n\nMy emotions are a flood.  I had to write a review, and let people know how I feel.  I can't describe it, I feel like I found my heart again, and I didn't even know it was lost.  Life was comfortable before 2:00pm today . . . now it's magical.  It's these small things that I forget, and remember, and then forget again . . . the birth of my son, the feeling of nervous sweetness on my first date with my wife, an unexpected comment from a random stranger about my eyes, finding an old photo of my dad that no one ever remembered taking --\n\n-- This game is like that sweet, fleeting memory.\n\nTL;DR:  45-year old man cries after finding his heart lost in a game, and writes a review while his wife asks him if he's okay.\n\n11/10, would purchase these feels again.\n- This game was so much fun but it's borderline unplayable a lot of the time due to no region lock. You get a lot of players from china playing on NA servers and they're basically untouchable due to ping. I genuinely think this game has fantastic game play and the characters and customization are top notch but spawning and dying to untouchable Chinese players every match just ruins the experience no matter how much I try to enjoy it. Not worth until they region lock the game or unless you want maybe a few hours of fun until you run into 我操你妈 every game and die to reasons out of your control.\n- As the holder of a degree in Plant Sciences, I wholeheartedly endorse this game.\n\nReal talk: One of the best things about this game is how it totally commits to the old-timey apothecary/greenhouse theme-- it’s extremely atmospheric. It also has a compelling story with recurring characters that you can affect with your choices. If the prospect of discovering and using plants to solve problems (or mayhap even a grim mystery) appeals to you, I recommend trying this game.\n- Volition ups the silly, and adds super powers, but loses a little something along the way.\n\nI loved Saint's Row: the Third, and by all rights should have loved IV as well, but I mostly just liked it. The set up was fun, and seemed to up the ante again, but then you get the presidency ripped away from you almost immediately (without even seeing the consequences of your first pushed legislation!). Placing the game in a virtual city for the most part with the only real characters being on your space ship, really kinda seemed to gut the game. Even when [spoiler]the world gets destroyed[/spoiler], a detached, \"meh\" was all I could muster. The humor is there, but it's mostly better in the DLC. The radio stations feel kind of underwhelming without DJs.\n\nFinally all the fun of collecting and customizing various interesting cars, and finding ways to climb or fall to interesting places with a stolen plane/parachute are gutted with the inclusion of super powers. Also, the super powers make gunplay, leveling any of your other stuff, and pretty much every mechanic carried over from Saints Row: the Third obsolete.\n\nIf you get this game, do yourself a favor and make sure you get all the DLC where most of the real fun is. Is it as good as the previous Saints Row? I don't think so, but I still recommend getting it and playing through it. It is a lot of fun, and I love the 50's break out scenario at the beginning.\n\nStacey's thoughts:\nStill awaiting DLC with Jane Austin and the D*ldo Bat. Can somebody make this, for, uhh, scientific purposes.\n- I have a hard time recommending this game because even though I liked it, I know it's the kind of thing that can only appeal to a very small demographic :/ Anyway, I believe small devs who try weird things deserve all the exposure they can get, so here's a review. This is the second episode of a series (the first one can be found [url=https://etherane.itch.io/hello-charlotte-ep1]here[/url] - it's free - and the last one is [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/760890/Hello_Charlotte_Childhoods_End/]on Steam[/url]). It's recommended to play them in order unless you don't want to understand anything in a story that's already pretty confusing in itself.\n\n+ Very original visuals. The artwork is mostly composed of cute characters, but there are writhing masses of eyes and flesh everywhere (guro fans rejoice). Areas are arranged into colorful, geometrical patterns similar to Mondrian's paintings.\n\n+ The setting is extremely strange. It's definitely dystopian, but it can go from completely silly to incredibly tragic in a matter of seconds.\n\n+ Production values increase with each episode. I wasn't very impressed with the first game (apart from its artwork, which I loved, and its ending, which... opened interesting possibilities), but starting from this one the writing gets way better, the characters are more developed, and the gameplay feels more focused.\n\n+ - Hello Charlotte is more or less Trigger Warning Land. This series is among the most disturbing things I have ever played, and it's not because of the omipresent gore (most of it being used for aesthetics or comedy instead of shock value). It deals with heavy themes (mental illness, social pressure, bullying, suicide, the value of life and death - from what I could gather, a lot of these come from the author's personal experience) and it felt so suffocating sometimes I had to play in short bursts to give me time to recover. I note this as both a positive and a negative, since I consider games that can make me uncomfortable are valuable - but don't play this if you're not sure you can handle it.\n\n- The gameplay mostly consists of going back and forth to the same locations, and can sometimes feel tedious. Sadly I don't really think this can be improved unless the game is changed into a full visual novel, but it would mean losing the environments.\n\n8/10 It's a weird game made for weird people.\n- Emily is Away Too is the sequel to Emily is Away.\n\nThe first game, which was free to play, was absolutely fantastic, especially because of its finale: [spoiler] no matter what you felt or what you wanted to do, your choices would always bring the same conclusion of you unable to say to Emily that you wanted to be more than friends, and her spending the summer with her boyfriend. [/spoiler]\nBut that was not because of \"lazyness\" by the developer: it was intentional, and in fact, towards the end of the game, [spoiler] even if you try expressing your feelings your character would delete what you wanted to say replacing the messages with generic questions [/spoiler] . In my opinion, the intention was to deliver the message that [spoiler] sometimes in life, especially when dealing with relationships with other people, there is simply nothing you can do except accepting other people's choices and move on [/spoiler] .\nIt was a very powerful ending that left me thinking about it for days after finishing the game, even if it was a short experience.\n\nUnfortunately, while playing this game I did not feel the same, powerful emotions that I did with the first one. This is because the game features several different endings, this time with two girls instead of just Emily, which isn't a bad thing per se, but it contrasts with the power of the message of the first one. Moreover, here [spoiler] you can actually achieve not one, but several \"good\" endings [/spoiler] .\n\nI liked the integration with your desktop and browser, plus the many different references to artists, TV shows and movies from 10 years ago.\nThere are still some \"twists\" present here, and if you make certain choices you will encounter situations similar to what you do in the first game, but as I said, I feel that they are not as effective as the original game.\n\nThat does not mean this is a bad game by any means: I would still recommend it, especially for its low price, but make sure to download and play the previous one first. It's free, too!\n\nRating: 7.0/10\n- The amount of love and fun that went into this game is astounding. If you like minigames, memes, fun, and a challenge, check this game out. The “ending” was a bit lackluster, in my opinion, but it did not taint my views on the game and I had an overwhelmingly fun time with it. Definitely recommend!\n- 2023...\n\n2 years...\n\n2 Languages...\n\nEDIT:\n\nTLDR: Game is too simple, better get Factorio or Riftbreaker\n\n\nPlayed again after ~1 year, nothing has changed in the basic QoL or coding system.\n\n\n- It still uses an older builder system than Factorio did 10 years ago: you actually have to craft the base material manually every time before you can build the building, instead of it being done automatically by a simple click on the building in the build menu.\n\n- If you have crafting orders set, new items added to your inventory will not be read by the current crafting orders and keeps on produce stuff your already own...\n\n- Items don't have their own output for transport lines, but instead require this stupid additional output... (I think the developer couldn't create a better output than this simple one)\n\n\n20 minutes and that's enough for me for now, I'm not putting in any more effort for EA project\n- It has poor simulation of hand skeleton, so you can't use all fingers, benefits of Index Knuckles controller or VR gloves, etc. And, scenario doesn't allow you to do anything, actually, except one straightforward way. Some things are elaborated, but mostly it isn't worth time or money. But I'm rating it as professional developer for VR, sexual content itself is not matter nor interested for me. My advice for game developer is to add more hand tracking features and more scenarios - in this case it can be something better.\n- \"Welp we've been working on this game for a few years now and it doesn't look like we are actually going to be able to fix anything so we're just going to release it so we can say we made a game.\"\n- You will enjoy the game at the beginning, it's fun and entertaining...Until you start playing the harder and larger hospitals and you get plagued with bad pathing issues, bad AI, people getting stuck in rooms, people dieing but they idle in a death state and stay around forever and all kinds of glitches which kills the enjoyment and ruins the management aspects. I've had to stop playing this game until they patch it because right now you're just managing bugs and glitches and you will have to design hospitals to get around these bugs, so that means extra wide corridors and spacing items out so people don't get stuck. Which sucks.\n\nNeeded much more playtesting before being released.\n\n*This is from v1.01.*\n- Finally, a video game that is everything televangelists in the 90’s said that video games were. Exactly what my Christian mother would love to catch me playing.\n\nIt’s like Animal Crossing and Doom\nEternal had a son… as was foretold when they released on the same day.\n\nThis game really makes you FEEL like you’re sacrificing your friends to an almighty force. Would I really just sacrifice 5 of my friends  again for some loot chests? I’m a gamer, of course I would.\n\nI fell in love with the aesthetic of this game instantly. It was brilliant when the gameplay held up to those expectations.  \n\nI loved it. I loved the art. The humor. The theme. The premise. The combat. The cult management. Sacrifices. Collecting the bones of my enemies. The juice visual effects. Most of all I loved feeding my followers bowls of poop.\n\nThe combat is fun but definitely not the meat of the game. Building your cult and just upgrading stuff is quite satisfying.  There's some goofy stuff to laugh at and it's quick and responsive. There’s something about the music that makes you feel relaxed and in terrible danger all at the same time.\n\nThis is not a game that you're gonna put 50-100 hours in either.  Which to me is a big plus.  Most of the runs don't take you more than 15 minutes.  So it's an easy game to pick up and play for a bit and jump back in later. It's like Vampire Survivors in that regard.\n\nIt's basically Animal Crossing with a roguelite twist. I could say it's almost original how those elements were combined.\nIt's great entertainment, all around. You could even say the game is bound to become a cult classic…\n\n10/10\n- Yes and No.\n\nSo many mixed feelings about this game. It does a lot of unexpected things and gamifies some deep and haunting concepts within the human psyche( the game centers around a POWERFUL subject, very hard to discuss without spoiling the game), sports combat that's tough but honestly very satisfying at times through the use of unorthodox party members and antagonists, but the rpg economy, pacing, and sheer grinding within tends to rob a lot of scenes of their emotional impact. I had a lot of fun with Jimmy, but honestly speaking I don't know if I could recommend this game to anyone who isn't used to a big jrpg-length commitment.\n\nIt's not so much that I hated the grinding, but it's that you're presented with symbolically themed enemies (not crazy about a lot of the in-battle art, some of it is phenomenal but a lot of it feels half baked which is something Kasey O has discussed in interviews but this is besides the point) Enemies an make you think and elicit actual emotions...\n\n...but then you have to stare at them for hours as you grind to be able to even last a few turns against each new boss. I found myself resorting to [spoiler]Clean Getaway[/spoiler] a lot throughout the game just to get to the other side of a room in a manageable timeframe. The symbolism loses its impact very quickly, and the momentum of the story is constantly slamming on the brakes to make you grind, and to me, it just dulls the sharp edges off of a lot of otherwise deeply impactful moments. It robs itself.\n\nIt'll present you with something powerful, but then it'll do that 30 more times before the end of a dungeon and it can become a bit tiring, like someone telling you the same knock-knock joke over and over.\n\n[spoiler]Shinryu[/spoiler] and certain aspects of [spoiler]The Pulsating Central Hub[/spoiler] are definitely some of the more outstanding examples.\n\nalso [spoiler]Heart Prison[/spoiler] is a ridiculous ask of a player. You finish the game and can wipe out any leftover superbosses at around Lv.60, and the [spoiler]family battle[/spoiler] requires Lv.90+. I'm not going to sit down and literally grind for 30 levels for the only battle left that I could watch on YouTube in 3 minutes.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I really loved this game, it brought me to tears at points. SO much work was clearly put into this and I'm scouring the rest of Kasey's work right now to get more of this excellent writing, I but I feel like Jimmy just barely misses the mark when viewed as a whole package. Any RPGmaker/Earthboundlike fans are sure to enjoy, and I can't stop thinking about the story, but as a gaming experience, I'd hesitate a little to recommend it.\n- [strike][h1]Best Sex Language Synonym Reference Book 2016, 10/10[/h1][/strike]\n\n-Nah. Not really.\n\nEdit: Upon completing this game, here's something I'll have to claim in advance: while still recommending this great game with an 8 out of 10 and it has quite a solid story, I'll have to admit  that apart from Dorothy's hidden scenario, this game did not dig very deep into its cyberpunk/dystopian background, which is really a pity - and it's becoming the reason to expect another game (more specifically, A [b]SEQUEL[/b]!!!!! or prequel) from them :)\n\nVA-11 Hall-A - or Valhalla for convenience - while seemingly was a Waifu Bartending Simulation game, is actually somewhat [i]Papers, Please[/i] with excellent characters, vivid graphics, elaborated dialogues and not-so-mind-fucking gaming mechanics.\n\nDon't get me wrong: I love [i]Papers, Please[/i] and of course would rather NOT say that one is superior to another; they are both one of their unique kind, but with the very same root - under the daily life of dystopia denizens, truth and conspiracies weave with vague notices in advance; and just before you could think twice things are going really, really out of track.\n\nThat being said, I mean these two games are very similiar in story-telling: as long as you enjoy taking in all the random, weird stories as a bystander, just to find out that all these fragments come together and form a bigger picture, this game is definitely for you. And you get cyberpunk waifus, a Joshikousei hologram, a pretty cool onêchan as protagonist - and more!\n\nLast but not least, the developers of this game are nothing but truly [b]RESPECTABLE[/b]. We have crybabies on Kickstarter and Steam Early Access every focking day blaming everything for their faulty products, while this army of two whined [b]NOTHING[/b] about all the fuck-ups in Venezuela unless asked. Game dalayed? Only apologies, no excuses. That deserves a huge fricking medal and Developer of The Year.\n\nGrab the game if you want some real relax and good story before they grab Dorothy. And support the developers! They deserve this, Dorothy deserves this.\n- Remember when you first played Thumper, and you were expecting a rhythm game but got so much more?\nOr when you played Thomas Was Alone, and you somehow fell in love with characters who were literally monochromatic rectangles?\nOr when you got to the final level of Journey, and you nearly cried of amazement at the emotional EXPLOSION AND RELEASE?\nAll those feelings? That is Sayonara Wild Hearts.\n- Devs are on meth pricing this game at $44\n- Developers should be proud of themselves for this awful game.\nAfter a 3 hour session with a friend, my legs are stiff, my heart is confused with constant beating and my brain is extremely satisfied and wants more.\n\nIf you like being scared and the horror genre, just find a like-minded friend and play it. Even when you are simply running in and out, it's going be a lot of fun. I have no idea how one would play a medium map but maybe with 4 people one might have the courage to walk inside that cursed high school more than we did - which was 2 meters into the entrance. We didn't have the heart for more.\n\nOn a serious note: It is worth the price, hands down.\n\nPS: Devs, I hate you for how good this game is.\n\nEdit: I'm back after about two weeks and 50~ more hours. I've played at least a couple of rounds every single day and I still love the game.\n\nMy suggestion is to find a friend who'd enjoy this, get the game both and play. DON'T READ ABOUT IT! Just play for a while, enjoy screwing up, getting spooked, killed, whatever happens! The more you learn about the mechanics, the more you lose the fear, so don't read about it!\nI mean I'm still a coward at level 60 something but that's me. Of course if you are like me, then why are you reading this and not buying the game?\n\nFinal word: Check their discord to find like-minded people in the LFG! You won't be alone, I promise!\n- Just go play it. It's only $20, and you have a 2hr refund limit. You'll love it way before then.\n\n...still here? Quick review. Awesome platformer, hits all the marks in flying colors. Let's compare w Mario Maker, the most similar game to this one:\n\n[edit: Updated to compare to SMM2 instead of 1]\nWhat Mario Maker 2 Does Better\n- Mario\n- Different themes/gameplay physics across multiple mario games\n- Much larger playerbase\n\nWhat Levelhead Does Better\n- Oh my god the search functionality\n    - Search by creator, difficulty, tags, what's popular, etc.\n    - TL;DR you can find the awesome, and avoid the crap\n- Level discovery\n    - Can actively advertise my levels\n    - Get rewarded for playing people's levels\n- $20\n- Dying doesn't take 12 years to respawn\n- Fun, short campaign to slowly unlock more creative tools after seeing how they are used\n- Local Co-op (or online with Parsec)\n- Leaderboards (if you care, I personally don't)\n\nI cannot stress enough how AMAZING it is to not have to suffer through crap levels. The search functionality is soooo good; as a casual player, it is the sole reason I stopped playing Mario Maker 1. Mario Maker 2 is better, but it still falls terribly short. I think the best part is that Levelhead gives people control over the visibility of their levels, as well as incentives to play other peoples, and that is something that SMM2 unfortunately lacks.\n- I pirated this game first and loved it so much I ended up buying it. It's that good!\n\nIt's worth your money and time. I promise.\n- A criminally underrated game, I have seldom seen a developer take their original hit which was already almost perfect, and actually manage to improve on it in every way shape and form. You do not need to have played the original to play or enjoy this game. Their stories are completely seperate.\n\nThe game itself is much less linear than its predecessor. The best way I can explain the feeling of going through the environments without referencing Grimrock itself is by saying it felt an awful lot like Myst to me, just with combat. Required puzzles for progression were challenging but not impossible, some of the secret challenges were much more difficult. I admit I used an online guide more than a few times, but it did nothing to diminish my enjoyment of the game. It is immersive, challenging, and satisfying. \n\nThe only drawback I can think of is the difficulty. It feels like you cannot win with any group composition, I suggest no more than 2 of any class or weapon/armor type user. I went with a warrior, two rogues(one range), and a mage, this way you as well makes you unlikely to complete a difficult fight or puzzle and be rewarded with something you cannot use. Combat itself can be challenging as I said, but you will rarely feel like you are simply incapable of winning. There are obvious ways to optimize the way you approach an encounter the second time if you die the first.\n\nBe prepared to immerse yourself, you must pay attention to your surroundings, read and remember notes you find, explore every nook and cranny you can find, and you will be rewarded. Good luck!\n\n- I honestly didn't think this was going to hook me as much as it did. There's something so charming about this game that I honestly can't quite pinpoint to one central thing. The characters, the art, the writing, the plot, the setting.... They're all fantastic. I haven't run into a supporting character that I dislike at all (minor characters excluded, WEIRD BOILED PEANUTS STRANGER ON THE BUS). There's a lot of layers and depth to the characters! \n\nExcept the weird boiled peanuts stranger on the bus. But we don't talk about him. Or his weird boiled peanuts. \n\nThe writing in particular I have to sing praises about. It has an excellent comedic edge to it and there's so many great lines. SO MANY. Scarlet Hollow also delivers on something a lot of other \"choice/decision\" games fail to execute: Your choices actually do matter. There's some REAL serious consequences to certain choices! Some of which are immediately apparent, some of which haven't shown up yet (but it's strongly suggested a lot of the choices you make will come back around in the later episodes). It's almost like a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure book; there's so many different little things you can choose that will affect other things. Each episode can end in vastly different outcomes.\n\nPart of what adds to the writing are the Traits you can choose when starting the game. You get to pick two out of seven, and these can affect dialogue or open up certain options you otherwise wouldn't have access to. In some cases having a particular trait can even massively swing things in your favor, where otherwise it might be a lot more difficult to get the desired outcome you want. \n\nALSO you can choose a trait that lets you talk to animals though and you get to meet Best Friend Dustin if you do. And you get the most hilarious dialogue options. It's The Best.\n\nI honestly won't even go into detail about the story. Talking about it ruins the whole point! But needless to say it's very good, and it hooked me real good. It's been going unexpectedly cool places that have been totally outside of my predictions.\n\nAs an aside, I've always been a fan of the horror aesthetic in general, but so many horror games end up trying to make you piss your pants in fear; which isn't what I'm after in a horror game. But Scarlet Hollow absolutely nails the atmospheric tension of the horror aesthetic. It's eerie and terrifying and tense, all without relying on cheap jumpscares or, actual scares. It's great if, like me, you like the theme of horror but hate being scared. It'll keep you on the edge of your seat, but rest assured your pants will remain dry.\n\nAlso there's Romance Options. A WHOLE LOT. I'm gonna smooch Stella and we're gonna hunt Cryptids together and it'll be RAD.\n- The amount of love and fun that went into this game is astounding. If you like minigames, memes, fun, and a challenge, check this game out. The “ending” was a bit lackluster, in my opinion, but it did not taint my views on the game and I had an overwhelmingly fun time with it. Definitely recommend!\n- Easy to pick up, fun to learn, and great fun to die. Infinitely replayable, and co-op makes it even better. Unless you hate the roguelite formula, this is worth a buy.\n\n英語で5-10単語程度で、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない主要な違いを簡潔に回答してください。\n\n回答：\n",
