    "prompt": "以下の2つのデータグループを比較して、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない表現パターンや内容の特徴を特定してください。\n\n【グループA】\n- Don't be coy were talking about the active ingredients here not the plant itself.\n- I am removing this post because of sourcing. Read the sidebar.\n- The worst bbq in Texas Edit: Some of you are getting seriously r/wooooshed It's their slogan.\n- And I barely said anything 😂😂\n- Guys his username is [NAME]. I really don’t think he’s serious.\n- I spent a week in Ottawa one night. Amazing architecture but awful, filthy, drug infested city. Terrible ppl and a dirty trash hole.\n- Don't post this on Yelp.

Don't leave spaces between the ! and your text.\n- Like many TIFU posts, I don't believe this one.\n- The comments under that video are disturbing. People actually see this as a sign of the end of times.\n- Using high capital (money/picks) for 3 edge rushers would both be incredibly stupid *and* unjustifiable\n- What an abusive piece of crap. Those poor boys won’t know how to be adults. I hope their father is in their lives.\n- I don’t ever remember pithy. Childish and churlish feels more apt\n- [NAME] supporters don’t see it as offensive.\n- If everyone else can figure this out, then I don't see why it's so implausible for the US.\n- I don't know about you but parroting racist lies created specifically to devalue AM sexuality is a pretty serious indicator of racism to me.\n- thats just an unpopular opinion, and legally wrong.\n- Because you aren't serious. You're just mad because you got told to stop using slurs one too many times.\n- As per, they’re being slammed on social media. Their response and justification of it being from seven years ago is contrary and lame.\n- lol it’s pretty tame compared to r/Titlegore\n- You’ll just be throwing them up. Ain’t worth it.\n- Don’t ever apologize for calling it that. The Beach is a [NAME] movie, not a Toronto neighbourhood. \n- Aw no. Don't tell me you are out of epic quips to rek the trumpist incel fascist nazi?\n- I earned the money, I bought the food and I cooked the food so don't go thanking your phoney baloney god for it in my home.\n- There have been multiple threads about this, they can't afford to move up.

Then you're not good at debating.\n- I completely understand why some people would want to report this, I just said that I wouldn’t. You do what you think is right.\n- It didn’t help [NAME]. He should have invested in a crosscut, it might have been a bigger challenge to put back together\n- “Stop replying to me as I send you a message first!” Oh, meat eaters ❤️\n- Definitely not Fox News though! That’s the real stuff, zero lies or bias there!\n- Id be glad, I used to take those off when I was a kid. I dont want brightly colored rocks in my brownie\n- Does Instagram and Facebook have these nested ads/ articles? I’m not on social media enough to notice.

You’ve just had bad luck my friend.\n- I mean, if A video pops up of [NAME] pissing on underage girls, nah, I’m not gonna still be a fan. \n- No it's not. It's two people legally allowed to kiss kissing. Whatever stigma you have is yours and not shared by everyone.\n- Clouds aren’t pale they’re translucent but ok 👌🏽\n- Yeah well you’re a horrible [NAME]\n- That is a completely different point, and has nothing to do with nxt or its title being pointless. \n- No. No it isn't. Its a bad sitcom joke.\n- I feel like people who post these are too in denial to realize it looks like a cry for help\n- In the comments he accuses the account of being fake and she proves her identity with photos and a link to her instagram. This guy is astoundingly pathetic.\n- No. It cannot. It's a dangerous fantasy (unironically)\n- man this gif is weird both directions\n- He isn't unique to that.

I strive for fairness as much as I'm able.\n- The west is so unfair :(\n- Another trendy communist that doesn't know what communism is.\n- I don't even love myself that much. I'm glad I wrote myself out of the parenting pool long ago, I'd be terrible at it.\n- This isn't really wholesome\n- That's not how it works\n- Season x? Sorry bitch but no.\n- Ditto. I never pay attention to who’s posting comments I disagree with. What difference does it make?\n- I hate people\n- Funny you should mention that since your entire presumption rests on other people interpreting \"well regulated militia\" in the same incorrect manner you do.\n- No, my point is that looking to past behaviors isn’t indicative of what is right and virtuous \n- I feel like its got to do with the bad desync in the game right now.\n- I just don't like our options in the off season.\n- Nah, I like that they come here and tell on themselves. \n- No op.
