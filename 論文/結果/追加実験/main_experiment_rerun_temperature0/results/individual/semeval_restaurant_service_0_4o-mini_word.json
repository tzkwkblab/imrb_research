your focus should be the $T$ .\n- Simple to use , and great $T$ .\n- Called tech support and got the usual Acer `` We do n't support $T$ but for $ $ $ we can help you '' I explained there was no software involved in booting .\n- little short on $T$ but you get what you pay for .\n- You can even get packages of the $T$ to stock your fridge !\n- Dealing with the $T$ drone on the other end of the chat was sheer torture .\n- Having not been home in the last 2 years may skew this reviewer a bit , but the $T$ was tasty and spicy sans the oil that comes floating along at similar venues .\n- It is far more popular as a bar than as a restaurant , with only a few tables and the waiter being the bartender , but we greatly enjoyed the unobtrusive $T$ .\n- Besides having the $T$ we had been promised given to other restaurant patrons twice before we were actually seated , we were served dishes we had n't ordered three times , received one of our orders 20 minutes after the rest of the table had been served -LRB- and that order was undercooked -RRB- , and charged $ 45 more than we should have been on our bill .\n- I had been a regular due to the consistently good $T$ and ease of getting a table .\n- My friends and I experienced amazing cheese and a delicious , new summer $T$ at Artisanal last night .\n- It has many great programs , such as ILife , $T$ and others .\n- Solid $T$ , knowledgeable staff , friendly owners and an adventurous , ever-changing menu keep us coming back .\n- $T$ is a varied delight and great bargain at $ 10 .\n- Our family never expected such incredible $T$ in a restaurant .\n- Only other thing is that if you are using this for document creation Apple doesnt provide any kind of $T$ -LRB- such as works for windows -RRB- , but iwork is cheap compared to office .\n- however , I may have inadvertently thrown out one of the batteries with the $T$ .\n- The food was delicious , the $T$ was relaxed , and we have now adopted Plate 347 as our Secret on Second !\n- Sure , the initial out of pocket expense is greater , but that should not dissuade anyone from the fact that these machines $T$ like none other on the planet , and when I factor in all the money in that I wasted on Geek Squad and the latest patches to de-corrupt my infested PCs , it probably comes out about even anyhow .\n- 2 . The $T$ is low quality .\n- Little Tonino 's is just awesome , our favorite delivery place in Kennsington , honestly the best $T$ I have ever had !\n- -RRB- I also purchased Applecare for $ 300 , which is a three year $T$ , since I ve never seen any laptop that lasted more than two .\n- I recommend getting a $T$ even though we saw people seated without one .\n- Has the chef and $T$ changed ???\n- There is a small red circle next to it with a x in the middle , and when I click on it it says : '' Consider replacing your battery '' and it does not hold full $T$ .\n- $T$ is running great .\n- I got it back and my built-in webcam and built-in mic were shorting out anytime I touched the lid , -LRB- mind you this was my means of communication with my fiance who was deployed -RRB- but I suffered thru it and would constandly have to reset the computer to be able to use my cam and $T$ anytime they went out .\n- We had the most wonderful $T$ .\n- you can find many laptops with the same $T$ and even better with lower price , but you can not find the look , easy , applications , and the experience in mac .\n- They did not have $T$ , forgot our toast , left out ingredients -LRB- ie cheese in an omelet -RRB- , below hot temperatures and the bacon was so over cooked it crumbled on the plate when you touched it .\n- Also , I issued a replacement RMA for a few dead pixels in the upper zone of the $T$ , which is noticable to me .\n- It drives me crazy when I want to download a game or something of that nature and I ca n't play it because its not compatable with the $T$ .\n- Unfortunately , the $T$ was NOT something to get worked up about .\n- I am pleased with the fast log on , speedy WiFi connection and the long $T$ -LRB- > 6 hrs -RRB- .\n- The $T$ was terrific and the service classy , attentive , without being overbearing .\n- Anyway , the food is good , the price is right and they have a decent $T$ .\n- I stopped by for some $T$ today and had the vegan cranberry pancakes and some rice milk .\n- We ordered a tuna melt - it came with out $T$ which just made it a tuna sandwich .\n- $T$ , also , was no problem for me when I used itunes -LRB- which usually slows down my PC -RRB- .\n- Excellent $T$ and well equipped .\n- The pro is a great product , I wish that the 13 inch models came with the Intel i processors and had a more comfortable $T$ -LRB- the edges hurt my wrists -RRB- .\n- I looked around and based off my price / $T$ comparison from a brand I trusted I landed here .\n- it has 3 $T$ , 1 sd memory card reader and an sd memory car expansion .\n- The $T$ is also very user friendly , even for those that switch from a PC , with a little practice you can take full advantage of this OS !\n- The $T$ have an outstanding taste with a terrific texture , both chewy yet not gummy .\n- It 's just everything ... the $T$ , the atmosphere ... the incrediby kind and gracious hostess .\n- Do n't expect to sit down inside though , there are only a few $T$ and they are always full .\n- While we thoroughly enjoyed the $T$ , it was annoying to scream across the table for conversation .\n- I have been here a few times for dinner , once for $T$ and twice for lunch .\n- It 's applications are terrific , including the replacements for $T$ .\n- so in a brief summary i would have to say that i would not recommend dell vostro 1000 to anyone due to it being a down right awful $T$ so in my opinion you should steer clear of them if you want a decent laptop .\n- We usually just get some of the dinner specials and they are very reasonably $T$ and very tasty .\n- After the $T$ came , we did n't see our waiter for at least 40 MINUTES !\n- Build a $T$ with side orders like Amazin ' Greens salads , Buffalo Chicken Kickers and Cinna Stix .\n- Meat-phobes are in luck with the extraordinary veggie burger , made from a distinctive blend of chickpeas , $T$ and other vegetables and spices .\n- delicious simple $T$ in nice outdoor atmosphere .\n- I have to say that if this what makes it easier to get a saet a $T$ - I dont mind .\n- I run Dreamweaver , $T$ , Photoshop , Safari , Firefox , MSN Messenger and a few other applications constantly at the same time .\n- '' The $T$ includes pub fare -- burgers , steaks and shepherds pie -- and even a portabella lasagna for those black sheep known as `` vegetarians .\n- My MacBook Pro $T$ like a dream , it has never overheated , or even been slightly warm for that matter .\n- Not only did they have amazing , sandwiches , soup , $T$ etc , but their homemade sorbets are out of this world !\n- $ 160 for 2 filets , 2 sides , an appetizer and $T$ .\n- The restaurant looks out over beautiful green $T$ to the Hudson River and the Statue of Liberty .\n- It is far more popular as a bar than as a restaurant , with only a few tables and the waiter being the $T$ , but we greatly enjoyed the unobtrusive atmosphere .\n- Great service , great $T$ .\n- My ONLY issues are : 1 -RRB- the screen/video resolution wo n't increase to a higher $T$ then 1024 x 6Negative\n- It may be a bit $T$ on weekends , but the vibe is good and it is the best French food you will find in the area .\n- I 've installed to it additional $T$ and 16Gb RAM .\n- Definitely try the $T$ - it was incredible .\n- also it comes with very useful $T$ like iphoto that it is the best photo application i have ever had\n- The white bean brushetta to start was incredible and the $T$ was phenomenal .\n- It is VERY easy to type on and feels great - besides the added feature that the $T$ is lighted .\n- Speedy delivers , great $T$ , decent prices , and friendly service combine to ensure an enjoyable repast .\n- Meat-phobes are in luck with the extraordinary veggie burger , made from a distinctive blend of chickpeas , carrots and other vegetables and $T$ .\n- My only gripe would be the need to add more $T$ .\n- The $T$ are more appealing then stuffy overpriced French restaurants .\n- The $T$ that comes with the computer is so simple to use and produces a great finished product .\n- The $T$ that I ordered was as thin as water and aside from the poorly fried tofu that I ordered in it , they graciously provided me with ONE piece of poorly cooked potato .\n\n英語で5-10単語程度で、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない主要な違いを簡潔に回答してください。\n\n回答：\n",
