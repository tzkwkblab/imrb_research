      "UPDATE - EVERY positive review has little hours played, also the hours after review are none. Proving that the game is stale. Proving that the game is a gimmick and people are thumb upping in hopes of a good game.\n\nThis game is trash.\n\nTo the guy making fun of me pointing out that there are more hours played after posting my review, NOW WHAT BICH?? I DON'T PLAY THIS TRASH, WHY? BECAUSE IT IS A CRAP GAME , what you got to say now huh boy?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOriginal review -\n\nWOW, you can sell incomplete crap like this, really?\n\nOK: 3 levels.... and level 4 comes at the end of the year.\nI'm leveling a character... for what??\n\n\nto all you thumb uppers.... I'm asking- I'm leveling a character for what? How dare you thumbs up. I got fooled and thought this is good, now I feel robbed.\n\nDo you want to feel robbed??????\nIt doesn't feel good....\n\nThere are only 3 short levels.....\nWhat kind of rpg is 3 levels?\n\n\nI think something needs to be done to clean up scum like this. This, donate me crap..... needs to go on kickstarter, gofundme, not on the steam marketplace. Because you showed yourself as a real game, but what did I really buy? Level 4 comes out in 1 year.... I'll tell you 10 levels wouldn't nearly be enough!!!\n\nTHE NEXT LEVEL, LEVEL 4 COMES OUT AT THE END s\\OF THE YEAR- 10 LEVELS WOULD NOT NEARLY BE ENOUGH TO MAKE THIS A GAME! WHAT AM I GRINDING FOR, LEVELING WHAT FOR WHAT???? U THIEVES!!!!!\n\n-UPDATE - Beat elite mode on first time trying, beat nightmare mode on second time trying. Game is nothing, no voice actors, no real point in the game, and stupid broken mechanics. Get all psyched about scrolls and ascension to build a nice character? Then realize how broken the 20k damage per shot is, there really isn't any fine tuning in the game. The game has NO CONTENT- WOW 4 LEVELS AND a CAMPAIGN FOR \"FULL RELEASE\" I WILL REMEMBER THIS DEVELOPER AND BE WARY!!!\n\nDO NOT BUY\n\nDO NOT BUY\nDO NOT BUY\n\nDO NOT SUPPORT\n\nDO NOT BUY\n\nIF YOU THUMBS UP- YOU HAVE BEEN FOOLED! OPEN YOUR EYES TO THE RATE OF RELEASES - WHAT IS ACTUALLY RELEASED- NO VOICE ACTORS- BROKEN MATH FOR THE GAME SYSTEM- \nTHIS WAS ADVERTISED AS LIKE BORDERLANDS- IT IS NOT EVEN %1 OF THE CONTENT OF BORDERLANDS FOR %50 OF THE PRICE OF BORDERLANDS 3!!!\n\nThis game is $10, peoples' stupid thumb up reviews saying to buy this if it's on sale.....\n\nBORDERLANDS 3 IS $20 WTH DID YOU SUGGEST ME TO BUY YOU IDIOTS!!! \n\n3 levels- with level 4 at the end of the year and labeled as full release- stupid.",
      "And I PRE ORDERED this hahahhhahah",
      "Disclaimer: This is review from player who prefer story-rich game and haven't played any game by Arkhouse Telegraph.\n\nThe good:\n+ Outstanding 80's-esque visual pixel artstyle. It reminds me of few SNES/Atari/Gameboy games.\n+ Fairly good soundtrack.\n+ Some cutscene/area have fascinating atmosphere.\n+ Run well with Steam proton, so it's likely this game is playable for Linux/Steam Deck user. Although the platformer area might show too many small detail for 7\" display.\n+ Game OST/artbook is available for free on Arkhouse website.\n\nThe bad:\n- While i understand nature of this game require player to find out most thing and go through trial-and-error, some parts definitely need to be explained better. I refer to lack of autosave (for most part of the game), not letting player know about manual save (you can do it by head left after exit for cylinder elevator until you see display/sign \"< S\" and suggestion to visit block H (where you get some guidance).\n- While the manual say i can play R. U. N. E. 3000 first, i have hard time understanding the story and lore/world building. Conversation such as \"DO? DORODO!\" is mostly gibberish and i only can make vague guess based on few specific term (\"V2\", \"50/50\", etc.) and area i've visited. Short recap of previous games (even it's on the manual) could be really helpful for newcomers.\n\nThe ugly:\n* I experience a bug where i fight boss i'm not supposed to fight yet. In detail, [spoiler] after i exit from P block to get symbol cracking code, i was thrown to G block where i fight G-Cat/10th boss. The worst part is the boss HP bar started with red color and auto 3-60 cannon never perform attack. Fortunately the bug doesn't occur again after i load from manual save.  [/spoiler].\n* The gameplay variation/idea is very interesting, but the execution is mixed bags (more explanation on below paragraph)\n\nSaturn Quest: R. U. N. E. 3000 has lots of gameplay variant/modes (Adventure, Shoot'em up, Platformer and many more) to keep the game fresh. While each area/boss have different reason why it's challenging/difficult, many of those is very unbalanced. For example, [spoiler] Bioplatus M-3D/6th boss [/spoiler] require you to have extraordinary eye-hand coordination and multitasking skill. Among all enemy that resemble boss fight, i only managed to beat 6-7 boss without using cheat.\n\nThis game also has very few checkpoint on each area/boss. On adventure/platformer area, you could restart from beginning after spending 10-20 minutes where you have to avoid same trap or collect same item again. On boss fight, that means you'll need to repeat whole fight most of the time. It's could be annoying because since you're forced to find out boss behavior the hard way or repeating tedious part of the fight.\n\n3 HP and lack of difficulty option could be irritating for most modern player. There are time when i found out i only lose 3-10 HP when i use cheat and beat the boss. If there's easier difficulty where i have 6-10 HP, i could beat more boss by myself. But don't get me wrong, i feel really satisfied each time i beat boss (which i deemed can be beaten with practical amount of effort) without cheat. If the developer bother add easy difficulty which has higher player HP, give more Nana and slightly lower boss HP, far more people could enjoy this unique piece of artwork.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nWhile i have some rant, it's really unique experience even though i've played few hundred games. In overall, i have more positive sentiment than negative sentiment of this game. But even though i choose \"Yes\" when Steam ask \"Do you recommend this game?\", i'd rather choose \"Neutral\" or \"Information\" instead. If you're fan of 80's game or really like difficult game, you might come to like this game. But for most people, i'd recommend you to seek other game. Although if you really insist to play this game, you could use Cheat Engine and modify HP/Nana using value type Double (also called float64 or 8-byte float).\n\nP.S. I definitely will play the sequel (Episode IV-VI: White Meteor Saga according to the artbook) [b]IF[/b] the developer bother add easy difficulty option and more checkpoint during boss fight/exploration.",
      "I've been completely in love with this game ever since the Mojam prototype \"Wasteland Kings\" was released. It's an insanely fun, fastpaced \"roguelike-like\" or \"roguelite\" with randomly generated worlds and tons of weapons to find. On top of that, the developers stream the development of the game on tuesdays and thursdays over at Twitch and they release updates to the game every week. To me, this is the best game of its kind and I've put tons of hours into mastering it (and I still die. Often. It's difficult okay?).",
      "Little over three hours in; Familar puzzles are back, traps are back, backtracking and exploring (in a fun way) is back, trying not to shit yourself while you run through a hallway to conserve ammo as several giant things try to kill you is back, ridiculous humor mixed with gameplay is back, classic Resident Evil storytelling is back...\n\nWelcome Back Resident Evil, you were missed.\n\nEdit: I cheered at the end, and almost woke my wife and son up at six in the morning. I'm glad I avoided the spoilers. \n\nWelcome back [Redacted] and [Redacted], I'll be waiting for the free DLC.",
      "I have played OSU!, Muse Dash and stepmania plenty and I gotta say that this does not feel like a rhythm game at all. The premise of matching the shape of the map to music sounds interesting but some of the songs I feel like are not mapped out correctly. Or in general this game relies less on music cues and more on visual cues? It felt like maps are only 50% related to the song and you have to ignore what you hear because the map randomly demands patterns that have no matching audio equivalent and everything becomes pure visual memorization.",
      "Hoooh boy, this game sneaks up on you! It seems like any other chill little puzzle game at first. You're enjoying how it tickles the logical part of your brain and maybe even start to feel a little cocky after you've understood the mechanics, like you've outsmarted the game because you've figured out where the enemies are and beat the king for the first time... \n\n...and suddenly it's past midnight. You just nuked every enemy on the map with one attack, jumping in and out of the shadows on a pacifist run or chaining perfectly planned combos for zero energy while thinking \"just one more round, I was so close to getting the king on the highest difficulty!!\"\n\nThe music is well balanced to keep it exciting while not ruining your focus.\nThe art has a handcrafted quality, is easy on the eyes and is cute (even as the enemies turn to skeletons!).\nThe gameplay is easy to get into even for a dumb-dumb like me. It's fun but challenging and I find myself coming back for more even after clearing it all!\n\nOver all, I give this game a 2.75 out of 2.8! (My cat came up with the scoring system, please don't tease him he is very self-conscious about it).",
      "I played the F*CK out of RE4 back in the day.. I was sooo hyped for this but its just not RE4.. I get it's a remake but it's not a good one. Which sucks because I LOVED the RE2 remake.. Idk. Maybe it's just me but I cannot recommend this if you loved the original. Maybe newcomers will like it.\n\nEdit after 18 more hours: the original is still better but this remake is not bad. I can recommend it.",

      "Volition ups the silly, and adds super powers, but loses a little something along the way.\n\nI loved Saint's Row: the Third, and by all rights should have loved IV as well, but I mostly just liked it. The set up was fun, and seemed to up the ante again, but then you get the presidency ripped away from you almost immediately (without even seeing the consequences of your first pushed legislation!). Placing the game in a virtual city for the most part with the only real characters being on your space ship, really kinda seemed to gut the game. Even when [spoiler]the world gets destroyed[/spoiler], a detached, \"meh\" was all I could muster. The humor is there, but it's mostly better in the DLC. The radio stations feel kind of underwhelming without DJs.\n\nFinally all the fun of collecting and customizing various interesting cars, and finding ways to climb or fall to interesting places with a stolen plane/parachute are gutted with the inclusion of super powers. Also, the super powers make gunplay, leveling any of your other stuff, and pretty much every mechanic carried over from Saints Row: the Third obsolete.\n\nIf you get this game, do yourself a favor and make sure you get all the DLC where most of the real fun is. Is it as good as the previous Saints Row? I don't think so, but I still recommend getting it and playing through it. It is a lot of fun, and I love the 50's break out scenario at the beginning.\n\nStacey's thoughts:\nStill awaiting DLC with Jane Austin and the D*ldo Bat.

      "Katana ZERO? More like, Katana ZERO CONCLUSION.\n\nI had too high expectation on this game, I thought it was going to be Hotline Miami but better.\nIn the end I still prefer Hotline Miami, specifically Hotline Miami 2.\n\nOne thing I dislike is the lack of combo scoring system. \nIt's a good way to make the players act fast and execute their actions flawlessly, instead the game only has a timer bar that never runs out as a way to motivate the player to go fast.\n\nI am aware how \"pointless\" game scores are.\nBut seeing a number going up feels good.\n\nWhat happens when you kill an enemy in Hotline Miami?\n - You get to see a number pops out, and the score goes up indicating that you are doing good!\n - Satisfying bloody hit sound.\n - Throbbing light on the edge of the map.\n - Randomized dead sprite of the enemy, sometimes they get dismembered depending on the weapon.\n\nIn Katana ZERO you'd get :\n - A \"fwoob\" sound.\n - A same dying animation of the enemy getting knocked and bleed to death. Instead of getting decapitated or something.\n - Flashy slash effect.\n\nAt one point I wondered on why should I even bother killing the enemies when it didn't reward me with anything in the room with a minecart. \nWhen having the enemy being killed by the minecart or the player makes no difference.\n\n[spoiler]More like Katana ZERO REWARD. I think this is it, exactly why I am disappointed by it. Imagine playing soulsbornekiro or Hollow Knight without earning any kind of currency??? Killing the enemies would feel pointless.[/spoiler]\n\nIt's basically way more fun and rewarding to kill an enemy in Hotline Miami than Katana ZERO.\n\nThen there are other stuff like...\nUnfun stealth gameplay. \nRollspamming without consequence.\nBeing able to endlessly doing a mid air attack without having to touch the ground first.\n\nThere are also waaaay too many checkpoints in my opinion, it encouraged me to just brute force everything with roll spamming without having to worry about starting over.\nThe rooms could've been a bit bigger and longer. But also less room, quality over quantity.\n\nAnd finally, the story.\nI was intrigued by it but it just ended abruptly with a \"To be continued\".\nIt's like they only wrote 50% of it then slapped a \"To be continued\" and called it a day.\nThe game seems to rely heavily on \"mentioning stuff off screen that player will never get to see\" to tease the player.\nI already knew that the game is going to be short, but I didn't expect it to be this disappointing. \n\nIt's not a bad game, I just had the wrong expectation.\n\nI might change it to positive if I was satisfied by the DLC.\nOr maybe after beating the hard mode, I heard it's more fun.",
      "The latest S tier Deckbuilder Roguelike, joining the ranks of Slay the Spire and Monster Train for me. I think that's all that really needs to be said.\n\nIt leans heavily into kiss/curse type effects, if you like the ability to manipulate rng and do some busted stuff with your sequencing you will love it. It is more of a thinker on a turn to turn basis than other games of this genre, but if that isn't a turn off then it's a really solid game with some unique characters/mechanics that feel fresh.",
      "Ok to make it short.\n\n- Poor graphics (like 10 years old PC game)\nBUT nothing more to complain about.\n\n- great atmosphere, great story, very good fighting mechanics. Of course great price.\n\nIf you have nothing against japan style - just play the game. One of funniest games in some years for me.",
      "Ratchet & Clank is always fun. The older games are clearly better, as it feels like the more modern they get, the shallower and simpler they become. They now feel almost like a demo of a game - you just get to dip your toe into each of the systems, never really fully engaging with any of them. New abilities are just thrown at you with no fanfare, and then you only need them 3 times, and it never asks you to combine them in new ways. Everything feels underwhelming and tossed aside shortly after being introduced. That's almost the theme of the game - they even have Ratchet meeting a fellow Lombax for the first time ever, the thing he has been focused on since game 1, and it's pretty much just \"hi, let's go do the next thing.\" The series has been casualized, just as neutered as their formerly innuendo-laden titles. \n\nBut it's still fun to play, it's just lacking the magic it used to have.",
      "very complicated game and the tutorial is good at explaining the high level concepts but you will struggle with basic things like 'how do i get more gold'. \n\nfurther it may take a while to get into the game. for example i found it very hard - but i realised it was trying to do too much in a single lifetime and instead needed to focus on the long game while roleplaying each character. In that regard crusader kings 3 is different to other stratagy games like total war or stellaris - which encourage you to snowball the map. At the moment it doesn't seem that straightforward.\n\nthere are a few AI quirks in particular with combat - i've seen enemies embark/dissembark troops for years which should be costing them gold each time they embark.",
      "Do yourself a favor.  Go in as blind as possible.  Don't look at any guides.  The system of getting pages of the manual that you can't fully understand is a stroke of genius.\n\nAlso I haven't found a waterfall that *doesn't* have a secret behind it.\n\n**EDIT: Finished the game**\n\nI'll admit for many of the later \"post-game puzzles\" I looked at a guide for.  The in game language is very difficult to decipher blindly, and if you're not familiar with English you probably shouldn't even bother.  \n\nThe surprising thing about this game is you can pretty much do any puzzle at any given time once you get one or two specific items, but because of how the manual is handled, you'll never know how until you see the pages (or experiment a lot)\n\nI think the most amount of tries I've spent on a boss fight was 7-8, but nothing is stopping you from exploring more and finding stat boosts.",
      "What can I say that hasn't been said and that you don't know.\nThis game is IN-SANE.\nThe attention to detail is mind-boggling, the missions, from the smallest to all the main missions are worthy of oscars.\nThe single player campaign is one of the best adventures I ever went on in my life. This is why I love games.\nThe beauty of this game in indescribable. It's one of most realistic living worlds I've ever been in.\nIn fact, it felt so real to me, that I would spend hours living and breathing the game, I felt I was there, at that time.\nTaking care of my horse, spending time fishing and hunting, sometimes for hours.\nRiding my horse in strong winds, and heavy rain, collecting every piece of clothing and trying to look dashing at all times.\nI got attached to people, took care of them, or dragged them behind my horse when I wasn't in the mood for their BS.\nI've been there. I lived there. That was me, I was a cowboy. Nobody will convince me otherwise.",
      "Ok, so... one of my favourite films of my childhood. HOWEVER; not being able to start in SANDBOX mode from the start almost INSTANTLY put me off this title, I mean, really? So you have to complete the in-game island tasks/missions (***)*)*)*)*). And after only 4 hours of play through.... \n\nSPOILER ALERT: Dinosaurs escape their enclosures!! ALL THE TIME, its frankly trying to emulate the movie (Jurassic Park 1) as where the DIno's always escape and again SPOILER ALERT: THE INTROS TO EVERY PART OF THE GAME BASICALLY TELL YOU THIS IS DEFO GOING TO HAPPEN.\n\nTo conclude:\n\n1) There is a heavy lean on the movies (I personally don't think that's bad)\n2) It offers a SANDBOX within the opening screen however then informs this is blocked (WHICH IS ANNOYING) until certain missions have been completed.\n3)  DINOSAURS ESCAPE CONSTANTLY\n4) DINOSAURS ESCAPE CONSTANTLY\n5) The game is more interested in visuals rather than content",

      "Playing this game instantly brought back memories of me playing TMNT, Battletoads, Double Dragon, and Streets of Rage, with my little brother on the NES and Sega Genesis in the early 90s. Luckily this game doesn’t feature TMNT’s ridiculous water level or Battletoads' sadistic peed bike level. The graphics are perfect, the controls are great, the soundtrack is awesome (especially the Wu-Tang stage, and the Shredder stage), and the levels and overworld map are fun to navigate. I’ve played through the story mode with all 7 characters and have played through the arcade mode multiple times solo and many times in multiplayer and I’ve enjoyed every bit of it. This game is so much fun.\n\nThere are a few things I wish existed though. I wish there were more playable characters. I wish that you did not lose your 7 character’s progress in story mode when you start a new game. I wish you could see the difficulty level of the online arcade game you are joining. I wish there were cumulative stats you could see for arcade and story mode that showed the number of times you completed a stage, how many enemies you knocked out, objects you’ve destroyed, stage times, combo streaks, times taunted, etc. I wish you could create your own turtle and assigned moves, specials, jumps, taunts, and colors.",
      "Her story starts you off in an old looking computer with what looks like Windows 95, or perhaps a previous version. Once there you are presented with a database of footage from a 1990s, where you must piece together what happened.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\nWithout spoiling anything, since this game is all story based, you are revisiting video clips of seven separate interviews trying to piece together what exactly happened. When you start off, you are placed in front the pc with the word “murder” already typed in. With this simple word, you are given, you must, delve deeper into the story, and form your own conclusion as to what happened, but the more you go deeper into the mystery, the more confused you may become; perhaps even discarding your previous assumption many times before coming to a conclusion that does not go against her story.    \n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nThis game is not a conventional game in terms of gameplay. Instead, you are watching videos and finding potential terms that could lead you to more videos which will reveal more as to her past and what, and who was involved in this incident. Some might not like this, so if the idea of an exclusively story based game does not appeal, do not bother. It is an interesting concept, and very captivating if you play it without any distractions, perhaps more interesting if you play it with a friend and try to piece the mystery together (much like I did).\n\n[h1]Verdict: 8.5/10[/h1]\n\nIf you enjoyed this review, or found it helpful, please feel free to follow our curator [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/WeLoveKawaiiNekos#curation]here.[/url]",
      "I'll lay it out. If you're really interested in the hacking mechanic, that might be sufficient reason to play this game. Otherwise, I'd be inclined to give it a miss.\n\nFrom a gameplay perspective, there's not really much to hook a new player. There's a long period at the start where you're expected to randomly interact with people, but given no reason why you should do so. The whole socializing and partying thing isn't intuitive unless you're a person who'd normally be into that, and there's little in the game that pushes you in that direction. As a result, progressing as far as the story actually starting is often the result of accident at best. It took me 4 hours of just wandering around, not knowing what I was supposed to be doing or why.\n\nOnce you're able to program there's a bit more direction and less frustration, but you're still not given much reason for doing it until later on.\n\nAll in all, stick around if you're really invested in getting to the programming. Otherwise, it's an exercise in frustration and shallow conversations that's not really a lot of fun.\n\nArt's gorgeous though, so the game has that going for it at least.",
      "So, I only found this game because my favorite Vtuber Miilkywayz on Twitch played it. It seemed pretty interesting but when she started making her own cards. As an IRL witch I was WAY more interested. The game itself is great, I love making cards and learning their meanings and seeing how how the story changes changes based on your deck and the cards drawn. And the replaybility of it is amazing given its price. 10/10 from me. Need more games like this.",
      "Uncharted 4: A Thief's End:\n\nThe ambitious end to a long running franchise, Uncharted 4: A Thief's End is a very fascinating game.\nThe gunplay is enjoyable, the puzzles are decent and the humor is pretty good, there are some hilarious character interactions.\n\nThe story though, isn't very deep but I liked the darker approach and the flashbacks, it's interesting enough to keep you playing, and it really makes you care for the characters.\n\nExploration works decently, but it could've been better, there are documents you can read or find collectibles. The open area in Madagascar was one of the best parts of the game in my opinion, the car handles very well and the driving feels phenomenal.\n\nLastly, climbing is a very big part of the game, and even though the climbing mechanics are very smooth, I really had to force myself to enjoy it some times, and I wish there was less of it.\n\nThe action sequences are easily the best thing about this game, some jaw-dropping set-pieces keep you on the edge of your seat.\n\nUncharted 4 is the definition of a \"Movie Videogame\".\nIt's absolutely gorgeous, the cinematography is outstanding, the performances are fantastic and the soundtrack fits well, but gameplay-wise it's just... exhausting, not because of the controls or the gunplay, but because of the hand-holding and the linearity.\n\nUncharted the Lost Legacy:\n\nUncharted the Lost Legacy is proof that Uncharted can great even without Nathan Drake. The Lost Legacy is essentially just more Uncharted 4, it's something like a stand-alone expansion, and a good one at that.\n\nHonestly, I am surprised, I enjoyed this more than I expected. Even though the gameplay is more of the same, there's less climbing, and the fact that the game is relatively short is mostly a positive.\n\nThe game rarely feels repetitive, every puzzle is different from each other, and there is also an open area in the middle of the game where you can explore, which was implemented very well.\n\nAs for Chloe and Nadine, they make a pretty nice duo, where's Chloe is likeable and a goofball, Nadine is the opposite, she's aggressive and focuses on her mission. I liked their chemistry and I think both characters work very well together.\n\nAnd now for the negatives, the story isn't necessarily bad, it's just very generic and there are no stakes. Also, in my personal opinion, the biggest flaw the game has is that there are barely any highlights in it, almost no action except from the last chapter, which is a complete letdown considering how the action is literally the best part about this series.\n\nOverall it's very solid, and for its size it's definitely worth checking out, a great stand-alone expansion.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThank you Sony! Both games runs surprisingly well and overall very fun games. Uncharted 2 is still my favorite tho, but i'm happy to see Uncharted 4 and the Lost Legacy finally on PC, Uncharted 1,2,3 when?",
      "This does what I wish AAA RPGs with narratives would do; choices actually feel like they make an impact and the gameplay changes that reflect this are dynamic in nature and provide meaningful differences in the conversations.\n\nIt doesn't feel this way on a macro scale, the meaning is more in the individual encounters with some exceptions. To word it a little differently, I felt like my choices had very little impact on the story as a whole and I could easily (a little too easily) steer the final outcome at any time but, within individual interrogations, what I chose to do had a major affect on the immediate narrative.\n\nThat being said, it is a wonderful game to play for four to six hours on a Sunday and at $15 USD it is cheap and entertaining enough to only need a single playthrough to feel like you've gotten your money's worth. Although I haven't started my second playthrough, I'm already thinking about when I want to sit down and have another go.",

      "Hello Charlotte is not a game; it is a confessional.\nIf you're here you've probably already realized, but I wish to place massive emphasis that Hello Charlotte, and Hello Charlotte 3 especially, has very little gameplay, and what is present is very standard RPGMaker fare. If you are the kind to balk at visual novels, HC3 will not be your cup of tea. Watch a playthrough or something if you're interested, but don't expect any kind of engaging play.\nWith that said: Hello Charlotte 3 (and its DLC, Heaven's Gate) has been one of the most emotional, impactful pieces of art I've ever engaged with. It is horrifically honest, incorrigibly vulnerable, and, as previously stated-- more a confessional than a game. With everything I know how to say and with everything I have to say about it, I cannot find a way to truly articulate what Hello Charlotte made me feel (still makes me feel) and how it has affected me.\n\nHello Charlotte: Childhood's End is from the perspective not of the Charlotte of the previous two games, but a new, blank slate PC. While not necessary to play the previous two games, I strongly recommend it. It develops on the themes of the previous two games, and in doing so, completely recontextualizes them. C and Anri of HC2 return, as does Scarlett, though not in the forms we are accustomed to. We are finally given a full understanding on the nature of Charlotte and the False Realm, and what we are in relation to it.\netherane's art has markedly improved since the second game, with impressive sprite and background artwork, though their style is still recognizable. The music (some composed by etherane, others outsourced) is varied and distinctive. Most prominent about etherane's work, however, are the themes and writing, which have matured considerably since the release of HC2. Though often garish and on the nose, HC3 is a poignant commentary on the nature of art and fiction, the impact we have on one another, and our understanding of realness itself.\nYou will experience confusion. You will experience whiplash. The game intends to make you unsure and uncomfortable in its consumption, <i>deliberately</i> so. In the process it becomes a jarring, distinctive work of art unique to its creator and an important representation of the Millenial psyche. It's a psychological horror game and by God will it force you to experience psychological horror.",
      "Oh boy. DoDonPachi Resurrection.\nI love this game. Its loads of modes, tight controls, great bullet patterns, and fun gameplay and scoring mechanics make it an awesome shooter. \nThat being said, this game is tough as nails. Even the novice mode is hard as heck and definitely isn't novice-friendly. I reccomend having one or two shmup clears under your belt before you try to tackle DoDonPachi. (Crimzon Clover's novice mode is a good introduction to shmupping) You need some skill to get the maximum amount of enjoyment out of this game.\n\nStill, though, It's awesome! DoDonPachi Resurrection is a very fun experience, even with it's difficulty.\n",
      "I have been a big fan of the Halo series since CE so I may be a bit biased but yea.\n\nPositives\n- Good campaign\n- Fun coop\n- Good story\n- Good mechanics\n- Graphics are good\n- Good price, honestly don't wouldn't even wait for it to go on sale\n\nCons\n- I have noticed a sound delay every now and again\n- A few graphical glitches every now and again, not really regular\n- The fact they exchanged the original Halo Reach XP and levelling system with \"seasons\" \n     - Can no longer just buy what you want, you need to play 4 million mp matches just to \n       unlock the helmet you want then repeat that for the matching chest piece in the next \n       season\n     - Can no longer get experience from the campaign (Edit: This has since been updated so \n       you can ear medals from campaign but you still can't directly earn xp) \n     - The maximum experience able to be collected is to low for the later levels. I think the max \n        should be lifted fro everyone, or slowly go up depending on what level you are\n- How long it takes to level up is just stupid. It was good for the first few levels then it feels like there is a massive jump in time.\n- A few audio glitches here and then. (For me anyway you need to be facing the sound to hear it, even if its over comms\n\nI love the game and would honestly recommend it but think a few things could be changed in my personal opinion.",
      "With almost 300 hours of Destiny 2 (D2) back on Battle.net (the Blizzard launcher), let me give this perspective/advice for new players, specifically with regards for the F2P offering that is Destiny 2: New Light, with a few more holistic thoughts sprinkled throughout:\n\nThis overall game is very good. It doesn't always live up to its promise (the first mission of every campaign is always the most polished thing aside from the raids/dungeons), but when it does, it [b]really[/b] shines.\n\nThe gunplay is unrivaled. The visual/audio feedback is great, the handling feels really good, and enemies really pop when you take them out. Expect nothing less from the studio that brought us grunt birthday parties.\n\nThe game is better in a fireteam. Now that the base game is F2P [though with considerably less content than it used to be/I would like], this should be easier than ever for most activities. That said, a huge majority of my playtime was done solo. It can get tricky at times (\"Darkness Zones\" in certain missions prevent respawning but allow for revives, so solo players have a distinct disadvantage there). \n\nWith that said, dungeons (currently 'The Shattered Throne', 'Pit of Heresy', 'Prophecy' which is free to all players, 'Grasp of Avarice', 'Duality', and 'Spire of the Watcher') and raids (\"Last Wish\" from Forsaken, \"Garden of Salvation\" from Shadowkeep, \"The Deep Stone Crypt\" from Beyond Light, 'Vow of the Disciple' from Witch Queen, as well as 'Vault of Glass' and 'King's Fall' from D1 - both of which are both free to all players) are best experienced with a team, so don't shy away from LFG group-finder options like the Discord, official app, or any number of other sites (just make sure to accurately describe your experience, level, and gear. 'Tis only polite). \n\nOf the matchmade multiplayer offerings, I enjoy Gambit (PvPvE, reminds me of the Black Ops Zombies 4z4 mode done right), jump into the occasional Strike (PvE, matchmade fireteams running campaign-like missions), and have no interest in Crucible (PvP, it's fine I guess, but I've never liked PvP that's dependent in large part on personal progression - especially in the competitive modes like Trials of Osiris and Iron Banner)\n\nDon't be afraid to ignore content - this is absolutely the kind of game where you can set your own goals. Want a specific exotic gun? Look up where it drops and focus on grinding that content. Want a specific roll on a random roll gun? Find the best possible farming (or crafting) method and go to town. Chase down some of the exotic questions that the game clutters up your quest page with, or just goof around doing things that you find fun while absolutely ignoring all signposts.\n\nSome stuff just won't be explained in game. It's not as bad as Warframe (much less need for a wiki) but some things are still obscured. Feel free to look up Xur (exotic weapon vendor who visits on weekends) and other hidden exotics tied to specific activities, lost sectors, patrol locations, or quest chains.\n\nFor anything that you can't easily find online - reach out and find a sherpa. The community for this game tends to be pretty great, and enough of us have spent enough time leaning specific parts of it (e.g. raids) or just mechanics in general (\"What are random rolls? Which do I keep?\") that we'd be happy to jump onto discord (there are a bunch for PC, just check out the subreddit sidebar linked below) and answer any and all questions you may have. \n\nThe fact that a representative chunk of this game is free makes this the perfect time to dip your toes in without emptying out your wallet. Any other questions about this game as a product (\"Should I pay for DLC? Is Eververse worth it?\") should absolutely be researched elsewhere.\n\nIf you're looking for a place to start with the F2P content, finish the intro missions in the Cosmodrome. New and returning players are semi-regularly upgraded to a new light level floor, but means that you can miss out on the \"learning the ropes\" parts of the game that come with working your way through the New Light quest chain or unlocking different subclasses. [As of Beyond Light, all of the campaign content through Forsaken are not currently accessible. Release order was Red War (launch campaign) > Forsaken > Shadowkeep > Beyond Light > Witch Queen, followed by the upcoming expansions Lightfall > Final Shape.]\n\nEyes up, guardian.\n\nFootnotes for people yelling at me in the comments:\n-All of this is my opinion. Feel free to hold your own and disagree with mine.\n-I generally enjoy grinding, looter shooters, FPS's, and weird sci-fi space magic. Halo, Borderlands, Warframe, and CoD Zombies are some of my most-played and favorite games.\n-As far as I can tell, anything that is not strictly subjective in the above is factually correct [as of Season of Plunder, with updates noted throughout. This game changes quite a bit over time, so make sure to do your own research before spending money on it]. If I've missed something, feel free to point it out in the comments and I'll do my best to update this periodically. \n-This review previously made mention of both content vaulting and weapon sunsetting. These practices have both been discontinued as of Season of Plunder. However, it is not clear at this if or when power capped or vaulted may return/be uncapped, if ever.\n\n-----------------\nTL:DR: It's good. Not perfect, but really good. And since it's free, you can get a really good sense of if this game is for you without paying for any of it. You can play almost any activity solo pretty easily except for a handful of endgame activities. If you're overwhelmed at first, just play through the Cosmodrome missions while you get your feet under you, or ask a veteran player for help.\n-----------------\n\nSites to use (List was compiled at Shadowkeep launch, but most of it should still be relevant/useful)\n\n    \nBeginner's Guide (Current as of Beyond Light) - https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/49007\n\nThe DTG Subreddit - /r/DestinyTheGame on Reddit - https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/\n\nDestiny Item Manager (mange your inventory from your browser even while in-game, essential to avoid unneeded trips back to the tower) - app.destinyitemmanager.com\n\nDestiny 2 Checklist (Lists out everything to do as well as when it resets in-game) - www.d2checklist.com/\n\nLight gg (Database of in-game items, useful for looking up random rolls) - https://www.light.gg/\n\nBraytech org (Lots of overlapping features, but I really like their maps) - braytech.org/\n\nDatto (Destiny Youtuber / 24:02 Raider who posts lots of useful/educational content, including exotic guides) - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkmAjbIecTIjTQctolYeuDw\n\nIf you've played D2 on another system, check out the CrossSave page (https://www.bungie.net/7/en/crosssave) on the Bungie net official site respectively to get all of your content and progression moved over to Steam.\n\nStory Recap up through Shadowkeep (Spoilers Destiny 1 / D1, and D2, obviously) (My name is Byf on YouTube: The Complete Story of Destiny!

      "Honestly I don't think I've ever cried so much over one game.  This is definitely one of the best narrative driven RPG maker games ever made - it has everything you could want.  It has beautiful art, beautiful music, wonderful narration, it's atmospheric, great characters, meaningful choices, a story of overcoming hardships similar to a real life instead of just a story, and the ending I got was beautiful! I have only played the game once but the game has a lot of different branching paths with choices really making a large difference in the game.

As it is, the game is entertaining for a couple hours, then quickly grows tiresome and frustrating. The bugs are not crippling, but taken as a whole they represent a game that is very unbalanced and grates on you over time. \n\nIf DF-9 ever hits the $5 pile, pick it up. otherwise pass.",
      "Only originally bought this to support the artist, since I'm a huge fan of his pixel art work. It's amazing, and there's a tonne of eye candy to fill your eyeballs with. However, I can't recommend this to everyone as after the first few hours it's become a bit of a chore.\n\n- The game is a \"clicker\" type with rpg/upgrade elements. It's too slow to play in the background/absent mindedly but not fast enough to keep your attention fully.\n- Each round/attempt at a boss takes way too goddamn long. \n- Barely any interaction with the world. You build tower defense style, and equip new items, but beyond that you don't have any special abilities, no \"oh shit\" once per loop power, no ability to target specific enemies, nothing. Just watch everything play out and hope your little guy doesn't get pulped.\n- Crafting/Supplying is sort of hidden away and if you don't know about dismantling you'll never grind out all the items you need to build new stuff.\n- Lore/Journal entries are hidden away and require resources to unlock using a little button on the bottom of the screen that's easy to miss. I only found it 20 hours in. The writing is cringey and obviously done by someone who probably enjoys Adam Sandler films.\n- The card system is a neat idea, but jesus christ there's too much garbage shuffling. Imagine playing MtG with a deck of 100 cards and 90 of them are lands, and everytime you get a new hand you reshuffle the whole deck so all you get is more lands. Oblivion (destroys a tile) rarely, if ever, pops up. \n- Character skills are kinda bad? You might get a good one every level (which again, takes forever) but half the time it'll be useless \"leave 10% of food/resources at camp\" when you're not doing a resource grind run.\n- So much trash equipment you have to sort through and breaks game flow.\n\nAnd the biggest \"don't recommend\" from me would be the issue with how combining tiles works. If you put two tiles beside each other they sometimes change the tiles to something else. Example - put a Vampire Mansion beside a Village and you get a town full of ghouls that after 3 loops around the map turns into an upgraded town. But you still get trash equipment from the quests it gives, and putting a Vampire Mansion beside any other type of town doesn't change that town at all. So there's no reason to experiment, and it really limits the gameplay. You'd think they'd focus on that aspect gameplay wise, especially with experimentation to get the most bonuses out of all your tiles... but no. There's a small list of things that interact with each other, and that's it.\n\nI still highly recommend it since the game is cheap, the art is amazing and the artist/indie devs should get support. But I think it's a good 2-3 major updates, expansions or fan modding away from getting really, really amazing.",
      "The Steam trailer really doesn't do this game justice.\n\nIts extremely early access right now, and the gameplay itself is nothing too spectacular (yet), but the super dynamic proximity chat is what really makes this game for me.\nHearing the muffled screams of someone getting choked out by a bug, followed shortly after by the panicked wails of another crewmember running for the life, is likely one of the funniest things I have ever experienced in a video game.\nIt truly is such a simple, yet infinitely expandable mechanic that I am really exited to see build upon in the future.\n\nPERSONAL IDEA IF THE DEVS READ THIS REVIEW:\nA monster that picks a target to stalk and follow silently. While stalking, the monster records whatever its target says, then, after it has stalked enough and kills it target, it turns from a hunter to an ambush predator.

But then, the real remaster, the Definitive Edition, you start playing the game and it FEELS like it used to feel. Like it is supposed to look. It is quite obviously way better than it used to be, but it FEELS the same.\n\nIf you ever liked playing this game, and want to play it again, this won't disappoint you. Especially with the distinct lack of RTS games in the last decade or so, this still holds true as one of the best ones.",

      "EDIT:\nRobot Entertainment has decided to dump Gameforge as the EU publisher and publish the game themselves. I would like to applaud their decision. Better late (in this case quite late) than never. However, I will not change this review to recommended for the simple fact that they shouldn't have selected that publisher in the first place. This is what ultimately ruined the EU version of the game, and it should be a good example to any other developers who consider Gameforge as their publisher (although more are more developers are duming Gameforge nowadays). I am not going to edit any of the details below since I haven't played the game after I wrote the original review, but I will most certainly consider returning to the game after the migration of the servers is complete.\n\nHere's the original review:\nPart 1:\nHow To Kill A Potentially Good Game (For Dummies):\n- Make a potentially good game.\n- Give the publishing rights to Gameforge.\n- Done!\n\nI mean, let's take a look at some of the games that Gameforge ruined:\n- Aion EU (utterly dead)\n- Tera EU (completely dead)\n- Soldier Front 2 EU (a.k.a. \"S.K.I.L.L., although the only skill you need for that game is a wallet)\n- Raiderz EU (shut down)\n- Mythos (shut down)\n- Katsuro: Path of Honor (shut down)\n- Hellbreed (shut down)\n... the list goes on ...\n\nWhy would ANYONE in their right mind allow Gameforge to publish their game?! Gameforge is known as the WORST European publisher. No one does business with them anymore and they're close to filing for bankruptcy. They already closed their location in Berlin. Why would you do that, Robot Entertainment?\n\nIt could have been a great game...\n\nPart 2:\nSince some lovely folks commented that they would REALLY (real-time executive realness) want me to review the game itself, and not its publisher, here you go:\n\nPros:\n- Great voice acting. The way they went with it (overly sarcastic) could have ended up being cringy, like the one in Wildstar, but instead, they did a good job with it.\n- Good animations. The game feels like it's polished and well executed.\n- Short queues and loading screens.\n- Interesting tower defence gameplay (as far as the Survival mode goes).\n- Character development and a crafting system.\n- Runs great on a high-end laptop.\n\nCons:\n- Poorly optimized for computers that are supposed to be able to run the game on its minimal settings.\n- Gets quite repetitive quite fast.\n- Grinding for materials can be tedious.\n- The Siege mode needs a lot of work. It is nowhere near as polished as the Survival mode.\n- The Survival mode can be too short at the early levels.\n- The developer decided to give the game to the worst publisher in Europe, and probably even the world. I mean, even EA isn't that bad anymore. I guess Gameforge could compete against Webzen for the first place.\n- You are able to buy almost everything with real cash, and if you don't want to, you better prepare for a long grind.\n- Did I mention how stupid the decision to give the publishing rights to Gameforge was? I think I did, but oh well...\n- The game is basically a cash shop oriented version of OMD! 2.\n\nThere you go! You're welcome.\n\nP.S.: Needless to say, I won't be spending a dime on this game, as long as Failforge gets a cut. I encourage everyone to do the same. Robot Entertainment might get their heads out of their... (you got the point) and change the publisher before it's too late for the game.",

People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.\n\nIt paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that \"routine\" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.\n\nI liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters.

      "I was excited to play this after playing Persona 5 and Persona 5 Royal (my introductions to the series) to death.  This game was raved about and I thought, if it's more of the same then this should be great...\n\nThe major problem I have with this game is that it's so painfully obvious that it's a game made 13 years ago.  It's not a bad game, the look and feel of the Persona series is there and the characters are interesting etc.  But at the same time whenever I played this game, I just wanted to go back and play P5R instead.  Everything is just better in P5R.  The dungeons for example, the difference is night and day.  P5R's dungeons have so much more life to them, and look so much better.  Most of the environments in this game look like dull coloured LEGO sets put together.  It looks like it was originally on a handheld console (despite the remaster).  The other major example is the voice acting.  My god, some of the voice acting in 4G is on par with some of the worst Square Enix efforts.  Audio balancing is terrible as well.  And then there's the subjective stuff.  I personally much prefer P5R's soundtrack over this one, aside from maybe a couple of songs that were cool.  The setting of Tokyo is much more interesting and dynamic than this hokey town in the middle of nowhere.  The characters themselves I found much more engaging in 5R.  This was particularly helped by the quality of voice acting.  I think \n\nI'm glad that people are able to experience this game again on a more available platform.  I think potentially if I had played this back when it was released, I would probably have a different opinion of this game.  If you like Persona games and can look beyond what's dated badly, then the core game is very much the same.  If you were a fan already, this is a quality refresh to the game.  However, if you're like me and experienced the future of this series before playing this, I dont recommend it.  P5R provides the same gameplay but adds so much more.  It's a shame we cannot get that game on Steam instead.",

      "Firstly, neutral reviews should be a thing. Because although the game's story is pretty solid (and some elements of it still very relavant even today), the game suffers from a multitude of issues, so no, I don't truly recommend this game because of those factors. Rockstar themselves should be fixing the broken state of the game, instead of leaving it to people to fix it.\n\nThe problem with this game is that you need to be online to be even able to play it. You NEED to be online to PLAY a SINGLEPLAYER game FROM 2009. I don't know what Rockstar was thinking when they force you to play online, but this is just not okay. There is no online functionality for the game besides maybe cloud saves - something steam cloud could've done just as fine instead of leaving it to their own messy launcher.\n\nBut that's not the only problem with this game. Being that it's an old game, it does not run well on modern systems, not anymore. It suffers from various performance issues. Thankfully, you can use DXVK to get around this problem - but as i said earlier, you shouldnt HAVE TO do this. Rockstar could have easily patched the game to fix the performance issues (that still happen with DXVK mind you - but compared to without DXVK it is MUCH better), instead they focused on patching who knows what.\n\nExcept after you use DXVK, you HAVE to edit a game file to let the game use more than 2 gb of ram. Again, SOMETHING Rockstar could've easily done by updating the game's code to meet the modern standards. Nobody has specs like the one in the minimum recommend anymore. After you do that, you HAVE to edit the amount of vram the game detects by using a command line to fix it. That's already 3 things you have to deal with JUST to be even able to play the game normally.\n\nSome people may see this as a small botherance - some people may see it as a huge inconvenience, but the apparent problem with this is that, once again, you SHOULDNT HAVE TO do all of this. Going past those issues and playing the game, you also have to ensure you limit the fps to 60, either using DXVK or the in game vsync (former being more recommendable as it doesn't hog as much as cpu power). If you decided to bother with all of those steps to make the game playable, congratulations. Now be severely annoyed like I did  because Rockstar has not, for all this time, patched the final mission with the helicopter QTE. One suggested fix for it was to limit the FPS to 60 - which did NOT help me. Other was to install a script file to fix it, which ALSO failed at first, till I tried again like 5-6 times. You as a player should not have to install this stuff and edit games just to fix the game, when the publisher themselves should be doing it. I expect a game to be supported if it's still being sold on Steam. And don't think they don't care about the games being on Steam - they clearly cared when they removed the classic gta trilogy from Steam (which were also left in even more of a broken state compared to how they first came out - but that is an entirely different point).\n\nPutting all of those factors aside, the game itself is very solid, story wise. I really loved all of the symbolism that was apparent throught the game, and concepts such as \"American Dream\" or \"Land of Oppurtunity\" being presented as something that was clearly flawed - which is precisely why people like Nico go down the path of killing people or doing drugs just to survive. You can't go from rags to riches in a \"strong eat the weak\" country - you either do whatever it is you have to do - like Nico - to survive, or you let yourself and your close ones get killed. There are other things the game criticizes as well, like that one conversation where Nico criticizes the food in the city for using \"chemicals that your body spends time getting it off your system\", or something along those lines. I don't think I need to mention that this isn't something they added as a joke, because it is very much there. The game's serious and dark tone might be considered bad by people, but it is because of this dark tone and seriousness that we can actually learn some lessons from it and open our eyes to some truths in our lives.\n\nThe gameplay itself isn't really that complicated, except when it comes to driving the vehicles in the game. They are based on a realistic driving system and although it is debatable how much of a good gaming experience it really is when they made it so realistic, since it introduces a huge learning curve and can end up frustrating the player, I actually ended up loving it for what it is, except when it came to driving motorcycles of any form. The game's simplicity in other regards is what makes it pretty good, in my eyes. Though it sometimes doesn't work the way you think it would (like when you are playing with a controller and have to use auto aim), it is nevertheless solid enough that those are only minor inconveniences and not the kind of problem where you'd want to stop playing the game.\n\nThis game definitely deserves more attention and love - but Rockstar really needs to fix this game themselves if they are still keeping it on Steam's store, because the current situation of the game is not acceptable.\n\n",
      "Minesweeper influenced design feels like a fresh take on the Slay-the-Spire-like genre.  Now that I've won with all six classes, and done some of the unlockable difficulty levels, I feel that I've gotten my money's worth with the game, and I have enjoyed the time I've spent so far, but I don't expect great longevity beyond this point.\n\nI do have some minor gripes:\n\n* The pacing on unlocking new classes feels too slow.  It would be nice if the approach was the fairly standard one of unlocking a new class when you win with the previous one, but here there is a currency which is acquired throughout runs, and I found that I usually had to have two winning runs with the previous class to earn enough currency to unlock a new one.\n* Optimal play with some classes requires memorizing tiles which are revealed, and then on later turns these tiles are hidden.  Taking damage because I misremembered what was hidden behind a tile feels unfun and at-odds with what the game otherwise wants to be.\n* I would prefer if the harder difficulty settings were unlocked from the get-go, rather than grinding through easier difficulty settings to find the challenge.\n\nOtherwise, though, it's a fun game with an adorable art style, and not just a clone of the other Spire-likes around.  Recommended if your expectation is to get ten hours or so of strategic puzzling.",
      "[h1]Dishonored 2.[/h1]\n[i]If old Samuel could see me now...[/i]\n\n[b][u]Introduction[/u][/b]\nAt its core, Dishonored 2 is little more than a mechanically and narratively contiguous continuation of the Dishonored formula. This isn't a bad thing - the first Dishonored was one of the best stealth-action games of all time - but innovation is too often overlooked in the games industry. DH2 does bring some nuance to the franchise, but new drawbacks are packaged in as well. Put plainly, Dishonored 2 is a game I adore just as much as the original, but there are aspects that certainly left me wishing for better.\n\n[b][u]Plot[/u][/b]\nThe game begins 15 years following Empress Jessamine's assassination, and her daughter, Empress Emily Kaldwin, has ruled the isles since that time. Her father and Lord Protector, Corvo Attano, advises and keeps close watch over her at court. Quickly after Dishonored 2's opening however, the Duke of Serkonos, Luca Abele, comes to Emily's royal tower - bearing a gift. He brings Emily's supposed long lost aunt, Delilah Kaldwin, who then immediately stages a coup in a bid to take the throne. She is successful, and you must escape the city of Dunwall as either Emily or Corvo (more on that later). You then travel to Karnaca, the capital of Serkonos, where you begin a personal crusade to [i]take back what's yours.[/i]\n\n[b][u]Technical Revamp[/u][/b]\nShifting focus for a look at DH2's presentation, the game is gorgeous. There's a hint of the old, comic-book-like aesthetic that was present in the original game, but the graphical fidelity has been greatly improved in this sequel. The textures, lighting, animations, visual effects, and environments are all elegantly rendered. It's easily one of the most beautiful games of 2016. As for the audio; sound effects and voices are realistic, and the OST is as iconic, if not more so than the first game's. Although, when it comes to performance, Dishonored 2 clearly falters. DH2 was a technical mess on launch, and while it runs decently now; some bugs, stutters, and crashes still persist. Overall the presentation is good, but the performance is surely sub-par.\n\n[b][u]Setting & Exploration[/u][/b]\nAs stated earlier, Dishonored 2 is set in Serkonos's city of Karnaca; known as The Jewel of the South. Gone are the dark grays and subdued browns of Dunwall, as Karnaca replaces them with bright, pastel blues and yellows. The metropolis has distinct cultural differences from Dunwall as well, whether it's the widespread use of wind-power over whale oil, or Karnaca's reliance on silver mining to employ its working class. In terms of level design, DH2's stages are much more expansive than anything seen in the first game too. There's lots to explore in every district of Karnaca, especially when verticality and hidden locations are taken into account. There's several routes toward all objectives as well; emphasizing Arkane's \"play your way\" motto. All considered, Dishonored 2's game world is exceedingly well-built.\n\n[b][u]Depth in the Details[/u][/b]\nOne of the most effective ways DH2 differentiates itself from its predecessors is through what I'd call 'structural gimmicks.' To break up the standard pacing, a couple of the game's missions have special set-pieces which can completely turn gameplay convention on its head. An example of this is the 'Clockwork Mansion' on the fourth level. This inventor's home has levers in essentially every chamber that reconfigures a room's layout - such as turning a trophy room into a grand hall. These levers can be used to access new areas or evade enemies, and even reveal traversable spaces behind the walls. It's this degree of imaginative design depth that distinguishes Dishonored 2 from most other games in its genre.\n\n[b][u]Stealth & Combat[/u][/b]\nMoving over to the core gameplay loop, not much has changed from the first game. The stealth and combat are still just as exquisitely implemented as before, with only a couple of refinements. The deviations that come to mind are that drop-assassinations can now be used non-lethally as drop-knockouts, and assassination animations are a much more brutal (but cathartic) spectacle to watch than before. Dishonored 2's central mechanics are near flawless to be sure, but this sequel suffers by adding few new gameplay elements to the mix. Except - well - there is one big feature I've neglected to elaborate on as of yet.\n\n[b][u]Emily [i]or[/i] Corvo[/u][/b]\nIn Dishonored 2, you can play as either Emily Kaldwin, [i]or[/i] Corvo Attano. When Delilah first takes the throne you get a moment to choose one or the other, after which the character you don't pick is turned into a cold, stone statue. Both Emily and Corvo have separate voice actors and personalities, but they share the same goal throughout the game's duration: to save the last of their family, and reclaim the throne for the true Kaldwin heiress. After receiving the mark of The Outsider, Emily and Corvo have different magical abilities too. Where Corvo has blink, Emily has far reach; or where Corvo can stop time, Emily can chain together the lives of her enemies, and kill or incapacitate several people at once. All in all, the decision to allow the player to progress the campaign as either Emily or Corvo was a stroke of brilliance in my estimation.\n\n[b][u]Main Story[/u][/b]\nReturning to the main story - it's another point of criticism for me. There are some magnificent aspects; such as the nostalgic callbacks to events in the first Dishonored or reappearances of some of the original game's best characters, but all considered most of the writing is retreading a beaten path. Just as in Dishonored 1, the game flows from mission to mission where the chief objective is simply to eliminate a key player obstructing your path to the throne. This is perfectly fine from a gameplay perspective, but it can lead to a bit of déjà vu from a narrative outlook. Dishonored 2's writing quality isn't poor, but it doesn't distance itself from the comfortable story-staging of its predecessor, making it feel slightly lazy.\n\n[b][u]A Reactive World[/u][/b]\nOn the other side of the same coin, the narrative reactivity of Dishonored 2's world to your choices is truly admirable. Playing DH2 in high chaos; where you murder many people throughout the game, results in huge environmental storytelling changes compared to low chaos. Here's an example. If you flood the streets of Karnaca red with blood, subsequent levels show you've harmed the city's inhabitants before you even arrive. Citizens’ moods and perceptions will have soured as they become depressed or monstrous in the wake of their crumbling city - causing suicides and murders to spike throughout Karnaca. And corpses bring bloodflies, which further tarnishes The Jewel of the South in a vicious cycle. You can, of course, avoid all this... by showing a whole lot of care in your actions toward others.\n\n[b][u]Conclusion[/u][/b]\nWhen all is said and done, the Dishonored formula is a fantastic one that it's hard to not have fun with. Karnaca is riddled with environmental detail, the stealth mechanics are flawless, combat is devilishly enjoyable, and the game judges you intelligently on your choices. The Dishonored IP is incredibly strong... The tweaks provided are appreciable; I just wish DH2 had made a concerted effort to make it even stronger. But, god-dammit, I enjoyed Dishonored 2 way too much over it's 20+ hour campaign to critique it any longer. Get the game and play it - despite all my pissy complaints, you won't be disappointed.\n\n[h1]Personal Rating: 9/10 - Absolutely Outstanding[/h1]",
      "As a cybersecurity professional , I would classify this game as malware, or at the least adware.\nWhy? It opens up a number, at least 10 when I checked, of connections to various points on the internet which have no purpose in running the game. They are only there so the vendor can spam you with advertising, track you, or for other unspecified activities. \nAs such, I can NOT recommend this game. \n\nTo verify, I disconnected my computer from the internet. The game ran fine without the advertising and tracking. \nThen I connected back to the internet, and launched the game. The game opened at least 10 connections(!).\nThen, while still connected to the internet, I blocked the game's network-connecting executables in the firewall. In such a case, the game behaves differently, apparently it sees there is an active connection so it runs for a while, then when it cannot make it's for-bad-purposes network connections, it terminates and you can't play. \nThis is bad behavior that I would only expect from spyware and malware. I hope the vendor fixes it so the software runs in the manner they declare - it is supposed to not require network connectivity after the initial run as they describe in the System Requirements. \nSteam should be reigning in this behavior as well.",
      "Before I begin, are you a fan of modern art? If no, I can safely say move on, this isn't the game for you. If yes, then you can appreciate that there is a lot of famous modern art. Some pieces you will find yourself drawn to and feel something about them, and others won't evoke any real response. This is true for most things in life, but we tend to try and find reasons why we feel a certain way about other mediums, while with art we are usually happy enough to admit the various factors like skill, materials used etc. don't really impact our overall opinion of the piece.\n\nKentucky Route Zero is an incredibly well made and obviously incredibly personal game, and the level of effort put into it is astonishing, and I didn't like it. I wish I liked it, it seems so much like something I should like, but I don't. The strangest thing is, I would call this the game's greatest triumph. \"Games as Art\" has been an ongoing debate for years, but artist's always make something for themselves, while most games are made to be enjoyed. The fact that I didn't like this but I can't actually pinpoint the reason is evidence that this might be something more than most other games in this space.\n\nI won't go on too much longer here because while I cannot recommend something I didn't enjoy, I do absolutely think anyone interested in narrative games try the first two acts. I did enjoy the first act and can recommend that with no reservations, but from the second act onwards my interest and patience just declined more and more. I have no problem with wordy games, I've played plenty of visual novels that took 50+ hours to complete, but here I feel more and more of the story was being told with blanks I was supposed to fill in, but I just wasn't engaged enough with the characters and setting to bother with that, so you can easily see how this would become more frustrating over time.\n\nI wouldn't change a thing about this game, to me that would be like asking a painter to add in a few more trees to a finished piece. This game exists as a piece of art. I didn't like it, but you might love it, and you might not be able say why either, and that's a big achievement.",
      "Steam, for gods sake, give us a neutral recommendation button.\n\nSooo, long story short, the game is nice and has beautifull artwork. It´s also massivly too short. This are the only objective things I can say about it. \n\nNow to be a bit more real here. I bought this game, because I played another game like this, let´s call it \"Blue Sticks Bar\". And that game hooked me into this genre.\nNormally I´m someone who likes extensive interaction with a Games Story more than anything else. For this reason I hated TTG and similar stuff. But that Barkeeping game had such a complex Story and such good Characters that I fell in love with it and by extension the Genre.\n\nSo I got myself Coffee Talk. And boy oh boy let me tell ya, I´m seriously torn with this game. Partway through I thought I would give it a searing bad review. But then I played through it and noticed something. This game isn´t bad, just painfully average. And, I hate to say this, but I´m probably too mature for it.\n\nNow don´t get me wrong.\nSome things here are just wonderfull. The Artstyle? Fantastic (exept for a couple minor things)\nI´m guessing the music is also good if you like it.\n\nBut already there are cracks there. Something (mildly) dramatic is happening and some coffee house tunes are playing in the Background. It´s honestly just laughable.\nAnd that word is a great segway into talking about the Story. You know that moment when you´re browsing and find (mostly on Tumblr) some really cute little story idea? This is that the game. Problem is, that a Story that deals with, for example racism, growing up, PTSD and some other really serious matters can´t be as shallow as this.\n\nYou have to decide. Either you´re doing Babies first social awareness Storyline and leave out some of this stuff, OR you do a real mature story that I can´t sum up in one single sentence.\n\nI really want to like this Game. I´m a lonely little Geek, so a Story about interesting People in a Shadowrun-light Setting sounded right up my alley. But it was simply too dissappointing. \n\nI wouldn´t refund this game even if I could, since it had some good stuff in it. \nBut sadly I can´t recommend it.\n\n\nWow, I got through this all without swearing, nice one!",

      "For the past 4 years I couldn't get myself to finish a single game without having to force myself to do it(and even then I failed). I couldn't enjoy SP games no matter how good the gameplay or the story was. I kept buying games hoping to find that one game that would do the trick. This was FF XV for me. Despite of all my friends advising me against buying it because it was just going to be another game that would sit around in my library, I decided to give it a try.\n\nIt actually felt like I went back in time to when I could play SP games for hours without getting bored after an hour or two.\n\nI admit I skipped most sidequests and I'll try going back to them sooner or later, although it may not be the best game out there in terms of content(you can finish the game on easy skipping most secondary quests in about 20-25 hours) or story development, playing through it felt like a new experience. In fact, even after finishing the game there's still plenty of things to do and in my opinion, even playing it through again just to spend more time with Noctis and his friends is worth it.\n\nThe story is not mindblowing, the combat system is really fun but far from flawless, most sidequests aren't well written but at its core, at least for me, FF XV has something to it that other games lack. I can't say it magically restored my old passion for gaming but it has given me a reason to at least try to get into it again.\n\nIf you haven't played it yet I sincerely envy you, I would love to experience it all over again from the start, it has been a memorable journey to say the least and I hope that you are willing to give it a try. ^^",

Where are my lootboxes and micro transactions?!\n\nMy main thought after I beat GRIS was, \"I don't really understand anything that just happened, but it sure was pretty.\"\n\nI was absolutely amazed how a game with zero actual dialogue could move me to tears, just on strenght of its visuals and music. In general, the whole theme of dealing with grief/depression spoke to me in a way that I didn't expect.  It's one of those games you play to \"feel\" more than for the gameplay itself.\n\nI have PTSD from dealing with my wife getting a boyfriend, and this game made me cry several times while playing it. Especially during the scene where you're swimming away from the eel. That symbolism to me perfectly captures the feeling of trauma recovery. I'd spent time finding the little lights throughout that section of the game and activating the turtle which ultimately saved me from my own darkness and helplessness.\n\nIt felt like hope. It was such a good representation of how the coping skills I'd learned and the hard work I'd put in were finally seeming to pay off. It's when you're at your weakest that you learn how strong you actually are. I cried like a baby during and after that scene. It made me realize how much I've actually overcome, and how grateful I am to be free.\n\nGris truly is a beautiful game and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a slow paced experience. The only bit of criticism I have for the game is it certainly gives \"not like the other girls\" vibes at times, but I think this is quite easy to get over.\n\nIn conclusion: the visuals are stunning,  the music is beautiful and knows exactly when to kick in, the platforming elements are fantastic, and it’s story and themes are spectacular without a single word.

Especially on the library mission. The remastered visuals look nice but I find that it deviates way too much from the original vision of Bungie. You can switch between the old and new graphics with a press of a button. \nOverall a smooth [b][i] Wort out of 10 with a touch of \"this cave is not a natural formation\".[/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Halo 2 Anniversary: [/h1] The second game in the series and the last one for the PC until 15 years later with the release of MCC. The game has remastered visuals as well as fully CGI remastered cutscenes. The remastered visuals are really well done and true to the original artwork and the CGI cutscenes are top notch with quality that can easily surpass the CGI level of some movies. Same gameplay from 15 years ago but it surprisingly holds up pretty well. I did experience some stuttering on this game ever so often but that could just be my system. Again you can switch between the classic and remastered graphics with the press of a button. Even during cutscenes. Just don't shake the light bulb. \nIn summary, I'd give this game a [b][i] Wort Wort Wort out of 10 with a slight slight tinge of heresy. [/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Halo 3: [/h1] The magnum opus of Bungie and the big final conclusion to the halo trilogy. The port to PC was a decent port (well it better be after 13 years!) with little to no technical issues. I faced a desync issue during co-op play on a specific mission until I locked my framerate to 60 fps. I tried to replicate the issue again later on but I had no luck reproducing it. If only were it so easy.\nThe gameplay is similar but sometimes bigger in scale than halo 2 and holds up well. The visuals have not been remastered for halo 3 but they still look good for what they are. \nI give this game a [b][i] Wort in the Wort out of 10. Wake me when you need me.

It uses the same engine as Halo 3 and so the fidelity isnt much a leap from Halo 3 but the art style is drastically different and takes on a noir style with washed out colors. Kinda reminds me a little bit of Deus ex Human Revolution tbh. Even more so because of its semi open world/hub design.\nThe PC port is as good as Halo 3 if not better and I didn't face any issues. \nThis is a solid [b][i] how many engineers did you murder before dare asked out of 10. [/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Halo Reach: [/h1] Halo Reach would be the final halo game that would be developed by Bungie. Ironically, this game was the first to release for the MCC on PC and is also chronologically the first in the timeline of the main series. Quite frankly the port was not very good. It had audio issues, visual downgrades and many more problems. However in time, 343 has corrected almost all of these issues and now it is a great port to PC. Reach takes place before the events of Halo Combat Evolved and is a prequel to the entire series. It puts you into the shoes of Noble Six, a member of Noble Team that are tasked to... well I wont spoil everything here. Just know that you're stepping into some shoes the rest of the squad would rather leave unfilled. \nThe artstyle is a grittier and more grim depiction of the halo universe and fits well within the narrative of the game. \nThis game gets a [b][i] pair of gúta out of 10 from me. [/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Halo 4: [/h1] After Bungie stepped down as developers of the halo franchise, the mantle was given to 343 industies to carry on the legacy of Halo. The very first game by 343i came in the form of Halo 4 and would be a direct sequel to the conclusion of the Halo trilogy in Halo 3. \nThe change in team came with it, the change in art style, level design and gameplay loop. I will just call this change \"different\". \nThe port to PC is pretty decent aside from some stuttering I faced during coop play. \nOverall this game is a [b][i] 343 out of 10 unless you get on the bad side of Cortana. [/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Multiplayer, Firefight and Spartan Ops: [/h1]\nEach game has its own multiplayer except for Halo 3 ODST. The multiplayer itself is fun and they have enabled cross-play between platforms making finding matches easier.\nThere are so many multiplayer game modes within each game and covering them all is beyond the scope of this short review. :) \nThere are your traditional TDM, Big Team Battle, Capture the flag and such; but there are also interesting and odd game types which are a good change of pace.\nAs for the multiplayer progression, there is a battlepass system in place where you can unlock various cosmetics such as armor parts, gun skins and vehicle skins for each game.\nThe game is updated with seasons that add more features and cosmetics.\nAlthough the idea of a battlepass may put some of us off, the system is completely free and you dont miss out on previous seasons as they are all accessible indefinitely.\nYou can even pick and choose which seasons to progress in.\nIf you want some co-op within multiplayer, then Halo Reach and Halo 3 ODST have a mode called firefight where you have to fend off wave after wave of enemies with changing modifiers or mutations. \nAn alternative to firefight is Spartan Ops, a game mode exclusive to Halo 4. It is a cooperative campaign(you can solo) where you get to use your customised spartan from multiplayer. Keep in mind that although there is a set narrative here, the quality of production in spartan ops is nowhere near the level as that of the main Halo 4 campaign.\n\nOverall the multiplayer, firefight and spartan ops are solid additions to the already superb collection of 6 campaigns. The only thing missing right now is a custom server browser which I believe is in the works. \nEDIT: They have added in a custom server browser for Halo Reach, Halo: Combat Evolved, Halo 2 and Halo 3! :D\n\n[h1] Forge and Theatre: [/h1] \nForge is where you can fool around with various kinds of halo props and items within maps and make your own creations that you can share with others. It has basically endless content.\nJust a cherry on top over all the other content that you are getting with the collection. Forge is available for Halo 2 anniversary, Halo 3, Halo Reach and Halo 4.\nTheatre mode is exactly what it sounds like. Record clips from the game and play them back later with a free form camera. Perfect for content creation. \n\n[h1] Modding: [/h1]\nAs if there wasn't already so much content in the vanilla game, Halo MCC allows you run the game in anti cheat free mode, where you can install and play community created mods.\nGoes without saying that this will only age like fine wine.\n\n[h1] Well that's it folks: [/h1]\nYou mad lads that made it up to here; thank you for reading the ramblings of a mad man. \nDustin Echoes will forever watch over you.",
      "Dave the Diver is a charming little 'Indie'* that still surprises you with new mechanics even hours in. The various activity cutscenes are pretty funny as well.\n\nJust a word of warning though. Mintrocket is NOT a indie studio, it's a subsidiary of NEXON, so DtD is entirely a NEXON game, and with how their reputation is it's pretty understandable to not buy this game just because of that.",
      "A criminally underrated game, I have seldom seen a developer take their original hit which was already almost perfect, and actually manage to improve on it in every way shape and form. You do not need to have played the original to play or enjoy this game. Their stories are completely seperate.\n\nThe game itself is much less linear than its predecessor. The best way I can explain the feeling of going through the environments without referencing Grimrock itself is by saying it felt an awful lot like Myst to me, just with combat. Required puzzles for progression were challenging but not impossible, some of the secret challenges were much more difficult. I admit I used an online guide more than a few times, but it did nothing to diminish my enjoyment of the game. It is immersive, challenging, and satisfying. \n\nThe only drawback I can think of is the difficulty. It feels like you cannot win with any group composition, I suggest no more than 2 of any class or weapon/armor type user. I went with a warrior, two rogues(one range), and a mage, this way you as well makes you unlikely to complete a difficult fight or puzzle and be rewarded with something you cannot use. Combat itself can be challenging as I said, but you will rarely feel like you are simply incapable of winning. There are obvious ways to optimize the way you approach an encounter the second time if you die the first.\n\nBe prepared to immerse yourself, you must pay attention to your surroundings, read and remember notes you find, explore every nook and cranny you can find, and you will be rewarded. Good luck!\n",
      "Civ 5, Heroes of Might and Magic had a baby together and that baby grew up and had a baby with Endless Space and this baby has now grown up and it is glorious in every level.\n\nIncredibly polished, incredibly neat, incredibly addictive and a game that stands out from the rest. If you like Empire-builders, this game is for you!\n\nIgnore the \"Early access\". This game is ready to be sold. I have only experienced one single bug in this game and the MP works like a clockwork. It's highly optimised, full of features and pretty to look at. I wish more Devs would make their games this way, it warms my heart!",
      "The British Forces give the Allies a bit of the German defensive capacities. It has the problem of adding too many buildings to a game that is, in its core, dynamic and based on movement and aggressiveness instead of turtling. The British units are diverse and interesting, bringing much to the table. \n\nThe DLC lacks a proper campaign for the Brits, unfortunately, even though Caen, Goodwood, Arnhem and Walcheren could have been done in some interesting missions. But, for a game focused on multiplayer, the Tommies are obligatory in everybody's library.",

      "I love this game. In fact, I've loved it since I was in highschool about 8 years ago. My friend and I used to play this game together all the time on my flashdrive. We were always discussing & trying to understand the ins-&-outs of the game and how to get a specific ending depending on what you did. Playing this brought me back to those good times in that library.\n\nThe OSTs are nostalgic, the gameplay is about the same and the artwork is amazing as ever(actually the graphics are much better with this remake).\nThe only complaint I have is that it lags at random times(though usually in the menu). The original IB on RPGMaker never did that.\nOverall I'm glad I bought this so I could support the Dev and thank them for all those years of entertainment-\nI just wish there wasn't so much lag over an RPGMaker game.",
      "[h1] 8.5/10 [/h1]\n\n[b] Please note that The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles is a very independent entry in the Ace Attorney series in terms of plot. Even if you have not played any of the Ace Attorney titles before, it will not affect your understanding of the game's plot. [/b]\n\nThis courtroom text adventure game in late 19th century Japan and British have a lot of features, even with the previous Ace Attorney works are very different. With the detailed character costumes and backgrounds, the strong sense of history and atmosphere, the majestic music, and excellent characterization, along with the game's detailed 3D character animation, players can experience an unprecedented adventure. In the plot, The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles presents a layer-by-layer, cocooning type of plot development, each chapter of the story is closely linked, and ambiguous, no chapter is meaningless, and in the final unraveling of all the mystery, the feeling of shock and excitement brought to the player is unprecedented in any text adventure game.\n\nThe reviews of The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles tend to be polarized, and not without reason. The progression of the plot brings with it an overwhelming lack of tension in the first and middle stages of the game. The design of many of the cases in the game seems rather undisciplined, neither interesting nor deep... The Great Ace Attorney: Adventure, as the first half of the game, though the development of the subsequent plot paved a lot of ambushes, the design of the plot and puzzles makes it less interesting and often difficult to motivate players to continue playing. The climax of the game comes too late, whether the player can persist to this point is a huge problem. At the same time, the Steam version of the game globally locks 30 frames, and can not set the Japanese voice is also a very huge drawback, and very damaging to the player's gaming experience.\n\nThe quality of The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles is actually not that bad. But this can only be concluded after you have experienced the entire game in its entirety... And I think this is actually the biggest drawback of this game because the ability to keep the player until the climax of the plot is the biggest pain point of this work. If you are very patient, love the Ace Attorney series, and love the suspenseful story of players, then The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles will not let you down. If you do not have any of the above elements, perhaps The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles will not give you a memorable experience.",
      "Stephen's Sausage Roll is a game that the developer doesn't want normal people to buy, it seems. The description is literally, \"A simple 3d puzzle game.\", there is one video that shows you nothing about the game, and it's priced at $32 CND.\n\nFortunately, I'm here to tell you to get off your ass and to buy this wonderful game. The graphics are alright, the music is OK, but the puzzles are sublime.\n\nIn each level, the goal is the same: cook all the sausages and exit the level by standing on the exit level sign in the right orientation. You cook sausages by pushing them over a grill. Like in sokoban games, you can't pull the sausage (yet...), only push it. Another huge wrinkle is that sides of the sausage can only touch the grill once. If you touch a cooked side of a sausage to the grill, it will be burned and you fail the level. This little wrinkle will make you pull your hair out in some levels as you try and figure out how the hell you are going to maneuver the sausages around so they get cooked properly. A neat thing about the game is that if you fail, you can still continue playing the level, which might help you figure out how to play it.\n\nYou'll have a section (part of an island) that has a number of puzzles for you to solve in any order, so if you get stuck, you can try another one (until you get to the last puzzle of the section). Once you complete a section, a new section will open up with more puzzles.\n\nYour little guy has tank controls, which you will find extremely useful, as turning to the left or right near a sausage will push it in different directions. A nice detail is that the all of the puzzles make up the island section. When you activate a puzzle, the rest of the island drops away into the sea, leaving you on a tiny puzzle island.\n\nEach section introduces new mechanics into the game. First you'll just be pushing the sausages, but then you'll be stacking them, skewering them (you would think this would make things easier, but no! You can't turn when you have a skewered sausage!), walking on them...\n\nI would say that these levels are on the level of Snakebird, though I found many of them easier than Snakebird's puzzles (maybe I'm better at sokoban games than I know?). These are the kind of puzzles that you walk away from frustrated, but come back to a few hours later with the solution. This is the game where there are so many ah-ha! moments that make you feel smart. You have no idea what to do at first, but eventually you get better and better. You might not see solutions at first, but you begin to see where you need to go to solve the puzzle, and then work backwards from there. It's wonderful!\n\nIf you're having trouble, there's a community guide that has all the solutions, which is super helpful (though not as much when I was playing because it wasn't complete!).\n\nIt might be expensive, but I took 36 hours to solve all the puzzles and it was worth every penny.",

      "Not really that great of a game. It's fairly unengaging, very slow paced, impossible boss fights just a few hours in.

CD Projeck Red really made the Witcher and Withcer 2 for the hardcore RPG fans. The experience just isn't worth the time investment on this one in my opinion. Not going to finish it and just go enjoy the third game instead.\n\nEDIT: \nTR;DR: A mediocre hack-n-slash that has been dummed down from the predeccesor for consoles.",
      "First off, just want to say this isn't a Metroidvania. This is a Zelda clone. And a good one!\n\nI bought this game because I heard it really put stress on you. You have limited time to complete the game and NPCs will begin dying if you aren't fast enough. Pretty crazy, right? Well, I do have a few gripes with that, but let me point out the good stuff first:\n+ Amazing combat. You have access to both guns and swords, but most of your damage will likely come from melee weapons since they have the ability to do an extremely-easy-to-pull-off PARRY! Parrying an enemy stuns it and gives your next attack against it a massive damage multiplier. All enemies, all bosses, and most projectiles are parryable, so this is what combat ends up revolving around. Even though I call it easy, you still get that cool feeling when you walk into an ambush and clear it without taking a hit, so it never gets dull as you go through the game.\n\n+ Good dungeon design. Since this game takes after Zelda, it's not shy about inserting a few puzzles into its dungeons. The overworld as well has quite a few surprising secrets and side quests that you won't be expecting when you play for the first time.\n\n+ Sequence breaks. This is mostly for New Game+ (or New Game Extra, a separate mode where you have access to major exploration items from the start, but not your whole endgame inventory), but it was interesting to find out how many secret paths and shortcuts there were, and how tightly they were managed. The devs thought of everything!\n\nSo now for the bad stuff.\n- Underwhelming story. Guess how much is really explained over the course of this story. If you guessed \"all of it\", you would be completely wrong and here's your dunce hat. Unsighted ends up spending so much of its time on the protagonist's relationships that it fails to answer several of the more important questions concerning the game's backstory. Why was there was a war? Who started it? Where are the humans now? Why are they so disorganized? Why do they seem to have no chain of command whatsoever? How did the automatons ever win anything at all at any point when they seem so extremely outclassed? I guess it doesn't matter. Look, there's two robot-girls kissing.\n\n- Fake pressure. I heard there was going to be pressure before I started the game, so I decided to go DEFCON 1 from the get-go and rush everything. I ended up completing the game in 10 in-game days and I felt pretty good about it. Zero NPC deaths! Zero! I'm a super awesome amazing hero, right? Well, credits roll and... the only achievement I get is the one for beating the game. No one really cares and apparently you're meant to play through multiple times anyway. So... why did I ever care? Why is this mechanic even in the game? All it did was make me shy away from general exploration and side quests since all of those things are less important than, ya know, saving the world. You can call that interesting, but when it has no payoff, it ends up being frustrating.\n\n- No post-game. Did I mention, if you bumrush the game and finish with just hours left on everyone's timers, you don't get to do any extra no-timer exploring afterwards? No, the game's over. Load the save and you get set back to where you were before fighting the final boss. If you want to do any actual exploring, that's what \"Explorer\" mode is for. You know, that mode that makes you feel like you're cheating?\n\nBasically, Unsighted is another game filled with missed opportunities. I recommend this game because the core gameplay and level design is very well done and very well executed, but you should probably know this before you start:\n\nThe only pressure here is the one you imagine. Since the game does nothing to acknowledge your successes, just play it at your own pace and don't be shy about using Explorer. Shame on the devs for hailing the agony of defeat, but not the thrill of victory.",
      "Medium performance issues (as of 2/28/22) but GOTY game. This game is amazing and absolutely dripping with content. FromSoft didn't make Dark Souls 4. This game is Dark Souls 4, 5, and 6 all in one. Absolutely massive game and the open world part doesn't feel like an attempt to pad the game like most games, here's why:\n- Picking up items in the open world doesn't have a pickup animation. This might not seem like a lot but go play something like Dragon Age: Inquisition and you'll know what I'm talking about.\n- You can pick up items while on horseback (also no animation), Greatly speeds up looting while in the open world\n- Summoning pools makes getting summoned for bosses is easier than ever. All you have to do is be in the same general overworld location as a pool and all location get a summon sign\n- Sooooo many more bonfire locations. Can also fast travel from almost anywhere using the in-game map.\n- packed with stuff to do. Very rarely are you walking/riding for long periods before running into a dungeon/boss/camp/npc/etc. Every single side location has something to discover, Plus you never know what you're going to get and the feeling of discovery is unlike any other game out there.\n\nThere are a lot of improvements over previous installments as well. In no particular order, here are some of my standouts:\n- POWERSTANCING IS BACK BABYYYYY. Was always my favorite thing from DS2.\n- Slottable weapon arts. Taking the weapon art system from DS3 and making it even better. This system is also tied to the weapon affinity system which allows you to switch up the scaling of a weapon at any bonfire. No more committing to a specific element or stat.\n- The open world makes the game more accessible. Hit a wall with one zone? Just go somewhere else and come back when stronger. Sekiro had this a little but this game it's extremely pronounced.\n- The statues of Marika make it so the runbacks for bosses is not nearly as grueling. These statues work as \"respawn only\" bonfires that you can choose to respawn back at and are usually just outside a boss fight room after a lengthy run. You can't rest at them or adjust your build there, but they prevent the grueling runback and allow you to smash your face into a boss over and over with minimal downtime.\n- Having a dedicated jump button but keep the power of jump attacks. Risky usually, but can also be used as a counter to low swinging attacks. This also adds into the next system of...\n- Poise breaking enemies. Is done by heavy attacking, jump attacking and guard countering. Adds even more move types to the game and makes every weapon a totally different playstyle and adds to the replay value.\n- What are guard counters? After successfully blocking and attack, you can follow it up with a special heavy attack that has high poise damage. Allows for more critical hits. You might think this makes it easier but it takes more skill than you'd think to time these ripostes and it always feels good.\n\nAs with any game, it's not for everyone, but if you love souls games, you'd be doing yourself a disservice by missing this one. If you've never played a souls game, this is the best one to try. The most accessible by far. No crazy hard tutorial bosses, the new ashen summoning bell gives some great support in difficult areas, and the fact you can always leave harder fights and come back to them later makes it so you rarely run into situations where you know booting up the game means you're gonna be brick walling until either the boss dies or you give up.",
      "Never understood why everybody started hating this game.\nFirst it was too hard, so dev made it easier.\nThen it was too clunky, so dev remade the UI again and again (it's still not perfect though but I saw big improvements overtime).\nThen it was another thing and another one and no matter what dev team did, people were still mad at them ...\nI did enjoy this game since the beginning, I adapted each time the game changed and yet people kept whining because it wasn't exactly how they felt it shoud have been.\nAfter all this hard work and still getting pooped in the face, the dev team left ... how strange, right ?\n\nI'm not mad at the dev team, but I'm so sad that people can't understand that making others miserable because they don't have exactly what they want (and having paid for it is no excuse to this behavior in my opinion) will make them give up on their task ...\n\nFor what it's worth, I miss you Handyman team :(, but thank you anyway for the actual game cause I really don't feel that I've been robbed and I still enjoy it from time to time.",

      "Only originally bought this to support the artist, since I'm a huge fan of his pixel art work. It's amazing, and there's a tonne of eye candy to fill your eyeballs with. However, I can't recommend this to everyone as after the first few hours it's become a bit of a chore.\n\n- The game is a \"clicker\" type with rpg/upgrade elements. It's too slow to play in the background/absent mindedly but not fast enough to keep your attention fully.\n- Each round/attempt at a boss takes way too goddamn long. \n- Barely any interaction with the world. You build tower defense style, and equip new items, but beyond that you don't have any special abilities, no \"oh shit\" once per loop power, no ability to target specific enemies, nothing. Just watch everything play out and hope your little guy doesn't get pulped.\n- Crafting/Supplying is sort of hidden away and if you don't know about dismantling you'll never grind out all the items you need to build new stuff.\n- Lore/Journal entries are hidden away and require resources to unlock using a little button on the bottom of the screen that's easy to miss. I only found it 20 hours in. The writing is cringey and obviously done by someone who probably enjoys Adam Sandler films.\n- The card system is a neat idea, but jesus christ there's too much garbage shuffling. Imagine playing MtG with a deck of 100 cards and 90 of them are lands, and everytime you get a new hand you reshuffle the whole deck so all you get is more lands. Oblivion (destroys a tile) rarely, if ever, pops up. \n- Character skills are kinda bad? You might get a good one every level (which again, takes forever) but half the time it'll be useless \"leave 10% of food/resources at camp\" when you're not doing a resource grind run.\n- So much trash equipment you have to sort through and breaks game flow.\n\nAnd the biggest \"don't recommend\" from me would be the issue with how combining tiles works. If you put two tiles beside each other they sometimes change the tiles to something else. Example - put a Vampire Mansion beside a Village and you get a town full of ghouls that after 3 loops around the map turns into an upgraded town. But you still get trash equipment from the quests it gives, and putting a Vampire Mansion beside any other type of town doesn't change that town at all. So there's no reason to experiment, and it really limits the gameplay. You'd think they'd focus on that aspect gameplay wise, especially with experimentation to get the most bonuses out of all your tiles... but no. There's a small list of things that interact with each other, and that's it.\n\nI still highly recommend it since the game is cheap, the art is amazing and the artist/indie devs should get support. But I think it's a good 2-3 major updates, expansions or fan modding away from getting really, really amazing.",

      "While still a work very much in progress, Nuclear Throne is currently one of my favorite games. It's a roguelike dungeon crawler with heavy \"bullet-hell\" elements and a little RPG sprinkled on top. When you begin a session of Nuclear Throne, you choose from one of several well-designed & freakish \"mutants\", each with their own special attributes which, in itself, does much to add variety (there's also a random-select option which is a fun idea in this particular case). The goal of each stage is to exterminate all of the enemies. After doing so, a portal opens which takes your mutant freak to the next level. There are a great many weapons with which to inflict meyhem on your adversaries. As you gain experience points, in the form of green goo earned by killing enemies & also found in cache jars, you'll be able to choose new persistent perks for your character (such as more HP or certain weapons doing more damage). Every so-often, you'll encounter a boss. The bosses tend to pop in during the height of an already-in-progress battle which makes beating them all-the-more difficult & hectic.\n\nOriginally, this game did not have controller support which was a great disappointment (though I had been ejoying it anyway, using the keyboard and mouse). However, a recent update rectified this and the gameplay using a dual-analog controller (such as that of the Xbox 360) is just fantastic. Like Ultratron before it (another very similar game which is also worth a look; I also wrote a review for it, if you're interested in checking it out), Nuclear Throne throws you straight back to the arcades of yore and plops you in front of a Smash TV cabinet.\n\nAs a roguelike dungeon-crawler, the replay value is extremely high (due to the fact that the level and enemy layout is totally different from one session to the next). The rather extreme difficulty doesn't hurt either, as playing entails dying and thus restarting... a lot. Fortunately, said difficulty isn't of the variety that compels you to smash your controller/keyboard in frustration. Every death feels like the fault lay squarely on *your* shoulders (if only you had moved to dodge a little faster or conserved ammo a little better!), as opposed to the game feeling like it's cheating. Another stand-out feature which I think I need to bring up is the soundtrack. ...Just wow! Nuclear Throne's score is totally original and extremely surreal. It goes *miles* in lending its own atmosphere to the game. \n\nSome might consider the current price of $12.99 to be just a *little* steep for a game in this class, but considering how well it's made overall and the fun I've gotten from it (especially being in its currently pre-release/beta state), I consider it to be well worth the price. As of the time of this writing, the developer(s) is very active and updates are coming quite frequently.\n\nUPDATE 01/12/16: I hadn't played this game in quite a while (at least 6+ months) and I wanted to check out the progress that the devs have made, etc. Well... The game starts but as soon as I select a character, it totally locks up. I can't play it at all. To make matters worse, I've heard that the devs have since \"abandoned\" development of this game (so it's not likely that whatever is causing the crashes for me is going to be fixed any time soon - or ever). Bummer man. I loved this game...",
      "To be honest, this game is a bit of an acquired taste. At first I didn't get it: Few options to customize your army, at the beginning of a battle every unit has its predetermined place on the map, there's an unforgiving time limit to reach your objectives and the graphics could be much better. The first encounters with an entrenched enemy ended in a bloodbath for my units, despite overall superiority in numbers and total command of the air. And when I learned that you don't necessarily keep your veteran units after a successful battle but sometimes have to start the next scenario with new ones, I came close to deleting the game.\n\nLuckily, I  didn't. Like any decent strategy-game, UOCII takes some time to learn. The game's mechanics and its reliance on logistics are the main differences to most others I've played. The first lesson: Your success depends heavily on understanding both your own and the enemy's supply network. Finding his vulnerable spots while protecting your own is elementary. Once you figured out where to strike and with which units, your chances improve dramatically. The AI is quite good and will help you find your own weak spots soon enough – a single forgotten enemy in your rear can easily stop the most impressive offensive, if it decides to block the one railway line supporting all your units and your HQ. +-To make things more interesting, the game relies on Headquarters, which you have to move around together with your regular units. These HQ can and must be improved over time to learn additional “skills” like bridge-building, special orders, emergency supply etc. During a battle, they must be kept within range of your units to be effective, giving the game a bit of an role-playing-aspect: One or several generals moving around, each commanding a part of your force, never too close to the firing line, all the while learning new skills and helping your units to do a limited number of special tricks. Nice flavour.\n\nI could write a lot more, but to sum it up: UOCII is a really rewarding strategy-game with some new and interesting features I haven't found anywhere else. It's not perfect – more options to customize or to place units would be welcome and the difficulty in some of the later DLCs is quite brutal -  but all in all it's very much worth its price. Still enjoy it after several years and look forward to the next DLC (Africa) :-)",
      "Blows every single PFS game of the last decade out of the water, even those shitty D**M games that people who never played FPS games before seems to worship in order to look cool. Smooth and fast gameplay with a lot of variety. Great visuals even on medium/high settings. Story and writing is shit but pretty much on the same level as rest of the Borderlands series with the exception of the Telltale one. Writing has always been the worst part of the series, dont be delusional retards.",
      "The game vaguely reminds me of Yume Nikki and Strange Telephone due to thematic similarities, but in the end, I think it managed to be something completely different - I don't want to compare it directly to Undertale, but I got those narrative vibes as well. Unlike its exploration-based relatives, UNREAL LIFE is somewhat of a linear game, but the areas tend to loop around into the hub when using waypoints, occasionally involving some backtracking and optional achievements (including a game within a game). It took me about 6 hours to get 2 bad endings on the same playthrough, that said I am missing more than half of the achievements and probably other endings as well. Despite its modest art style, I think the locations and the world design were very good, granted the game settings are very limited for the price. The writing and characters were the highlight of the experience for me, I would say I enjoyed about 95% of the dialogue and world-building, despite being a very text-heavy game. The game tells a story in a unique way where the character can extract memories from the objects that she touched, unlocking potential hints that you will need to solve puzzles.\n\nYour room works as a hub area to which you can return for manual saves or the minigame, additionally to connecting all areas with a waypoint system, but you don't have to worry too much about those as the checkpoints are very frequent. Generally, the gameplay is just exploring 2D levels, picking up items, and occasionally solving creative sequence puzzles. The character keeps track of 3 different memories that may contain clues if you managed to miss them - it's hard to do because the important text is color-coded. I want to give the devs credit for actually putting some originality into puzzle mechanics, they were fun and not difficult enough to drag the game down. However, when the character learns about a hidden item from the memory, you have to click in the correct spot with no indication, which is perfectly fine, I only wish I realized it sooner. For any Yume fans out there, the game works as a psychedelic visual candy, with many dream-like environments and themes to navigate. \n\n[i]In a way, playing through this game reminded me of the first time I finished watching Spirited Away, the journey so immersive it left me in a state of melancholy. Do you ever get a feeling that you changed as a person after finishing a game? [/i]\n\n[h1] Pros: [/h1]\n\n+ fun characters, enjoyable narrative \n+ multiple endings and optional achievements \n+ creative puzzle based on memory mechanics \n+ nice variety of locations\n+ awesome soundtrack \n\n[h1] Feedback: [/h1]\n\n[u] Some Nitpicks [/u] - I ended up playing on a controller, but if you are using a mouse you have to drag the character around, it would be nice to have the clicking option instead - if it has one I don't know how to activate it. I was slightly confused by the main menu controls when using a controller, but if you can't figure out the buttons you can select the options with the mouse. I wish you just had the visual Q like \"new game\", \"load game\" and so on. Sometimes to progress you may have to talk to characters multiple times, so just make sure that you exhaust all dialogue before moving on. On a side note, you can softlock the game if the water turtle pushes you against the platform (not a big deal, reload 10 second checkpoint). Overall, I don't have any real issues with the game, mostly the story felt like sliding on a big stick of butter.  \n\n[b] Overall Thoughts: 9/10 [/b]\n\nIs it worth $20? Well, it's a really good game for this niche genre if you like those types of ambient/psychedelic games like Dreaming Sarah - it feels bigger and more ambitious than most. There is no question that devs put so much love into the project, but it's still a niche game at the end of the day. My skepticism slowly faded away as the game kept being compelling in the storytelling and enjoyable locations. As someone that plays many games that occupy the same space, I can't really imagine a game that offers much more than that. For me, it was a special game, and by 'special' I mean like it hit a nerve, got pretty personal. \n\n[code]Review By: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/31294838-Hidden-Gem-Discovery/ [/code]",
      "[h1][u]Wonderful game with a great battle system, but terrible netcode[/u][/h1]\n\n[h2]Foreword[/h2]\nI got to know \"Naraka: Bladepoint\" through a friend.\nAt first I was very skeptical, so I only bought the Standard Edition, and later the Ultimate and Deluxe Editions.\nFirst of all, this game has a steep learning curve with its battles.\nExactly why the game may not be suitable for everyone.\nUnfortunately, that doesn't make the playerbase any better, but read more about that below.\nNevertheless, the game and especially the combat system offers a lot of potential and has a lot of posivites to offer.\n\n[h2]Positives[/h2]\n[list]\n[*]Regular updates with ever increasing content\n[*]Few to almost no bugs and if they are, then they are fixed very quickly\n[*]Steep learning curve - Especially at the beginning the game is not easy, but you can quickly get into it with friends\n[*]Pleasant graphics\n[*]Nice sound design, which is location dependent\n[*]Potential to grind for higher ranks and for the Hall of Fame\n[*]Different game modes and events\n[*]Extremely extensive combat system - many possibilities to conter weapons\n[*]Extensive stats, either ingame or with Naraka+ mobile app (app is absolutely top!)\n[*]Well thought through character designs\n[*]Extremely individual character editor - From Thanos to Bruce Lee everything is customizable.\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Neutral[/h2]\n[list]\n[*]Climbing system - It's really good compared to other games. However, you still sometimes get stuck on edges or can't get to the platforms above.\n[*]Microtransactions - I'm personally not a fan of them, but it's not a must in this game and doesn't favor anyone.\n[*]Answers of Discord team members very questionable on some questions\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Negatives[/h2]\n[list]\n[*]Terrible netcode - players with highpings are treated preferentially\n[*]Few European players - Extremely many VPN players with many different Asian characters and languages in the voicechat\n[*]Voicechat is not well thought through\n[*]Partial performance losses\n[*]Ranking matches are partly wrong - Either with new players (Bronze) or experienced players (Asura)\n[*]Partially bad English, as well as German translation\n[*]Some abilities are combined absolutely disgusting and unfortunately more or less meta\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Review written out[/h2]\nNaraka has become a real love-hate relationship game for me.\nI love the extensive combat system and also the steep learning curve from noob to a slightly experienced player. (I am Platinum 1 - Solar 5 at the time of this review).\nSo while the combat system could be frustrating at times at first, I love it all the more now.\nOnly the climbing system, as well as some combinations of abilities or ultimates could be revised.\nFor example, it is common practice (meta) that many players use Ultimates that stun and ensure that you immediately get into the next Ultimate.\nThis is sometimes a bit frustrating, because these combinations are played very often and other heroes, especially the new ones, are not really played because of it. \nHowever, you can work around these combinations or counter them yourself. Unfortunately, this is not always easy, especially for new players.\n(For example, the combination of Valda - Viper - Tianhai).\nHowever, a victory and the killing of opponents, especially higher ones, with whom you are unfortunately sometimes matched, releases a lot of endorphins in Naraka, so that a victory feels extremely rewarding.\n\nUnfortunately, this brings me to the part that makes it extremely difficult for me to decide on a positive rating for this game.\nThe game, for being released in 2021, has a horrible netcode for a martial arts battle royale game.\nThere are extremely many Asian players who connect directly or via VPN to the europian servers.\nThis is especially noticeable when you activate the voice chat, which by the way, has no individual regulation for volume or a mute function per player.\nUnfortunately, those players have a ping beyond 150ms.\nSadly, this is a big problem for people with low latency.\nYou partly punch through enemies bodies.\nVarious focus attacks are therefore not always blockable or the opponent lags at you, while the player for himself has no lags at all.\nThis is not only unfair, but should actually no longer be a problem in 2022.\nFor example, it would be enough to not let players with a ping greater than 150ms/200ms move.\nAccording to the Discord community manager, there is a region lock and most of the names are just \"memes\" . \nBut you don't notice anything about the region lock in the game and we can theoretically connect to other servers.\n\nAnother big problem is the matchmaking.\nEven with Bronze or Silver, you are matched with Asura players when there is a lack of players.\nThis is not necessarily nice, but you get a lot of points for survival and you also learn a lot of techniques.\n\nAs negative as this all sounds, the game still gets a positive rating from me.\nI love the sound design, which comes into its proper place in the battles and is different for each location on the map.\nThis reminds me of Prince of Persia in some areas and provides more excitement in fights.\nIn addition, the varied battles, no matter how hopeless they sometimes seem, are all the more rewarding if you win.\nEspecially when you're killing another team, consisting of 3 people, as the last survivor of your team.\nThe map design is also absolutely great. Every location has been carefully thought through. \nGreat lighting design really highlights some of the locations.\nYou can overlook small bugs like misplaced branches (a branch hangs in the air next to a tree).\n\nBut my favorite part is the grinding to a higher rank. \nThe ranking system and especially the Hall of Fame encourage you to play.\nGetting into the top 100 of a much-played character feels very rewarding.\nSo does slaying a moonbane.\n\n[h2]Epilogue[/h2]\nAll in all, despite the flaws, Naraka has a lot going for it, and even though the larger issues can be extremely frustrating, the game saves itself with the extensive battle system, the incredibly great locations including sound design, and the extensive ranking system including Hall of Fame.\nI love the game because of the thoughtful little things, even if I hate it extremely at times.\n\nEven though the game can quickly become frustrating for new players, you should be aware that it has a lot to offer if you are willing to learn.\nThe accompanying app is an extremely well thought through and great gimmick in this regard.\n\nI would be happy to take you by the hand and introduce you to the game.\nJust visit us on our [URL=https://discord.nox-eagles.de]Discord[/URL].\n\nI would like to thank all of you who have read my review until the end.\nI'm looking forward to your opinions :)\nWith best regards\nYour Holt",
      "If you notice that Kagami voice sounds different, that’s because the guy who voiced him in the first game, Brad Venable, died at the beginning of last year. This time, Kagami is voiced by Austin Lee Mathews, who voiced Roche (Final Fantasy VII Remake) and Ash Carbide (Cold Steel III and IV). \n\nRest In Peace, Brad. We may forget Kaniza’s name, but we won’t forget yours. And thank you for being one of the funniest character in the game.",
      "This game has such a HUGE potential like Stardew Valley in its early days!!\nCollecting stuff, helping people by crafting potions its so rewarding and lovely pls dear developers keep working on it. I BEG YOU! :D\nSure it has some bug right now but even on day one they managed to get some fast fixes and tried their best to make it work for everyone. \nThe controls were a bit tricky in the beginning (used Playstation 5 Controller) but its just a matter of time, its just not the normal controls like in other games.\nThe music was pretty nice and chill and also the animations were super cute, i love watching little Rubrum built his sandcastles over and over again. >3< \n\nOverall a good game, but could become even more better in the future, keep going guys!!",
      "Definitely recommend !\nBut let's be honest here, it's early access and it fits the status of the game completely, threre are a couple of issues which would require change as soon as possible.\nHowever, the devs are incredibly responsive, they do listen to the community and as a result, the game is already much much much better than it originally was.\nA lot of work was already put into the game and a lot more is incoming.\n\nThis said, the game's title isn't too catchy and doesn't really reflect what the game really is.\n\nYou start the game by controlling manually controlling a train (you can control more than one later), the map is divided between the track of your opponent and your track.\n\nThe goal is to utterly destroy your opponent or at least survive waves.\n\nYou will need to travel around your track and dock to mines to build mining facilities, collect ores and bring them back to your HQ. There is also another spot you can use to build a specific building which will help you like radars.\n\nYou will use that ore to start research (new weapons, speed and whatnot) and upgrade your train (called an AMP) and build more defenses. Each building is protected by a force field which will make them hard to destroy and also protect you while you are docked to build, upgrade, repair or collect ores.\n\nYou can move freely on the track and control the speed of your AMP, change direction, change track direction and get a sattelite view to help you fight the enemy.\n\nBasically, fighting works as in an artillery game...\nThe map is always covered with fog of war but when an enemy or you fire, you will produce noise which will be clearly indicated on the map. This is when you will be able to use your recon ability to launch a projectile which will show you the area for a couple seconds and you can then fire.\nEach time you fire, you have to take into account the wind which can make your projectile miss, firing right now use a bowstring but it is going to disapear. Your firing range is also limited so you do have to travel near the opponent to be able to hit it.\n\nAnd that's pretty much it. The concept is quite inovative, it works pretty well and it will get a lot better in the future.\nIf you're scared to purchase the game right away becaue of the early access tag, I advise you to keep it in a corner and wait for it to evolve until the development reach a more advanced point because the game is pretty unique and quite beautiful.\nRight now controlling and managing the trains can be a bit tedious and not really easy to master but I think we can trust the devs team to find a solution to the problems.",
      "Dandara is inspired by a legendary warrior who fought slavery in Brazil in the 17th Century. The similarities, however, seems to stop at the name and the fact that she is a black woman fighting a vague concept referred in the game as \"opression\". \nThe game mechanics are very unusual as you can`t really move back and forth and the art style is often charming, although sometimes it gets really generic with some enemies  inspired by Egyptian culture (I thought it was supposed to be about Brazil). The difficulty escalates quite suddenly at certain points in the game, and the fact that you have to be standing still at all times to attack your enemies is pretty frustrating. After you get used to the movement in the game, it is quite fun to jump around without the frustration of having to walk slowly through a huge map as you do in some games of the genre, especially before getting upgrades that allow you to teleport or move faster.\n The story and dialogues could also have been polished a little more. Everything is very vague making it feel a little bit like a waste of an interesting idea. Dandara is a little rough around the edges, but  pretty unique for a metroidvania style game. Worth checking out.",

      "The Witch's House has been my most favorite RPG Maker horror game for years and now I have the remaster which I can buy to directly support the developer. Needless to say how good it is so I will only talk about what is changed and what still remains.\nThe game is still suspenseful and very atmospheric. Some people may worry that the updated graphic and engine may take that away but trust me it is still there and not going anywhere.\nSome sound effects/dialogues have been changed beside the graphic which I am not against it at all. Still very like the remaster.\nThe control is still the same which is as clunky as before when you are not used to. I think the developers know that and decided to not change it so I won't complain. Just say it out for you to know because the game is very old so the control is still there in the past with many other RPG maker games.\nI very like the new graphic and I think they deserve much more compliments for this. However, I like the weird-big-eye Viola model and her less hair skinny portrait more. It look weird and funny at the same time. The new model makes her more beautiful but the portrait makes her kinda fat (at least to me).\nThe new hard mode is.... hard that all I can say without spoiler.\nI don't know whether or not I should calll this a remake but at least it is done better than DSR. And Small indie developers should be supported more. May be \"Ib\" will be remastered some days too if this game is success\nThump Up!",
      "[I received this product for free from a giveaway]. Only played for a short time, but sheesh, it's a bit of a mess both visually and gameplay wise. There's not much I can really say that would differ from what's shown in the trailer (rather crude MS-paint looking drawings with a few short looping backgrounds). You jump when moving right or left, flappy-bird esque, you dodge stuff going across the screen and from the top, which is a bit boring to me, but some may enjoy it more. You also have to go out of the screen to dodge sometimes, but also if you go too far out (who knows how far) you'll die as well. It might be an okay time waster for free (like old flash games), but I wouldn't recommend spending your money on this.",

With staff, if they near rage quit, just raise their salary.\n\n4. In the early game, only put down the essential objects (e.g. only desk and file cabinet in GP's) to maximize your profit. They only room I recommend to decorate to lvl 5 is staff room to speed up their recovery.\n\n5. ALWAYS ensure there is a toilet right next to your staff room, and a cafe. If a tired staff need bathroom, he/she will walk all the way to the staff room and back to toilet and back to staff room, even if a toilet is right next to his/her office. Samething with Cafe, it provides a 'nice meal' bonus.\n\n6. Do not build more reception than you need, build less. It is a great way to control the patient flow, they don't wonder around while in a reception queue.\n\n7. For a large map, patients entering the hospital from mutiple gates. I don't recommend building reception other than one specific area (preferably right next to GP's office), reason as above.\n\n8. News agent can get long queue very easily, as long as you have one, patients in queue will travel all the way across the map for it. So be careful, either don't put any, or put one in every building (at least).\n\n9. With spare money, get your staff trained ASAP, especially staff providing treatment (to ensure high chance of successful treatment)\n\n10. Click on a room, goes to 'info' tab, the last sentence there will tell you what training the staff in the room should have.\n\n11. Keep track of your staff's skills, and assign them only ONE job in the staff -> job assignment menu, so AI won't mess your system up.)\n\nThings I'd really like to be changed:\n1. WAY too many patients.\nI think the new patients' growth(spawn) need to be slow down at certain point either automatically or mannually, I often found myself in need of double the amount of GP offices in the mid-game. Since GP offices are the choke points, it can get out of control in matter of seconds, which left no Human resources/money/time to train everyone. Besides, it is realistic, there are only so many people a town have.\nAnd because of the growth issue, I find myself have to build more and more, I'd like to slow down and taking care of every corner of my hospital, not just keep building. Quality takes time, nobody like be overly pushed by the game.\n\n2. Rooms merge\nJust like in real lives, Doctor's room are private, but pharmacy? I think other rooms should not be private - Allow us to put multiple machine and people in one room, make it shared. It is just bizzare to not make it shared, and vey wasteful of time/money/spaces. Besides, some room looks really empty.\n\n3. Wards\nWards are weird, I'm not sure why. Often than not, I have more than enough beds and nurses, but still 6+ wait outside, I'm not sure what triggers them to be 'called in'\n\n4. FOOD/DRINK/TOILET is broken\nI'm sorry, but I'm not gonna build cafe & bathroom every 3 inchs. IRL, most hospital have 1~3 cafes, a small~medium toilet on every floor. Space is valuable, I would rather leave it to medical facilities. I think the AI is a bit broken at this point, they constantly want drink/food/bathrooms while I have 6+ machines/2 toilets in every building. As if they can't walk 10m to the nearest one.\n\n5. Janitors are kind of dump.....I wish we can assign areas to janitors/assitances, so they won't always walk across the map back and forth.\n\n6. Man, this is 2018, we got central heating and air-conditioning...for real. Maybe make a seprate tunnel system? Like water, electricity, heat, air. Hospital's air exchange system is much more important than usual buildings I believe.\n\n7. Credit to Ibbi Wyxx in the commnet, I think it is great to set patient with certain percent of diagnosis straight to treatment rooms. It makes sense and later in the game, with doctors fully trained I imagine 100% diagnosis on most patients in the GP's shouldn't be a problem. And it is how real life works as well, dorctors are not always 100% sure whats wrong, they might start some harmless/urgent treatment first, myself actually is in this situation right now \n\n(sometimes I feel like I'm being treated in my own hospital because I just stayed at one IRL, so I have to make everything right as if trying to please myself...)\n\n8.  Some of those skills just look fancy since you can't replace them.\nThis one does not matter much, I'm very OCD when it comes to managment, so atm I have to wait for the right person w/o any skills I don't want on them so the training oppourtinity will not go wasted, but it is hard and annoying. Besides, it is a real problem since you can only learn 5 skills, so just choosing whoever is not effective and effecient in the long run. (for example a GP w/ Radiology skill)\n\nAlso, it makes some of the skill essentially useless, i.e. master class (speed up learning and teaching), it may seem useful, but it will eventually cost you a lot more than you gain. Down the line it will cost you one spot for other skill. If just hiring someone w/ this skill to teach then fire him, it is also costly and not making any real sense. \n\nThings I'd like to see (in DLCs?):\n1. Ambulances management. Ambulance are essential part of a hospital, ERs are even better! (Stayed at a ER bed not long ago watch the whole ER room working,man, ERs are cool af, but I do hope less people need to see it because it is...ER)\n2. Multifloor-hospital.\n3. ICU etc.?\n4. Medicin/drug development/management\n5. Specialists office?\n6. More background music/radio, its a bit repetitive at this point",

      "Falcom's Action RPG Masterpiece.\n\nbest story in the series. it follows the latest adventure of Adol and his companions, stranded in an island and slowly uncovering their secrets. the tight, but well developed cast are absolutely the best written characters in the series. from party member to your fellow castaways all have developed motivation, personality and charm. \n\nalot of the horribad translation and voice acting have been fixed, and it finally got the treatment it deserve as a masterpiece. \n\nthe gameplay is an evolution of the modern Ys game. at its core, ys 8 is an action RPG where you control adol and several other party members with unique set of skills, moveset, weapons and super attack. each character represent an attack type (slash, pierce, smash) that are pitted against various enemies with certain weaknesses. great variety of enemies, amazing boss battles, music and story. \n\non release, there seems to be a big problem for the port, but as far as i know, everything has been patched to very good level of stability. over 70 hours, the game crashed twice (and saved by the intuitive autosave system), run flawlessly 60 FPS and 1440p without a single slowdown. \n\n10/10 game go buy so we get monstrum nox on PC.",
      "It's hard to review a game like this.\n\nAs a game in it's own right, if you've never played it before, it's a good game. Typical crazy Final Fantasy story (although it takes a bit to get into it), interesting characters, and simple but fun real-time turn-based combat. Final Fantasy games are known for their stories and characters, which are great in this member of the series.\n\nIf you've played the game before on PS1, then it's good for nostalgia. However, many people complain about it being a bad port. It has built-in cheats, in case you just want to be able to enjoy the story, characters, and side-quests. I played this years ago on PS1, and I really enjoyed my trip down memory lane with this game.\n\nIf you're an achievement hunter, this game is horrible. There are achievements that, unless you're literally following an online scripted step-by-step walkthrough, you will miss some random little thing, not know it, and then have to play the entire game over. Another achievement requires you to speed through the game in under 12 hours, which means you will grind through the game you already played, watching the same story you just watched, all over again, wasting six hours (that's how long it took me), just for the sake of one achievement... There's also another achievement to kill 10k enemies. when you can play the whole game and not even kill 1k enemies... You might think, \"oh they just want you to play the game through 10 times then\". No. It's 10k enemies in one playthrough. You run out of content, and have nothing to do, except grind battles, for literally dozens of hours. It's terrible.\n\nDespite my bitterness about the achievements, it's a really enjoyable game. Considering the FF series are mainly known for their stories, it lives up to its reputation. If you're an RPG fan, this is definitely on the list of \"must plays\".",

      "i don't think i liked it :(\n\na richly illustrated nightmare fairy tale which warns of paranoid infighting and reaching for an unattainable ideal, broken apart by tedious and artificially difficult survival horror segments. i meet each hazard as intended and am often punished with unforgiving damage or by being taken to an instant game over, and while i fully accept that this very well might just be a skill issue on my part, it remains a significant hurdle that's barring me from engaging properly with the unfolding narrative.\n\ni'm not unfamiliar with the death-laden rpgmaker horror-esque titles which preceded LGTS and those it draws its inspirations from, its how it contextualises such flaws that becomes an issue. there are no \"skip seen dialogue\" options, with the fast forward made available to us after Elise's delayed inputs just slow enough to be annoying. on that note, bosses with instant death attacks have unskippable cutscenes prior making repeat attempts patronising. two core survival systems are made redundant within one of the in-game days. perhaps most tragically, the distinct visual style which once pleased the eye beings to blend into monotony and goes unappreciated after some hours.\n\nand like i'm sad about it! i wanted to like it! i really enjoyed how the story progressed and how my bond with my favourite lady bloomed and i liked the endings i've managed to get, but all these hiccups had me nearly just uninstalling early. it's a beautiful poetic horror title, but so many little things simply ended up overwhelming me.",

Very satisfying build making, with solid build variety. Has couch co-op which is very nice. It has some beautiful pixel art, truly. This game is a feast for the eyes and ears with cutscenes, voice acting, and more. Ok, I just love this game. It's so damn good.",

But I  can honestly say, that this one is one of the few (if not the only one) that truly deserves that tag.\nIt gives you the feel of those 2d metroid and castlevania games, but with a lot of little tweaks that brings that play style to the new era of gamming.\nTo make this whole thing even more amazing, this game was made by just one man. And the love this guy put on this game is amazing, you can really feel it and it's speacially clear when you look at all the atention every little detail of this game had. Also the dev is very active on the forum, and will help you out with any technical issue you're having.\n\nAmazing art, amazing gameplay and a lot of replayability.

      "A criminally underrated game, I have seldom seen a developer take their original hit which was already almost perfect, and actually manage to improve on it in every way shape and form. You do not need to have played the original to play or enjoy this game. Their stories are completely seperate.\n\nThe game itself is much less linear than its predecessor. The best way I can explain the feeling of going through the environments without referencing Grimrock itself is by saying it felt an awful lot like Myst to me, just with combat. Required puzzles for progression were challenging but not impossible, some of the secret challenges were much more difficult. I admit I used an online guide more than a few times, but it did nothing to diminish my enjoyment of the game. It is immersive, challenging, and satisfying. \n\nThe only drawback I can think of is the difficulty. It feels like you cannot win with any group composition, I suggest no more than 2 of any class or weapon/armor type user. I went with a warrior, two rogues(one range), and a mage, this way you as well makes you unlikely to complete a difficult fight or puzzle and be rewarded with something you cannot use. Combat itself can be challenging as I said, but you will rarely feel like you are simply incapable of winning. There are obvious ways to optimize the way you approach an encounter the second time if you die the first.\n\nBe prepared to immerse yourself, you must pay attention to your surroundings, read and remember notes you find, explore every nook and cranny you can find, and you will be rewarded. Good luck!\n",

      "[h1] Too much for too little? [/h1]\nThe game hovers over/under an hour (depending on your pace) and there really isn't much in terms of replayability....besides going through it again or trying to obtain all the achievements (which aren't challenging), this at most would add a couple more hours.So in short you don't get much content for the price tag, with that said what you do get is quality.... a lot of it, ranging from the art to the music and everything in between. Now with that in mind, I believe that if the lack of content hinders you too much wait for a sale, but if not go ahead and pick it up you probably won't regret it. \n[h1] What's inside? [/h1]\nStory is very straightforward without much depth behind it, but that's not necessarly a bad thing... at least when it comes to this game. What makes an otherwise simple plot into something much more enticing is how everything like the art style, music, flow from one scene to the next and especially the interactions complement one another in order to create a sense of immersion w/everything that comes with that feeling. \n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\nI highly recommend this game for anyone with feeeels and without. It's short, but as they say it \"packs a punch\".",
      "I appreciate the sincerity of Jusant. You can tell its creators have placed genuine care into their product, which has made the experience of playing it joyful and kind.\nThe visuals are stunning, the mechanics are not overwhelming, the soundtrack is soothing, and the puzzles are not frustrating.

      "Only one word to describe this game\n\nOutdated.\n\nThere is no real point to get this game unless you want a slightly better looking UI and atmosphere. L4D2 already contains the campaigns from L4D1 and is where the entire Left 4 Dead community is. Only a small playerbase still plays l4d1, mostly out of nostalgia. But there is quite literally no reason to get the game.\n\nYou can grab it if you are into achievements, but only do so when it goes on sale, i grabbed it for a couple penny, still a bad idea.",
      "Overall its a great hunting game. The base game is good enough on its own to give you an enjoyable experience hunting several varieties of animals. \n\nI feel that some of the best content is in the DLC's. I dont mind the price tag for maps are they are just a large and some of them have a truly diverse animal population. \n\nThe Weapon Packs have some items that really should have been available in the base game (.22 rifle).\nTripod stands, Tents and ATV's are also DLC items that i feel should have been included in the base game. \n\nThe cost for these packs are not huge, and I have bought them, but they really do impact your play in a meaningful way so it is hard not feel like they were left out on purpose. \n\nBeing a former hunter in real life I would say that the realism of it is pretty good. Lung shots and heart shots drop animals quickly and using the right ammo along with good aim greatly influences this. A poor shot will leave you tracking this wounded animal across the map till you sneak up on it again or just give up. \n\nThey have a system called Tru Racks (sumthn like that) that simulates different qualities of animals. So you end up with little bucks, average bucks, and monster bucks. Weight and coloration plays a part in this too. In short every animal has a trophy of some kind and they are varied by what must be some sort of RNG. \n\nAll that having been said, this game can devolve into a shooting gallery were you kill everything on sight as there in no real incentive not to. You get money and experience for every kill you claim and wiping out a heard of deer with your DLC M1 Garand on your DLC Tripod Stand becomes the quickest way to bypass the grind.\n\n It feels like the game starts as a \"hunting sim\" and becomes a \"poaching sim\" once you realize the progression system is going to take a long time to do...\"ethically?\".\n\n\nAgain, this is a game i would recommend, but it is just that, a game. \n\n",
      "I hated Undertale.\n\nIt was, pretty clearly, a game about sexy skeletons. I did not care about sexy skeletons. I refused to play a game about sexy skeletons.\n\nThen my friend made me listen to the soundtrack, and I decided I could deal with a few hours of sexy skeletons if I got to listen to the best video game music I had ever heard while doing it. \n\nI played Undertale. It's not a game about sexy skeletons. It's a game about choices, maybe, or morality, or curiosity. It's a game about pushing the limits. It's a game about experiences, about \"what would happen if I did this?\", about storytelling so intricate and complex and raw that it shouldn't be able to fit into seven hours of bullet hell and pixel graphics. But, somehow, it does. Every choice you make has an impact. Every object you check has a story. The soundtrack, the witty yet profound writing, the simple pixel graphics, and even the menu screens and bullet patterns themselves all intertwine in order to tell a story that only you decide the ending of.\n\nAlso, the skeletons aren't even sexy.\n\nMy advice to you: Go in as blind as you can. Don't read walkthroughs. Don't watch playthroughs. Don't prepare yourself. Don't even look at overviews. Hell, don't even read the Steam page description. Just buy the game (and give some well-earned money to a little white dog), and, as it were, climb the mountain yourself. Don't let anyone backseat. Don't listen to people who tell you there's a right way to play.\n\nAnd when you think you've reached the end, just think--what other choices could you have made?\n\nSo, yes.

      "I am a Filthy Casual (tm) who plays games like Mass Effect and Fallout 4 on easy and still die over and over.

I have rage quit every single platformer game I have ever touched, and just sort of despise brutally hard things that feel like chores.\n\nBasically, I am not exactly sure why I decided to buy Dead Cells in the first place. Sure, I love the look and one of the few platformers I've ever 100%'d was Super Metroid (with a LOT of swearing and rage quitting), so 'Metroidvania' is an appealing term to me, but it is still inherently marketed as a game that is not for me, or people like me.\n\nThis game is hard. I have 11 hours on it and I can't get past the third area on any given path. I die for stupid reasons and lose all my stuff and... I don't care. I haven't rage quit once; in fact, I have to force myself away from the game after a death so I can do things like eat. I find the combat engaging and entertaining, the progression satisfying and there's something really solid about being forced to start from square one (ish) every single time, in a way I've just never experienced.\n\nSo, sure, buy this if you love hard games/Dark Souls/no checkpoint kind of games. Absolutely, I'm pretty sure you've alreeady heard this is likely to be up your alley.\n\nBut even if you're a dirty rotten casual gamer who button smashes in any game approaching action, and panics when the screen flashes red around the edges... give it a try if you get the opportunity.

      "Steam, for gods sake, give us a neutral recommendation button.\n\nSooo, long story short, the game is nice and has beautifull artwork. It´s also massivly too short. This are the only objective things I can say about it. \n\nNow to be a bit more real here. I bought this game, because I played another game like this, let´s call it \"Blue Sticks Bar\". And that game hooked me into this genre.\nNormally I´m someone who likes extensive interaction with a Games Story more than anything else. For this reason I hated TTG and similar stuff. But that Barkeeping game had such a complex Story and such good Characters that I fell in love with it and by extension the Genre.\n\nSo I got myself Coffee Talk. And boy oh boy let me tell ya, I´m seriously torn with this game. Partway through I thought I would give it a searing bad review. But then I played through it and noticed something. This game isn´t bad, just painfully average. And, I hate to say this, but I´m probably too mature for it.\n\nNow don´t get me wrong.\nSome things here are just wonderfull. The Artstyle? Fantastic (exept for a couple minor things)\nI´m guessing the music is also good if you like it.\n\nBut already there are cracks there. Something (mildly) dramatic is happening and some coffee house tunes are playing in the Background. It´s honestly just laughable.\nAnd that word is a great segway into talking about the Story. You know that moment when you´re browsing and find (mostly on Tumblr) some really cute little story idea? This is that the game. Problem is, that a Story that deals with, for example racism, growing up, PTSD and some other really serious matters can´t be as shallow as this.\n\nYou have to decide. Either you´re doing Babies first social awareness Storyline and leave out some of this stuff, OR you do a real mature story that I can´t sum up in one single sentence.\n\nI really want to like this Game. I´m a lonely little Geek, so a Story about interesting People in a Shadowrun-light Setting sounded right up my alley.

The only reason I stopped playing was because there was a fence that wasn't fully secured to the ground that I was able to get underneath, allowing me to get out of bounds. This lead to me falling into an area where I couldn't get out, and it wouldn't let me respawn at my most recent checkpoint. This would mean I'd have to start from the beginning, which I very much didn't want to do. Anyway, the biggest tips I can give to the developers is to make sure the map is 100% how they want it, and to make the audio design better. That's it.

      "This game is adrenaline, speed and acid to the absolute maximum and it delivers - you'll be doing exactly what you see in the trailers in absolutely no time and feeling like a badass!\n\nWe have all the menu, leaderboards and replay system as in Devil Daggers along with a new clips section for highlights from runs. \nThe new scoring system is a HUGE improvement. In DD you had to survive as long as possible leading to it becoming repetitive as you grinded, here the score is based on how fast you can kill stuff and there is an ending to the run meaning you might survive to the end and kill the boss - but someone else could beat your score by killing stuff faster in the first min and then dying. \nThis adds loads more risk to the game as you WANT to take those risks to kill stuff faster.\n\nOnly let down is the controls, the simple control scheme worked in Devil daggers as there wasn't much going on but it REALLY hurts now theres so many new mechanics causing both a lot of unintended actions like with RMB is your laser and you can scatter this off the ground or like you see in the trailers shoot the gems for your homing daggers trouble is RMB is also grab meaning if you look at a gem and start to power your laser you simple pick up the gem and no laser huge momentum loss. Likewise spacebar is jump, dash, slide, fake and air slam this not only leads to awkward \"thats not what i wanted\" moments but also cramps my hand since you are constantly spamming for dash which is 2 presses...\n\nIf the controls dont bother you or get some love this game is easily a 10/10.",

      "Everything apart from the matches is superb, best FM ever. \n\nThe match engine is fundamentally broken - too easy to split a defence open with a long ball resulting in a one-on-one, so SI nerfed the conversion rates of one-on-one chances to keep scorelines acceptable. The result however, is that your world class  striker misses 2-5 easy chances every game. \n\nWingers do not square the ball for strikers, instead preferring to shoot from obscenely acute angles rather than play the ball across the box. \n\nHalf the crowd is a repeated man in an orange jumper. This may sound minor but it's really immersion breaking once you notice it. You can be a team that plays in blue, and yet over 50% of the crowd are dressed in orange. It diminishes the match experience and detracts from the game as a whole.\n\nIt's crap like this, broken for 2 months now, I've bought every game in this series since the year 2000, I pre-order every year (literally the only game I will do so with) and said I'll continue to do so until I get burned.

      "An Excelent, well polished shmup(except for one technical fault) with great graphics and music.\n\nNot much to say other than it has fun boss fights with some creative bullet patterns, you have a gauge that fills up and when activated it doubles your fire power, and also you have bombs. If you have bombs and you get hit, you lose all of your bombs instead of just dying straight out, so you essentially have 2 hit points. You have a graze meter as well, meaning that if bullets pass by you it fills that meter up, when it is full, all bullets around you are basically nullified, and any enemy you kill, any bullets it fired at you will also get nullified.

      "So, I hated this game at first...\n\n I've never been into a MMO before, and I went into it with a mindset of \"FUCK YEAH! MULTIPLAYER SKYRIM LETS GO\" - In short don't do that. This isn't going to be like playing Skyrim, Oblivion, Morrowind. \n\nIt is when it all comes down to the core an MMO, it's set in Tamriel, it sounds like Tamriel and the storylines feel like an Elder Scrolls game. However being an MMO, it has a lot of grindy MMO style quests. And don't get me wrong, it's bewildering at first, all these mechanics, all these places to go....and before the 'One Tamriel' update if you chose the wrong faction, you were screwed, in a place all on your own surrounded by all these people who are WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY higher level than you. But thankfully they changed all of that. The game scales now, so you can rock up to a dungeon with your level V300 mate, and still have some fun slicing up enemies.\n\nSo I saw a friend playing the other day, and spent a few hours installing this to join him (By the way its like 70 Gig...If you have slow internet prepare for a few days of download), I got back on it after not playing for 14 months, but this time I was playing with a friend who was already Veteran Level 250, So I was in luck, he introduced me to everything and I got used to all the deconstructing of equipment to get my blacksmithing up, showed me about dungeons and bascially got me to enjoy the grind. I think my previous time was a bit lackluster because I got dropped in the middle of the Aldmeri Dominion on my own, without any of my friends. So I left.\n\nNow I know what I'm doing, and keep in mind I usually hate MMO's never played WoW or anything like that, this is the first one. I'm enjoying myself, I'm triple digits into this game time-wise and I don't see it stopping now. We've made a guild for noobies. To help them out, and get them to enjoy the game also. Because the community is nice...but you still get the elitist fucks from any competitive game kicking you out of dungeons because you're only level 14. But you won't get that when you're in a guild, having people to play with and explain all the mechanics did help, a lot. I've even gone as far as to buy this AGAIN on steam just to collect my hours and so on.\n\nAdd-ons are awesome being able to mod basic features of the game to help with information and quality of life improvements is a must. I'll provide an essential mods pack if any of you wish to know.\n\nFor those of you who actually got this far into this, well done. I didn't think I'd keep you captivated long enough to get to the end.\n\nIf any of you are new to the game, on EU server and would like to join a guild to show you the way, add me or visit our [url=www.godsofsalt.com]website[/url] and join us on teamspeak, or just message us in game @diseasedcrow.\n\nBut all in all if you like Elder Scrolls and you think you want to try this, just do, I'm glad I gave it a second chance.",
      "Not really that great of a game. It's fairly unengaging, very slow paced, impossible boss fights just a few hours in. Unless you like games that requre hours of picking plants to craft potions you rub on your sword to give you 3 minutes of attack boost to be able to do any damage, side quest grinding, boring activites, and the general RPG stat grinding, skip this one and just get the Witcher 3 which is a game magnitudes better. CD Projeck Red really made the Witcher and Withcer 2 for the hardcore RPG fans. The experience just isn't worth the time investment on this one in my opinion. Not going to finish it and just go enjoy the third game instead.\n\nEDIT: \nTR;DR: A mediocre hack-n-slash that has been dummed down from the predeccesor for consoles.",

      "[h1] Brief summary of why the Chinese players are so pissed: [/h1]\n\nThe reason for the chinese players to absolutely despise the third party modding website is that the \"official modding\" was promised to be released over a year ago, but kept getting delayed. When it finally got released, everyone felt betrayed because it was a garbage third party website with so many restrictions.\n\nBut the reason why the game is still getting review bombed is the [b] developer's initial response [/b] to the first round of complaints. The team was dead silent for about 2 weeks, no comments about all the fiasco, yet people that were complaining about the modding on the chinese forums got their accounts banned left and right. Thats why many resorted to steam review bombing, and almost as soon as the steam review tanked, the developer came out and said the steam workshop will be launching in the end of the month, something he had being saying was \"really hard for the team\" and kept \"facing difficulties\" for the past year.\n\nSo yeah.... I kinda understand why people are still really mad about this one",

      "From my nine year old: \"We like that every screen you can stop and color, and if you don't want to color there is a story part to it. We really like to do both; there are puzzles, different colors and different sections. I would definitely recommend this game for five and up year olds.\"",
      "This was released alongside about 10 other big Steam releases around the end of October 2022 and so it is very tempting to joke about how it's better than all of those combined, the real GOTY so on and so forth, as I'm sure has been done already. But what I noticed was that out of all those releases, this one had an emphasis on comedy, which is very difficult to execute successfully in any form of media. There is no voice acting or any high-budget production so how the dialogue and seemingly basic visuals/animations kept me entertained throughout, just like the previous 2 games (from memory) is a tremendous achievement. At a point where I have played a bazillion high-budget action games, and will honestly play a bazillion more, games like this only become more important in showcasing how creative independence is imperative in creating uplifting experiences.\nAfter the prologue, seeing Frog Detective step out of the train and the camera pausing on his full-body shot was akin to, say, if I saw Shepherd step out of the Normany in ME4, or if I saw Keanu step out of a train in John Wick 4, it was really on that level for me.\nThough, I feel like the dance scenes at the end of this game was a step-down from Frog Detective 2 unfortunately, but still good.\n\nEdit: I nominated this game for 'Outstanding Visual Style' Steam Award!",
      "Overall, as a single player game Wargroove 2 is a tremendous improvement over the first game. The campaign is well designed and engaging, the writing is much improved and overall the gameplay is fun. The new roguelike conquest mode is a much more entertaining side thing than the godawful Arcade in 1, as well.\n\nAs a primary single player game, I hated Wargroove 1, and I can say that 2 has turned my opinion around - this game is fun, I finished the campaign and craved more, which is all you can really say! The only thing I really missed from 1 was the Puzzle mode, but maybe it'll show up in a future update? Who knows.\n\nThe major downsides is that the user interface is still the same terrible user interface that WG1 had without significant improvements, and the AI is still absolutely atrocious so playing even Vs maps against the AI is going to be pretty dull, but that hasn't changed from the first game. The soundtrack is not quite as catchy either.\n\nBut unlike WG1, I enjoyed my time with WG2 in spite of these shortcomings, and if you ever have a choice between the two, skip WG1 and just go straight into WG2.",

      "In 2013, after 10 years of waiting, the Sim City community of modders, fans, and aficionados rushed out to purchase the fifth installment of Sim City. Ten years is a long time to wait for a game, but people had a lot of faith in Maxis when they announced the title. Long story short, it was a massive dissapointment. Maxis and EA crippled Sim City 5 with DRM, Always On APM, tiny maps, forced origin installation, lacking mod support, no steam support, and a forced multiplayer aspect.  I decided to not purchase the title, so it may have been a decent game, but 2 years later a team of 12 people created a game that does everything maxis insisted was utterly and totaly impossible.  \n\nEverything the mod community did that kept Sim City 4 on the shelves in Wallmarts across America for an entire decade was ignored. Maxis (and to a lesser extent EA) ignored the fans, and gave the people who had kept them in business for twenty years a crippled subpar game.  And for that Maxis is now out of business. They will never make another game, and it is no one's fault but theirs.\n\nNow pretend none of that happened. It's 2013 again, and here it is people: Sim City 5. \n\nThe game balance is a bit on the easy side for veterans of the genre, but the potential map size is ENOURMOUS and customizing your city could fill up years of gameplay time.  The game runs so smoothly with so much going on, it really shows how lazy Maxis was with their approach.  The glass in buildings reflects the sun and the buildings near it, there are dynamic shadows, zoning is back, and it is not 'dumbed down'.  A single tile in this game is twice the size of the alloted map in Sim City, and you can purchase dozens of additional tiles to expand.  The map editor is awesome, the community is thriving, there are mods to do anything you want, and this is the city building game we've all been waiting for.  I can not possibly reccomend this more.",

If you have bombs and you get hit, you lose all of your bombs instead of just dying straight out, so you essentially have 2 hit points. You have a graze meter as well, meaning that if bullets pass by you it fills that meter up, when it is full, all bullets around you are basically nullified, and any enemy you kill, any bullets it fired at you will also get nullified. When you pass through the nullifeid bullets, it will fill the first gauge I mentioned so you can go ape s**t more often.\n\nIt's fairly simple, but the pace of the game takes a little while to get used to, the speed of your ship releative to the bullets is a little too slow but it's not game breaking.

      "Nobody is gonna read this but here we go.... \nI recommend it, especially people who are really into classic Sonic. It plays like the Genesis games and is updated to incorporate elements and stages from each one, including Sonic CD. What it makes up for in updated graphics, music, and ideas, it loses in length of stage and just overall.... stage design. What I loved about the classic Sonic is that it felt like a choice to either blow through it or explore.. this one makes even the first level of each stage take about 5 or 6 minutes to get through... and then fight a boss. Overkill in my opinion, takes away what I liked about classic Sonic games... the speed. Still pretty good considering how much Sega has messed with Sonic throughout the years.",

      "I love this game so much, but I am very conflicted about it. Since the beta I wondered why mods on the mod page on the Chucklefish website were sometimes incorporated into the base game and now I know why.\n\nThe devs of this game ultimately have amazing talent behind them, but they've exploited those they've called \"volunteer developers\". Promising \"exposure\" as a form of payment, and ultimately delivering neither payment, or giving their \"volunteers\" a spotlight on their own steam page or website. \n\nStill, you and I'd both buy nestle products even if they were made by child laborers, Nike shoes made by sweatshop workers, and beauty cosmetics that harm animals and even harm us when we use them. Even making the most *perfect* product doesn't make you immune to criticism for gross business practices.\n\nStarbound is a fantastic game, with incredible mod support, a fantastic soundtrack, and just all around an amazing game even if it does have shoddy server support. It's essentially Terraria in space with a more engaging visual and music style yet shallower combat. It's much easier to approach than Terraria, without as much content. Still, I absolutely enjoy this game over Terraria.\n\nI love this game, but dislike the people who made this game. It took me a while to write this because I wanted to see if the devs would make up for their disregard for their \"volunteers\". They did not.",

But then, the real remaster, the Definitive Edition, you start playing the game and it FEELS like it used to feel. Like it is supposed to look. It is quite obviously way better than it used to be, but it FEELS the same.\n\nIf you ever liked playing this game, and want to play it again, this won't disappoint you.

HOWEVER, if you enjoy the detective aspect, the puzzles, the mental challenge, this game is probably not for you.\n\nThe gameplay is a big departure compared to Her Story and Telling Lies, and in my opinion, doesn't make for much of a challenge at all. In the 10 hours I spent on the game, 9 were just me watching clips and clicking random objects in the background. I found the actual movie stuff to be really fun (and especially seeing the process of how movies are made), but that kind of fun is very different to the kind I had with the previous two games.\n\nI don't dislike the game but I don't recommend it either, at least to a decent chunk of the fanbase (those being fans of detective puzzle games).",

But Psychonauts 2 understands that human beings aren't defined by any of this, and that people can learn from their wrongs and can change for the better. And it tells all this through a delicious array of gorgeous, varied mental landscapes, through creative collectibles that reveal the memories, loves, and regrets of the colorful cast, and through a combat and platforming system that is much improved from its predecessor. I can't recommend this game enough. It's an emotional triumph.",
      "It's hard to recommend Spelunky 2. Not because it is a bad game, but because it can be frustrating. As with most roguelikes, dying means going back to the beginning. In Spelunky however, nothing carries over to future runs. All you get to bring in to your next run is your own experience and knowledge; And when half the things in the game kill you instantly or stunlock you to death, having a great run end in a quick death can be damaging to one's will.\n\nThankfully, your own experiences count a great deal towards your progress. Most hazards and enemies in Spelunky 2 have a very simple and predictable behaviour. But keeping track of everything on the screen is still a challenge. Enemies and traps will also work together (or against each other) and still bring your demise somehow. Either by bumping your helplessly stunned body into other enemies and traps, or enemies having their own flaming corpse launched towards you and your flammable jetpack. It's actually quite funny sometimes. A good deal of entertainment can be had recording your own amazingly nonsensical deaths.\n\nSpelunky 2 improves upon Spelunky HD's gameplay by adding split paths, which allow for more variety and decision-making in your runs while staying true to the feeling and style of previous entries. It also adds a back layer to each level, allowing for more secrets to be kept. After successfully completing your first run, you can try to discover these secrets and find hidden bosses and areas and even different endings!\n\nAnyway, you might enjoy the game if you're a masochist or something.",

Still pretty solid dlc if you are a fan and want a little bit of extra stuff :)",

Love as a path to growth.\n\nIt's almost perplexing how they manage to make it all work, it's structurally among the most ambitious tales I've ever witnessed in video games, but they do, it does work, the missteps are few, the memories of it all absolutely enchanting.\n\nIt wouldn't have worked without the astonishing soundtrack.

Yeeeeee-no.\n\n[H1]So it's the Bullet Hell version of Destiny?[/H1]\n\nMechanically, it works great. You have a ship with a teeny tiny hitbox, same as most \"Eastern\" BHell games, you have anywhere between \"Mildly offensive\" and \"Absolutely terrifying\" levels of hostile fire coming toward you, and you pump out similarly scary levels of fire back, with your only choice generally being \"Do I spam the screen with lots of little beams or do I fire ONE BIG BEAM at something that needs cracking open like a walnut.\"\n\nIt has good Bullet Hell music, albeit not outstanding music, it has good graphics, albeit not outstanding graphics, you see a pattern here? If a game could ever nail what I'd define as the absolute essence of an \"8 out of 10\", this would be it. The problem is there's games out there such as Revolver360 Re:Actor that do -better-.\n\nThe problem is that for all the good it does, it's been beaten to it by other games, maybe not in every field, but in each area I can name at least two or three games that stand above it. The one area it does win out on is bang for the buck. It's kinda hard to argue with this kind of quality at this kind of price point. It's a very, very solid return on investment, particularly if you're a bullet hell fan.\n\n[H1]Closing Thoughts[/H1]\n\nDoes that make this a \"Do not buy\"? Far from it. If you're a fan of bullet hells, chances are you already own it. If you don't, eventually you should, but I'd genuinely suggest you look around first, there's a decent market now on Steam for this genre, and there's more innovative and interesting options around. If however you've already consumed them and you need a fix of something fairly solid and fairly entertaining, then sure, this works, it will scratch the itch quite nicely.\n\nVerdict : [b]Buy, definitely worth grabbing on a sale, if only to put in the \"To do\" list,[/b]"

Proving that the game is stale. Proving that the game is a gimmick and people are thumb upping in hopes of a good game.\n\nThis game is trash.\n\nTo the guy making fun of me pointing out that there are more hours played after posting my review, NOW WHAT BICH?? I DON'T PLAY THIS TRASH, WHY? BECAUSE IT IS A CRAP GAME , what you got to say now huh boy?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOriginal review -\n\nWOW, you can sell incomplete crap like this, really?\n\nOK: 3 levels.... and level 4 comes at the end of the year.\nI'm leveling a character... for what??\n\n\nto all you thumb uppers.... I'm asking- I'm leveling a character for what? How dare you thumbs up. I got fooled and thought this is good, now I feel robbed.\n\nDo you want to feel robbed??????\nIt doesn't feel good....\n\nThere are only 3 short levels.....\nWhat kind of rpg is 3 levels?\n\n\nI think something needs to be done to clean up scum like this. This, donate me crap..... needs to go on kickstarter, gofundme, not on the steam marketplace. Because you showed yourself as a real game, but what did I really buy? Level 4 comes out in 1 year.... I'll tell you 10 levels wouldn't nearly be enough!!!\n\nTHE NEXT LEVEL, LEVEL 4 COMES OUT AT THE END s\\OF THE YEAR- 10 LEVELS WOULD NOT NEARLY BE ENOUGH TO MAKE THIS A GAME! WHAT AM I GRINDING FOR, LEVELING WHAT FOR WHAT???? U THIEVES!!!!!\n\n-UPDATE - Beat elite mode on first time trying, beat nightmare mode on second time trying. Game is nothing, no voice actors, no real point in the game, and stupid broken mechanics. Get all psyched about scrolls and ascension to build a nice character? Then realize how broken the 20k damage per shot is, there really isn't any fine tuning in the game. The game has NO CONTENT- WOW 4 LEVELS AND a CAMPAIGN FOR \"FULL RELEASE\" I WILL REMEMBER THIS DEVELOPER AND BE WARY!!!\n\nDO NOT BUY\n\nDO NOT BUY\nDO NOT BUY\n\nDO NOT SUPPORT\n\nDO NOT BUY\n\nIF YOU THUMBS UP- YOU HAVE BEEN FOOLED! OPEN YOUR EYES TO THE RATE OF RELEASES - WHAT IS ACTUALLY RELEASED- NO VOICE ACTORS- BROKEN MATH FOR THE GAME SYSTEM- \nTHIS WAS ADVERTISED AS LIKE BORDERLANDS- IT IS NOT EVEN %1 OF THE CONTENT OF BORDERLANDS FOR %50 OF THE PRICE OF BORDERLANDS 3!!!\n\nThis game is $10, peoples' stupid thumb up reviews saying to buy this if it's on sale.....\n\nBORDERLANDS 3 IS $20 WTH DID YOU SUGGEST ME TO BUY YOU IDIOTS!!! \n\n3 levels- with level 4 at the end of the year and labeled as full release- stupid.\n- And I PRE ORDERED this hahahhhahah\n- Disclaimer: This is review from player who prefer story-rich game and haven't played any game by Arkhouse Telegraph.\n\nThe good:\n+ Outstanding 80's-esque visual pixel artstyle. It reminds me of few SNES/Atari/Gameboy games.\n+ Fairly good soundtrack.\n+ Some cutscene/area have fascinating atmosphere.\n+ Run well with Steam proton, so it's likely this game is playable for Linux/Steam Deck user. Although the platformer area might show too many small detail for 7\" display.\n+ Game OST/artbook is available for free on Arkhouse website.\n\nThe bad:\n- While i understand nature of this game require player to find out most thing and go through trial-and-error, some parts definitely need to be explained better. I refer to lack of autosave (for most part of the game), not letting player know about manual save (you can do it by head left after exit for cylinder elevator until you see display/sign \"< S\" and suggestion to visit block H (where you get some guidance).\n- While the manual say i can play R. U. N. E. 3000 first, i have hard time understanding the story and lore/world building. Conversation such as \"DO? DORODO!\" is mostly gibberish and i only can make vague guess based on few specific term (\"V2\", \"50/50\", etc.) and area i've visited. Short recap of previous games (even it's on the manual) could be really helpful for newcomers.\n\nThe ugly:\n* I experience a bug where i fight boss i'm not supposed to fight yet. In detail, [spoiler] after i exit from P block to get symbol cracking code, i was thrown to G block where i fight G-Cat/10th boss. The worst part is the boss HP bar started with red color and auto 3-60 cannon never perform attack. Fortunately the bug doesn't occur again after i load from manual save.  [/spoiler].\n* The gameplay variation/idea is very interesting, but the execution is mixed bags (more explanation on below paragraph)\n\nSaturn Quest: R. U. N. E. 3000 has lots of gameplay variant/modes (Adventure, Shoot'em up, Platformer and many more) to keep the game fresh. While each area/boss have different reason why it's challenging/difficult, many of those is very unbalanced. For example, [spoiler] Bioplatus M-3D/6th boss [/spoiler] require you to have extraordinary eye-hand coordination and multitasking skill. Among all enemy that resemble boss fight, i only managed to beat 6-7 boss without using cheat.\n\nThis game also has very few checkpoint on each area/boss. On adventure/platformer area, you could restart from beginning after spending 10-20 minutes where you have to avoid same trap or collect same item again. On boss fight, that means you'll need to repeat whole fight most of the time. It's could be annoying because since you're forced to find out boss behavior the hard way or repeating tedious part of the fight.\n\n3 HP and lack of difficulty option could be irritating for most modern player. There are time when i found out i only lose 3-10 HP when i use cheat and beat the boss. If there's easier difficulty where i have 6-10 HP, i could beat more boss by myself. But don't get me wrong, i feel really satisfied each time i beat boss (which i deemed can be beaten with practical amount of effort) without cheat. If the developer bother add easy difficulty which has higher player HP, give more Nana and slightly lower boss HP, far more people could enjoy this unique piece of artwork.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nWhile i have some rant, it's really unique experience even though i've played few hundred games. In overall, i have more positive sentiment than negative sentiment of this game. But even though i choose \"Yes\" when Steam ask \"Do you recommend this game?\", i'd rather choose \"Neutral\" or \"Information\" instead. If you're fan of 80's game or really like difficult game, you might come to like this game. But for most people, i'd recommend you to seek other game. Although if you really insist to play this game, you could use Cheat Engine and modify HP/Nana using value type Double (also called float64 or 8-byte float).\n\nP.S. I definitely will play the sequel (Episode IV-VI: White Meteor Saga according to the artbook) [b]IF[/b] the developer bother add easy difficulty option and more checkpoint during boss fight/exploration.\n- I've been completely in love with this game ever since the Mojam prototype \"Wasteland Kings\" was released. It's an insanely fun, fastpaced \"roguelike-like\" or \"roguelite\" with randomly generated worlds and tons of weapons to find. On top of that, the developers stream the development of the game on tuesdays and thursdays over at Twitch and they release updates to the game every week. To me, this is the best game of its kind and I've put tons of hours into mastering it (and I still die. Often. It's difficult okay?).\n- Little over three hours in; Familar puzzles are back, traps are back, backtracking and exploring (in a fun way) is back, trying not to shit yourself while you run through a hallway to conserve ammo as several giant things try to kill you is back, ridiculous humor mixed with gameplay is back, classic Resident Evil storytelling is back...\n\nWelcome Back Resident Evil, you were missed.\n\nEdit: I cheered at the end, and almost woke my wife and son up at six in the morning. I'm glad I avoided the spoilers. \n\nWelcome back [Redacted] and [Redacted], I'll be waiting for the free DLC.\n- I have played OSU!, Muse Dash and stepmania plenty and I gotta say that this does not feel like a rhythm game at all. The premise of matching the shape of the map to music sounds interesting but some of the songs I feel like are not mapped out correctly. Or in general this game relies less on music cues and more on visual cues? It felt like maps are only 50% related to the song and you have to ignore what you hear because the map randomly demands patterns that have no matching audio equivalent and everything becomes pure visual memorization.\n- Hoooh boy, this game sneaks up on you! It seems like any other chill little puzzle game at first. You're enjoying how it tickles the logical part of your brain and maybe even start to feel a little cocky after you've understood the mechanics, like you've outsmarted the game because you've figured out where the enemies are and beat the king for the first time... \n\n...and suddenly it's past midnight. You just nuked every enemy on the map with one attack, jumping in and out of the shadows on a pacifist run or chaining perfectly planned combos for zero energy while thinking \"just one more round, I was so close to getting the king on the highest difficulty!!\"\n\nThe music is well balanced to keep it exciting while not ruining your focus.\nThe art has a handcrafted quality, is easy on the eyes and is cute (even as the enemies turn to skeletons!).\nThe gameplay is easy to get into even for a dumb-dumb like me. It's fun but challenging and I find myself coming back for more even after clearing it all!\n\nOver all, I give this game a 2.75 out of 2.8! (My cat came up with the scoring system, please don't tease him he is very self-conscious about it).\n- I played the F*CK out of RE4 back in the day.. I was sooo hyped for this but its just not RE4.. I get it's a remake but it's not a good one. Which sucks because I LOVED the RE2 remake.. Idk. Maybe it's just me but I cannot recommend this if you loved the original. Maybe newcomers will like it.\n\nEdit after 18 more hours: the original is still better but this remake is not bad. I can recommend it.\n- I did everything right[spoiler]and ended up in a relationship.[/spoiler]\n\nAccidently said one tiny lie.\n\nEverything in my life crumbles apart.\n\n11/10 Real Life Simulator\n- Volition ups the silly, and adds super powers, but loses a little something along the way.\n\nI loved Saint's Row: the Third, and by all rights should have loved IV as well, but I mostly just liked it. The set up was fun, and seemed to up the ante again, but then you get the presidency ripped away from you almost immediately (without even seeing the consequences of your first pushed legislation!). Placing the game in a virtual city for the most part with the only real characters being on your space ship, really kinda seemed to gut the game. Even when [spoiler]the world gets destroyed[/spoiler], a detached, \"meh\" was all I could muster. The humor is there, but it's mostly better in the DLC. The radio stations feel kind of underwhelming without DJs.\n\nFinally all the fun of collecting and customizing various interesting cars, and finding ways to climb or fall to interesting places with a stolen plane/parachute are gutted with the inclusion of super powers. Also, the super powers make gunplay, leveling any of your other stuff, and pretty much every mechanic carried over from Saints Row: the Third obsolete.\n\nIf you get this game, do yourself a favor and make sure you get all the DLC where most of the real fun is. Is it as good as the previous Saints Row? I don't think so, but I still recommend getting it and playing through it. It is a lot of fun, and I love the 50's break out scenario at the beginning.\n\nStacey's thoughts:\nStill awaiting DLC with Jane Austin and the D*ldo Bat. Can somebody make this, for, uhh, scientific purposes.\n- You can return to character customization whenever you want. Game of the year.\n- Katana ZERO? More like, Katana ZERO CONCLUSION.\n\nI had too high expectation on this game, I thought it was going to be Hotline Miami but better.\nIn the end I still prefer Hotline Miami, specifically Hotline Miami 2.\n\nOne thing I dislike is the lack of combo scoring system. \nIt's a good way to make the players act fast and execute their actions flawlessly, instead the game only has a timer bar that never runs out as a way to motivate the player to go fast.\n\nI am aware how \"pointless\" game scores are.\nBut seeing a number going up feels good.\n\nWhat happens when you kill an enemy in Hotline Miami?\n - You get to see a number pops out, and the score goes up indicating that you are doing good!\n - Satisfying bloody hit sound.\n - Throbbing light on the edge of the map.\n - Randomized dead sprite of the enemy, sometimes they get dismembered depending on the weapon.\n\nIn Katana ZERO you'd get :\n - A \"fwoob\" sound.\n - A same dying animation of the enemy getting knocked and bleed to death. Instead of getting decapitated or something.\n - Flashy slash effect.\n\nAt one point I wondered on why should I even bother killing the enemies when it didn't reward me with anything in the room with a minecart. \nWhen having the enemy being killed by the minecart or the player makes no difference.\n\n[spoiler]More like Katana ZERO REWARD. I think this is it, exactly why I am disappointed by it. Imagine playing soulsbornekiro or Hollow Knight without earning any kind of currency??? Killing the enemies would feel pointless.[/spoiler]\n\nIt's basically way more fun and rewarding to kill an enemy in Hotline Miami than Katana ZERO.\n\nThen there are other stuff like...\nUnfun stealth gameplay. \nRollspamming without consequence.\nBeing able to endlessly doing a mid air attack without having to touch the ground first.\n\nThere are also waaaay too many checkpoints in my opinion, it encouraged me to just brute force everything with roll spamming without having to worry about starting over.\nThe rooms could've been a bit bigger and longer. But also less room, quality over quantity.\n\nAnd finally, the story.\nI was intrigued by it but it just ended abruptly with a \"To be continued\".\nIt's like they only wrote 50% of it then slapped a \"To be continued\" and called it a day.\nThe game seems to rely heavily on \"mentioning stuff off screen that player will never get to see\" to tease the player.\nI already knew that the game is going to be short, but I didn't expect it to be this disappointing. \n\nIt's not a bad game, I just had the wrong expectation.\n\nI might change it to positive if I was satisfied by the DLC.\nOr maybe after beating the hard mode, I heard it's more fun.\n- The latest S tier Deckbuilder Roguelike, joining the ranks of Slay the Spire and Monster Train for me. I think that's all that really needs to be said.\n\nIt leans heavily into kiss/curse type effects, if you like the ability to manipulate rng and do some busted stuff with your sequencing you will love it. It is more of a thinker on a turn to turn basis than other games of this genre, but if that isn't a turn off then it's a really solid game with some unique characters/mechanics that feel fresh.\n- Ok to make it short.\n\n- Poor graphics (like 10 years old PC game)\nBUT nothing more to complain about.\n\n- great atmosphere, great story, very good fighting mechanics. Of course great price.\n\nIf you have nothing against japan style - just play the game. One of funniest games in some years for me.\n- Ratchet & Clank is always fun. The older games are clearly better, as it feels like the more modern they get, the shallower and simpler they become. They now feel almost like a demo of a game - you just get to dip your toe into each of the systems, never really fully engaging with any of them. New abilities are just thrown at you with no fanfare, and then you only need them 3 times, and it never asks you to combine them in new ways. Everything feels underwhelming and tossed aside shortly after being introduced. That's almost the theme of the game - they even have Ratchet meeting a fellow Lombax for the first time ever, the thing he has been focused on since game 1, and it's pretty much just \"hi, let's go do the next thing.\" The series has been casualized, just as neutered as their formerly innuendo-laden titles. \n\nBut it's still fun to play, it's just lacking the magic it used to have.\n- very complicated game and the tutorial is good at explaining the high level concepts but you will struggle with basic things like 'how do i get more gold'. \n\nfurther it may take a while to get into the game. for example i found it very hard - but i realised it was trying to do too much in a single lifetime and instead needed to focus on the long game while roleplaying each character. In that regard crusader kings 3 is different to other stratagy games like total war or stellaris - which encourage you to snowball the map. At the moment it doesn't seem that straightforward.\n\nthere are a few AI quirks in particular with combat - i've seen enemies embark/dissembark troops for years which should be costing them gold each time they embark.\n- Do yourself a favor.  Go in as blind as possible.  Don't look at any guides.  The system of getting pages of the manual that you can't fully understand is a stroke of genius.\n\nAlso I haven't found a waterfall that *doesn't* have a secret behind it.\n\n**EDIT: Finished the game**\n\nI'll admit for many of the later \"post-game puzzles\" I looked at a guide for.  The in game language is very difficult to decipher blindly, and if you're not familiar with English you probably shouldn't even bother.  \n\nThe surprising thing about this game is you can pretty much do any puzzle at any given time once you get one or two specific items, but because of how the manual is handled, you'll never know how until you see the pages (or experiment a lot)\n\nI think the most amount of tries I've spent on a boss fight was 7-8, but nothing is stopping you from exploring more and finding stat boosts.\n- What can I say that hasn't been said and that you don't know.\nThis game is IN-SANE.\nThe attention to detail is mind-boggling, the missions, from the smallest to all the main missions are worthy of oscars.\nThe single player campaign is one of the best adventures I ever went on in my life. This is why I love games.\nThe beauty of this game in indescribable. It's one of most realistic living worlds I've ever been in.\nIn fact, it felt so real to me, that I would spend hours living and breathing the game, I felt I was there, at that time.\nTaking care of my horse, spending time fishing and hunting, sometimes for hours.\nRiding my horse in strong winds, and heavy rain, collecting every piece of clothing and trying to look dashing at all times.\nI got attached to people, took care of them, or dragged them behind my horse when I wasn't in the mood for their BS.\nI've been there. I lived there. That was me, I was a cowboy. Nobody will convince me otherwise.\n- Ok, so... one of my favourite films of my childhood. HOWEVER; not being able to start in SANDBOX mode from the start almost INSTANTLY put me off this title, I mean, really? So you have to complete the in-game island tasks/missions (***)*)*)*)*). And after only 4 hours of play through.... \n\nSPOILER ALERT: Dinosaurs escape their enclosures!! ALL THE TIME, its frankly trying to emulate the movie (Jurassic Park 1) as where the DIno's always escape and again SPOILER ALERT: THE INTROS TO EVERY PART OF THE GAME BASICALLY TELL YOU THIS IS DEFO GOING TO HAPPEN.\n\nTo conclude:\n\n1) There is a heavy lean on the movies (I personally don't think that's bad)\n2) It offers a SANDBOX within the opening screen however then informs this is blocked (WHICH IS ANNOYING) until certain missions have been completed.\n3)  DINOSAURS ESCAPE CONSTANTLY\n4) DINOSAURS ESCAPE CONSTANTLY\n5) The game is more interested in visuals rather than content\n- The best game ever made by Valve. Great story, beautiful dialogues with funny jokes, interesting puzzles, perfect atmosphere and a lot of fun in co-op with friends. You made a great work, Valve, and thank You for this absolute masterpiece.\n10/10.\n- Playing this game instantly brought back memories of me playing TMNT, Battletoads, Double Dragon, and Streets of Rage, with my little brother on the NES and Sega Genesis in the early 90s. Luckily this game doesn’t feature TMNT’s ridiculous water level or Battletoads' sadistic peed bike level. The graphics are perfect, the controls are great, the soundtrack is awesome (especially the Wu-Tang stage, and the Shredder stage), and the levels and overworld map are fun to navigate. I’ve played through the story mode with all 7 characters and have played through the arcade mode multiple times solo and many times in multiplayer and I’ve enjoyed every bit of it. This game is so much fun.\n\nThere are a few things I wish existed though. I wish there were more playable characters. I wish that you did not lose your 7 character’s progress in story mode when you start a new game. I wish you could see the difficulty level of the online arcade game you are joining. I wish there were cumulative stats you could see for arcade and story mode that showed the number of times you completed a stage, how many enemies you knocked out, objects you’ve destroyed, stage times, combo streaks, times taunted, etc. I wish you could create your own turtle and assigned moves, specials, jumps, taunts, and colors.\n- Her story starts you off in an old looking computer with what looks like Windows 95, or perhaps a previous version. Once there you are presented with a database of footage from a 1990s, where you must piece together what happened.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\nWithout spoiling anything, since this game is all story based, you are revisiting video clips of seven separate interviews trying to piece together what exactly happened. When you start off, you are placed in front the pc with the word “murder” already typed in. With this simple word, you are given, you must, delve deeper into the story, and form your own conclusion as to what happened, but the more you go deeper into the mystery, the more confused you may become; perhaps even discarding your previous assumption many times before coming to a conclusion that does not go against her story.    \n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nThis game is not a conventional game in terms of gameplay. Instead, you are watching videos and finding potential terms that could lead you to more videos which will reveal more as to her past and what, and who was involved in this incident. Some might not like this, so if the idea of an exclusively story based game does not appeal, do not bother. It is an interesting concept, and very captivating if you play it without any distractions, perhaps more interesting if you play it with a friend and try to piece the mystery together (much like I did).\n\n[h1]Verdict: 8.5/10[/h1]\n\nIf you enjoyed this review, or found it helpful, please feel free to follow our curator [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/WeLoveKawaiiNekos#curation]here.[/url]\n- I'll lay it out. If you're really interested in the hacking mechanic, that might be sufficient reason to play this game. Otherwise, I'd be inclined to give it a miss.\n\nFrom a gameplay perspective, there's not really much to hook a new player. There's a long period at the start where you're expected to randomly interact with people, but given no reason why you should do so. The whole socializing and partying thing isn't intuitive unless you're a person who'd normally be into that, and there's little in the game that pushes you in that direction. As a result, progressing as far as the story actually starting is often the result of accident at best. It took me 4 hours of just wandering around, not knowing what I was supposed to be doing or why.\n\nOnce you're able to program there's a bit more direction and less frustration, but you're still not given much reason for doing it until later on.\n\nAll in all, stick around if you're really invested in getting to the programming. Otherwise, it's an exercise in frustration and shallow conversations that's not really a lot of fun.\n\nArt's gorgeous though, so the game has that going for it at least.\n- So, I only found this game because my favorite Vtuber Miilkywayz on Twitch played it. It seemed pretty interesting but when she started making her own cards. As an IRL witch I was WAY more interested. The game itself is great, I love making cards and learning their meanings and seeing how how the story changes changes based on your deck and the cards drawn. And the replaybility of it is amazing given its price. 10/10 from me. Need more games like this.\n- Uncharted 4: A Thief's End:\n\nThe ambitious end to a long running franchise, Uncharted 4: A Thief's End is a very fascinating game.\nThe gunplay is enjoyable, the puzzles are decent and the humor is pretty good, there are some hilarious character interactions.\n\nThe story though, isn't very deep but I liked the darker approach and the flashbacks, it's interesting enough to keep you playing, and it really makes you care for the characters.\n\nExploration works decently, but it could've been better, there are documents you can read or find collectibles. The open area in Madagascar was one of the best parts of the game in my opinion, the car handles very well and the driving feels phenomenal.\n\nLastly, climbing is a very big part of the game, and even though the climbing mechanics are very smooth, I really had to force myself to enjoy it some times, and I wish there was less of it.\n\nThe action sequences are easily the best thing about this game, some jaw-dropping set-pieces keep you on the edge of your seat.\n\nUncharted 4 is the definition of a \"Movie Videogame\".\nIt's absolutely gorgeous, the cinematography is outstanding, the performances are fantastic and the soundtrack fits well, but gameplay-wise it's just... exhausting, not because of the controls or the gunplay, but because of the hand-holding and the linearity.\n\nUncharted the Lost Legacy:\n\nUncharted the Lost Legacy is proof that Uncharted can great even without Nathan Drake. The Lost Legacy is essentially just more Uncharted 4, it's something like a stand-alone expansion, and a good one at that.\n\nHonestly, I am surprised, I enjoyed this more than I expected. Even though the gameplay is more of the same, there's less climbing, and the fact that the game is relatively short is mostly a positive.\n\nThe game rarely feels repetitive, every puzzle is different from each other, and there is also an open area in the middle of the game where you can explore, which was implemented very well.\n\nAs for Chloe and Nadine, they make a pretty nice duo, where's Chloe is likeable and a goofball, Nadine is the opposite, she's aggressive and focuses on her mission. I liked their chemistry and I think both characters work very well together.\n\nAnd now for the negatives, the story isn't necessarily bad, it's just very generic and there are no stakes. Also, in my personal opinion, the biggest flaw the game has is that there are barely any highlights in it, almost no action except from the last chapter, which is a complete letdown considering how the action is literally the best part about this series.\n\nOverall it's very solid, and for its size it's definitely worth checking out, a great stand-alone expansion.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThank you Sony! Both games runs surprisingly well and overall very fun games. Uncharted 2 is still my favorite tho, but i'm happy to see Uncharted 4 and the Lost Legacy finally on PC, Uncharted 1,2,3 when?\n- This does what I wish AAA RPGs with narratives would do; choices actually feel like they make an impact and the gameplay changes that reflect this are dynamic in nature and provide meaningful differences in the conversations.\n\nIt doesn't feel this way on a macro scale, the meaning is more in the individual encounters with some exceptions. To word it a little differently, I felt like my choices had very little impact on the story as a whole and I could easily (a little too easily) steer the final outcome at any time but, within individual interrogations, what I chose to do had a major affect on the immediate narrative.\n\nThat being said, it is a wonderful game to play for four to six hours on a Sunday and at $15 USD it is cheap and entertaining enough to only need a single playthrough to feel like you've gotten your money's worth. Although I haven't started my second playthrough, I'm already thinking about when I want to sit down and have another go.\n- getting better in controls, HUD, and resources management balances, unlike Rise TR\nslight improvement in graphics, OST is good though\nseveral 'cool' scenes, creativity has taken a great leap <applause>\ncross over with Assassin's Creed (due to same publisher?)\nLara is getting more and more 'demonic', no hard feelings, its just subliminary messages to the youth by major games coorporation\nI can't believe i can play as Lara Kid instead of Lara Croft :D '+1'\nstoryline is getting ridiculous, come back to earth bruh LOL its good fun\n\ngood luck on your future endeavour devs :)\n- Hello Charlotte is not a game; it is a confessional.\nIf you're here you've probably already realized, but I wish to place massive emphasis that Hello Charlotte, and Hello Charlotte 3 especially, has very little gameplay, and what is present is very standard RPGMaker fare. If you are the kind to balk at visual novels, HC3 will not be your cup of tea. Watch a playthrough or something if you're interested, but don't expect any kind of engaging play.\nWith that said: Hello Charlotte 3 (and its DLC, Heaven's Gate) has been one of the most emotional, impactful pieces of art I've ever engaged with. It is horrifically honest, incorrigibly vulnerable, and, as previously stated-- more a confessional than a game. With everything I know how to say and with everything I have to say about it, I cannot find a way to truly articulate what Hello Charlotte made me feel (still makes me feel) and how it has affected me.\n\nHello Charlotte: Childhood's End is from the perspective not of the Charlotte of the previous two games, but a new, blank slate PC. While not necessary to play the previous two games, I strongly recommend it. It develops on the themes of the previous two games, and in doing so, completely recontextualizes them. C and Anri of HC2 return, as does Scarlett, though not in the forms we are accustomed to. We are finally given a full understanding on the nature of Charlotte and the False Realm, and what we are in relation to it.\netherane's art has markedly improved since the second game, with impressive sprite and background artwork, though their style is still recognizable. The music (some composed by etherane, others outsourced) is varied and distinctive. Most prominent about etherane's work, however, are the themes and writing, which have matured considerably since the release of HC2. Though often garish and on the nose, HC3 is a poignant commentary on the nature of art and fiction, the impact we have on one another, and our understanding of realness itself.\nYou will experience confusion. You will experience whiplash. The game intends to make you unsure and uncomfortable in its consumption, <i>deliberately</i> so. In the process it becomes a jarring, distinctive work of art unique to its creator and an important representation of the Millenial psyche. It's a psychological horror game and by God will it force you to experience psychological horror.\n- Oh boy. DoDonPachi Resurrection.\nI love this game. Its loads of modes, tight controls, great bullet patterns, and fun gameplay and scoring mechanics make it an awesome shooter. \nThat being said, this game is tough as nails. Even the novice mode is hard as heck and definitely isn't novice-friendly. I reccomend having one or two shmup clears under your belt before you try to tackle DoDonPachi. (Crimzon Clover's novice mode is a good introduction to shmupping) You need some skill to get the maximum amount of enjoyment out of this game.\n\nStill, though, It's awesome! DoDonPachi Resurrection is a very fun experience, even with it's difficulty.\n\n- I have been a big fan of the Halo series since CE so I may be a bit biased but yea.\n\nPositives\n- Good campaign\n- Fun coop\n- Good story\n- Good mechanics\n- Graphics are good\n- Good price, honestly don't wouldn't even wait for it to go on sale\n\nCons\n- I have noticed a sound delay every now and again\n- A few graphical glitches every now and again, not really regular\n- The fact they exchanged the original Halo Reach XP and levelling system with \"seasons\" \n     - Can no longer just buy what you want, you need to play 4 million mp matches just to \n       unlock the helmet you want then repeat that for the matching chest piece in the next \n       season\n     - Can no longer get experience from the campaign (Edit: This has since been updated so \n       you can ear medals from campaign but you still can't directly earn xp) \n     - The maximum experience able to be collected is to low for the later levels. I think the max \n        should be lifted fro everyone, or slowly go up depending on what level you are\n- How long it takes to level up is just stupid. It was good for the first few levels then it feels like there is a massive jump in time.\n- A few audio glitches here and then. (For me anyway you need to be facing the sound to hear it, even if its over comms\n\nI love the game and would honestly recommend it but think a few things could be changed in my personal opinion.\n- With almost 300 hours of Destiny 2 (D2) back on Battle.net (the Blizzard launcher), let me give this perspective/advice for new players, specifically with regards for the F2P offering that is Destiny 2: New Light, with a few more holistic thoughts sprinkled throughout:\n\nThis overall game is very good. It doesn't always live up to its promise (the first mission of every campaign is always the most polished thing aside from the raids/dungeons), but when it does, it [b]really[/b] shines.\n\nThe gunplay is unrivaled. The visual/audio feedback is great, the handling feels really good, and enemies really pop when you take them out. Expect nothing less from the studio that brought us grunt birthday parties.\n\nThe game is better in a fireteam. Now that the base game is F2P [though with considerably less content than it used to be/I would like], this should be easier than ever for most activities. That said, a huge majority of my playtime was done solo. It can get tricky at times (\"Darkness Zones\" in certain missions prevent respawning but allow for revives, so solo players have a distinct disadvantage there). \n\nWith that said, dungeons (currently 'The Shattered Throne', 'Pit of Heresy', 'Prophecy' which is free to all players, 'Grasp of Avarice', 'Duality', and 'Spire of the Watcher') and raids (\"Last Wish\" from Forsaken, \"Garden of Salvation\" from Shadowkeep, \"The Deep Stone Crypt\" from Beyond Light, 'Vow of the Disciple' from Witch Queen, as well as 'Vault of Glass' and 'King's Fall' from D1 - both of which are both free to all players) are best experienced with a team, so don't shy away from LFG group-finder options like the Discord, official app, or any number of other sites (just make sure to accurately describe your experience, level, and gear. 'Tis only polite). \n\nOf the matchmade multiplayer offerings, I enjoy Gambit (PvPvE, reminds me of the Black Ops Zombies 4z4 mode done right), jump into the occasional Strike (PvE, matchmade fireteams running campaign-like missions), and have no interest in Crucible (PvP, it's fine I guess, but I've never liked PvP that's dependent in large part on personal progression - especially in the competitive modes like Trials of Osiris and Iron Banner)\n\nDon't be afraid to ignore content - this is absolutely the kind of game where you can set your own goals. Want a specific exotic gun? Look up where it drops and focus on grinding that content. Want a specific roll on a random roll gun? Find the best possible farming (or crafting) method and go to town. Chase down some of the exotic questions that the game clutters up your quest page with, or just goof around doing things that you find fun while absolutely ignoring all signposts.\n\nSome stuff just won't be explained in game. It's not as bad as Warframe (much less need for a wiki) but some things are still obscured. Feel free to look up Xur (exotic weapon vendor who visits on weekends) and other hidden exotics tied to specific activities, lost sectors, patrol locations, or quest chains.\n\nFor anything that you can't easily find online - reach out and find a sherpa. The community for this game tends to be pretty great, and enough of us have spent enough time leaning specific parts of it (e.g. raids) or just mechanics in general (\"What are random rolls? Which do I keep?\") that we'd be happy to jump onto discord (there are a bunch for PC, just check out the subreddit sidebar linked below) and answer any and all questions you may have. \n\nThe fact that a representative chunk of this game is free makes this the perfect time to dip your toes in without emptying out your wallet. Any other questions about this game as a product (\"Should I pay for DLC? Is Eververse worth it?\") should absolutely be researched elsewhere.\n\nIf you're looking for a place to start with the F2P content, finish the intro missions in the Cosmodrome. New and returning players are semi-regularly upgraded to a new light level floor, but means that you can miss out on the \"learning the ropes\" parts of the game that come with working your way through the New Light quest chain or unlocking different subclasses. [As of Beyond Light, all of the campaign content through Forsaken are not currently accessible. Release order was Red War (launch campaign) > Forsaken > Shadowkeep > Beyond Light > Witch Queen, followed by the upcoming expansions Lightfall > Final Shape.]\n\nEyes up, guardian.\n\nFootnotes for people yelling at me in the comments:\n-All of this is my opinion. Feel free to hold your own and disagree with mine.\n-I generally enjoy grinding, looter shooters, FPS's, and weird sci-fi space magic. Halo, Borderlands, Warframe, and CoD Zombies are some of my most-played and favorite games.\n-As far as I can tell, anything that is not strictly subjective in the above is factually correct [as of Season of Plunder, with updates noted throughout. This game changes quite a bit over time, so make sure to do your own research before spending money on it]. If I've missed something, feel free to point it out in the comments and I'll do my best to update this periodically. \n-This review previously made mention of both content vaulting and weapon sunsetting. These practices have both been discontinued as of Season of Plunder. However, it is not clear at this if or when power capped or vaulted may return/be uncapped, if ever.\n\n-----------------\nTL:DR: It's good. Not perfect, but really good. And since it's free, you can get a really good sense of if this game is for you without paying for any of it. You can play almost any activity solo pretty easily except for a handful of endgame activities. If you're overwhelmed at first, just play through the Cosmodrome missions while you get your feet under you, or ask a veteran player for help.\n-----------------\n\nSites to use (List was compiled at Shadowkeep launch, but most of it should still be relevant/useful)\n\n    \nBeginner's Guide (Current as of Beyond Light) - https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/49007\n\nThe DTG Subreddit - /r/DestinyTheGame on Reddit - https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/\n\nDestiny Item Manager (mange your inventory from your browser even while in-game, essential to avoid unneeded trips back to the tower) - app.destinyitemmanager.com\n\nDestiny 2 Checklist (Lists out everything to do as well as when it resets in-game) - www.d2checklist.com/\n\nLight gg (Database of in-game items, useful for looking up random rolls) - https://www.light.gg/\n\nBraytech org (Lots of overlapping features, but I really like their maps) - braytech.org/\n\nDatto (Destiny Youtuber / 24:02 Raider who posts lots of useful/educational content, including exotic guides) - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkmAjbIecTIjTQctolYeuDw\n\nIf you've played D2 on another system, check out the CrossSave page (https://www.bungie.net/7/en/crosssave) on the Bungie net official site respectively to get all of your content and progression moved over to Steam.\n\nStory Recap up through Shadowkeep (Spoilers Destiny 1 / D1, and D2, obviously) (My name is Byf on YouTube: The Complete Story of Destiny!

This is definitely one of the best narrative driven RPG maker games ever made - it has everything you could want.  It has beautiful art, beautiful music, wonderful narration, it's atmospheric, great characters, meaningful choices, a story of overcoming hardships similar to a real life instead of just a story, and the ending I got was beautiful! I have only played the game once but the game has a lot of different branching paths with choices really making a large difference in the game.  This game will always have a special place in my heart.\n- This is such a faithful recreation of Star Ocean 2, I don't think I'll ever even consider playing the PS1 original, or the PSP remake. The beauty of the new HD landscapes and animations, added to the wonderful musical score, the various combat improvements and the classic story, this is one you won't soon forget.\n\n20 hours to beat\n2 main characters to see the story from different perspectives\n13 recruitable party members\na MASSIVE world to explore\nintense crafting system\nStorytelling as only the japanese could tell in the 90's\n\n100% recommend.\n- I even set a calendar reminder so that I could get this on release. I wish I hadn't bothered. Going great guns until I got to the passage. Game over as I can't progress. Tried allsorts to drop the jammer but unable to do so. I guess it is a case of waiting for all the bugs to get resolved.\n- I got this game for $12 off humble bundle. Me and my friends play it for hours on end. This game honestly feels like the perfect fighting game for me because there is no set style. I don't have to remember specific combos or any crazy inputs. It's just simplicity. Unless you want to do that in which you can. But it's fun for anyone. If I were you I would get it off of humble bundle for $12.\n- It looked old when it was released. Now it's downright ugly. The gunplay is clunky. The physics are terrible. The bugs are ever present.\n\nThe RPG mechanics are top notch. The choices you make matter.\n\nOne of the greatest games ever made.\n- They need to add more weapons like a galil or m249 or something and maybe more vehicles and playmodes.But overall so many possibilities\n- Game slaps, played the first area, unlocked ranked and spent 4 hours grinding a 2 minuet long level to reach the top rank in bronze 1 division and i'm going to do it again tomorrow\n- I read the negative reviews and backlash against DoubleFine, but I thought that I would be OK even if the game had some bugs and wasn't quite finished, so I picked it up anyway. That was a mistake.\n\nThe game is not just unfinished, its in an Alpha state. Which is sad, because I definetly would enjoy the game if it was done. As it is, the game is entertaining for a couple hours, then quickly grows tiresome and frustrating. The bugs are not crippling, but taken as a whole they represent a game that is very unbalanced and grates on you over time. \n\nIf DF-9 ever hits the $5 pile, pick it up. otherwise pass.\n- Only originally bought this to support the artist, since I'm a huge fan of his pixel art work. It's amazing, and there's a tonne of eye candy to fill your eyeballs with. However, I can't recommend this to everyone as after the first few hours it's become a bit of a chore.\n\n- The game is a \"clicker\" type with rpg/upgrade elements. It's too slow to play in the background/absent mindedly but not fast enough to keep your attention fully.\n- Each round/attempt at a boss takes way too goddamn long. \n- Barely any interaction with the world. You build tower defense style, and equip new items, but beyond that you don't have any special abilities, no \"oh shit\" once per loop power, no ability to target specific enemies, nothing. Just watch everything play out and hope your little guy doesn't get pulped.\n- Crafting/Supplying is sort of hidden away and if you don't know about dismantling you'll never grind out all the items you need to build new stuff.\n- Lore/Journal entries are hidden away and require resources to unlock using a little button on the bottom of the screen that's easy to miss. I only found it 20 hours in. The writing is cringey and obviously done by someone who probably enjoys Adam Sandler films.\n- The card system is a neat idea, but jesus christ there's too much garbage shuffling. Imagine playing MtG with a deck of 100 cards and 90 of them are lands, and everytime you get a new hand you reshuffle the whole deck so all you get is more lands. Oblivion (destroys a tile) rarely, if ever, pops up. \n- Character skills are kinda bad? You might get a good one every level (which again, takes forever) but half the time it'll be useless \"leave 10% of food/resources at camp\" when you're not doing a resource grind run.\n- So much trash equipment you have to sort through and breaks game flow.\n\nAnd the biggest \"don't recommend\" from me would be the issue with how combining tiles works. If you put two tiles beside each other they sometimes change the tiles to something else. Example - put a Vampire Mansion beside a Village and you get a town full of ghouls that after 3 loops around the map turns into an upgraded town. But you still get trash equipment from the quests it gives, and putting a Vampire Mansion beside any other type of town doesn't change that town at all. So there's no reason to experiment, and it really limits the gameplay. You'd think they'd focus on that aspect gameplay wise, especially with experimentation to get the most bonuses out of all your tiles... but no. There's a small list of things that interact with each other, and that's it.\n\nI still highly recommend it since the game is cheap, the art is amazing and the artist/indie devs should get support. But I think it's a good 2-3 major updates, expansions or fan modding away from getting really, really amazing.\n- The Steam trailer really doesn't do this game justice.\n\nIts extremely early access right now, and the gameplay itself is nothing too spectacular (yet), but the super dynamic proximity chat is what really makes this game for me.\nHearing the muffled screams of someone getting choked out by a bug, followed shortly after by the panicked wails of another crewmember running for the life, is likely one of the funniest things I have ever experienced in a video game.\nIt truly is such a simple, yet infinitely expandable mechanic that I am really exited to see build upon in the future.\n\nPERSONAL IDEA IF THE DEVS READ THIS REVIEW:\nA monster that picks a target to stalk and follow silently. While stalking, the monster records whatever its target says, then, after it has stalked enough and kills it target, it turns from a hunter to an ambush predator. Staying stationary in the dark and playing the recorded sounds of its now dead target in order to lure in their friends.\nImagine hearing your friend, rounding the corner, and realizing that your friend is already long dead...\n- Refunded.\n\nFeels like they released the wrong game files - half the game seems to be broken or missing...\nBasic functions such as zooming in and out, no tutorial, huge amounts of buttons that don't have any impact. Good idea, terrible execution.\n- This is everything a remaster is supposed to be. You remember playing this game over a decade ago, and the graphics weren't \"that bad\". But nostalgia is a cruel mistress. You play the original again, and you can barely stand it.\n\nThe comes the HD version, which was alright, playable. But then, the real remaster, the Definitive Edition, you start playing the game and it FEELS like it used to feel. Like it is supposed to look. It is quite obviously way better than it used to be, but it FEELS the same.\n\nIf you ever liked playing this game, and want to play it again, this won't disappoint you. Especially with the distinct lack of RTS games in the last decade or so, this still holds true as one of the best ones.\n- Playing this game for the first time six years after its initial release proved to be a delight in disguise. With all the memes and jokes established, I was finally able to understand what the fuss was all about back in 2011. Despite not having the best gameplay, story or graphics out there, something about this title just made me want to finish every quest I deemed worth completing. \n\n9/10 - mods recommended\n- it's a shame but i honestly cannot recommend this game if you are a disabled person, i wasn't that far into the game when my character started panicking apon seeing a disabled person [person with leg braces] and then gets a \"no good answer\" bit of dialog and all the options are saying something wrong or saying nothing, trying to go with the least bad option aside from saying nothing since i know as a disabled person myself [i'm a wheelchair user] it can be pretty upsetting getting people just randomly stare at me and at least when they say something slightly wrong they are engaging with me as a person, my character then proceeds to talk abt what an \"inspiration\" it is 2 c a disabled person living their life,,, not exaggerating when i say i let my head hit the desk, closed the game and uninstalled, i understand that this is probably put in the game to be a teachable moment for the able bodied audience but ironically in trying to educate about us disabled people they then made the assumption that no disabled people would be playing their game as there is no option to make your character disabled or even to make them remotely aware of disability and ended up just making the experience awful for the disabled gamers they seem to be trying to help\n- No additional account, no unnecessary launcher, no denuvo, no epic exclusivity, no microtransactions, just a video game as it always should be..\n- Even with over 500 years difference between us, Andreas is one of the most relatable characters I've played this year because I too would rather try to ineffectively solve random mysteries than directly confront my depression.\n- I left home with nothing but a needle and my granny's briefcase full o' snakes, hitched a ride to Boring Springs, killed two men and three snakes, learned to speak Goblin, and befriended a woman whose home was burned to the ground by a gang of cows. Then I bought a horse and left the tutorial area, and things got weird. I'm pretty on board with this one.\n- tl;dr: if you're looking for \"Terraria in space\", buy Starbound. Don't waste 88 hours of your life like I did trying to find the game in this steaming pile of crap.\n\nIt's like Starbound or Terraria! Except without any of the diversity or fun discoveries that make Starbound and Terraria great.\n\nNow including:\n-Terrible devs that clearly abandoned ship years ago\n-Ugly, generic spritework that lacks any of the rough-cut charisma that other pixel art games usually have\n-Weapons that all feel the same\n-Confusing progression\n-Very plain biomes that look the same no matter where you go (The lower biomes aren't any better. They're basically the same thing in a different color.)\n-Indescipherable UI (with no map, by the way.)\n-Stupid glitches abound\n\nThe only credit I can give it is that it's a program that exists and can be run by my computer.\n1/10.\n- When 'Papers, Please' goes online. The game is similar. You make a judgement on the item based on the state regulation and/or some task given to you. The game is really in early stage but foundation of game mechanic is already laid and can be expanded for more challenge. \n\nThe US$5 & under price tag is fair enough for this early game. I already have the gameplay videos uploaded, you guys make a choice to buy or not. I wish I could choose 'neither' recommend this game, the game is not bad or good for me given its current version.\n\nPlaylist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2dyX3SxPgukmvyL31uQNpfXtaeVXNV3R\n\nEDIT1: Decided to change this to \"not recommended\" due to uncertain future development of this game.\n- EDIT:\nRobot Entertainment has decided to dump Gameforge as the EU publisher and publish the game themselves. I would like to applaud their decision. Better late (in this case quite late) than never. However, I will not change this review to recommended for the simple fact that they shouldn't have selected that publisher in the first place. This is what ultimately ruined the EU version of the game, and it should be a good example to any other developers who consider Gameforge as their publisher (although more are more developers are duming Gameforge nowadays). I am not going to edit any of the details below since I haven't played the game after I wrote the original review, but I will most certainly consider returning to the game after the migration of the servers is complete.\n\nHere's the original review:\nPart 1:\nHow To Kill A Potentially Good Game (For Dummies):\n- Make a potentially good game.\n- Give the publishing rights to Gameforge.\n- Done!\n\nI mean, let's take a look at some of the games that Gameforge ruined:\n- Aion EU (utterly dead)\n- Tera EU (completely dead)\n- Soldier Front 2 EU (a.k.a. \"S.K.I.L.L., although the only skill you need for that game is a wallet)\n- Raiderz EU (shut down)\n- Mythos (shut down)\n- Katsuro: Path of Honor (shut down)\n- Hellbreed (shut down)\n... the list goes on ...\n\nWhy would ANYONE in their right mind allow Gameforge to publish their game?! Gameforge is known as the WORST European publisher. No one does business with them anymore and they're close to filing for bankruptcy. They already closed their location in Berlin. Why would you do that, Robot Entertainment?\n\nIt could have been a great game...\n\nPart 2:\nSince some lovely folks commented that they would REALLY (real-time executive realness) want me to review the game itself, and not its publisher, here you go:\n\nPros:\n- Great voice acting. The way they went with it (overly sarcastic) could have ended up being cringy, like the one in Wildstar, but instead, they did a good job with it.\n- Good animations. The game feels like it's polished and well executed.\n- Short queues and loading screens.\n- Interesting tower defence gameplay (as far as the Survival mode goes).\n- Character development and a crafting system.\n- Runs great on a high-end laptop.\n\nCons:\n- Poorly optimized for computers that are supposed to be able to run the game on its minimal settings.\n- Gets quite repetitive quite fast.\n- Grinding for materials can be tedious.\n- The Siege mode needs a lot of work. It is nowhere near as polished as the Survival mode.\n- The Survival mode can be too short at the early levels.\n- The developer decided to give the game to the worst publisher in Europe, and probably even the world. I mean, even EA isn't that bad anymore. I guess Gameforge could compete against Webzen for the first place.\n- You are able to buy almost everything with real cash, and if you don't want to, you better prepare for a long grind.\n- Did I mention how stupid the decision to give the publishing rights to Gameforge was? I think I did, but oh well...\n- The game is basically a cash shop oriented version of OMD! 2.\n\nThere you go! You're welcome.\n\nP.S.: Needless to say, I won't be spending a dime on this game, as long as Failforge gets a cut. I encourage everyone to do the same. Robot Entertainment might get their heads out of their... (you got the point) and change the publisher before it's too late for the game.\n- Started strong, ended annoyingly.\n\nMoral of the story? People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.\n\nIt paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that \"routine\" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.\n\nI liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters. But it all fell apart and tries to teach a very vapid moral that someone in their early 20's who has never had a meaningful relationship would idealize.\n\nAt least it was short.\n\n- I was excited to play this after playing Persona 5 and Persona 5 Royal (my introductions to the series) to death.  This game was raved about and I thought, if it's more of the same then this should be great...\n\nThe major problem I have with this game is that it's so painfully obvious that it's a game made 13 years ago.  It's not a bad game, the look and feel of the Persona series is there and the characters are interesting etc.  But at the same time whenever I played this game, I just wanted to go back and play P5R instead.  Everything is just better in P5R.  The dungeons for example, the difference is night and day.  P5R's dungeons have so much more life to them, and look so much better.  Most of the environments in this game look like dull coloured LEGO sets put together.  It looks like it was originally on a handheld console (despite the remaster).  The other major example is the voice acting.  My god, some of the voice acting in 4G is on par with some of the worst Square Enix efforts.  Audio balancing is terrible as well.  And then there's the subjective stuff.  I personally much prefer P5R's soundtrack over this one, aside from maybe a couple of songs that were cool.  The setting of Tokyo is much more interesting and dynamic than this hokey town in the middle of nowhere.  The characters themselves I found much more engaging in 5R.  This was particularly helped by the quality of voice acting.  I think \n\nI'm glad that people are able to experience this game again on a more available platform.  I think potentially if I had played this back when it was released, I would probably have a different opinion of this game.  If you like Persona games and can look beyond what's dated badly, then the core game is very much the same.  If you were a fan already, this is a quality refresh to the game.  However, if you're like me and experienced the future of this series before playing this, I dont recommend it.  P5R provides the same gameplay but adds so much more.  It's a shame we cannot get that game on Steam instead.\n- owned the original from all the way back in 2014\nloved it tons, even more than RoR2\nsaw RoRR get teased on twitter, was there for its release, thought to myself,\n\"i don't need this, i can just play the ror from 2013, i don't know how to feel about this new one, is it really just the same game again?\"\n\nand then i saw someone grab an item i've never seen before, while playing as a character i've never seen before, on a map layout i've never seen before, using alternate abilities to what was baseline for that character to fight an enemy i've never seen before, and then activate a shrine of the mountain from ror2, and then while doing the teleporter fight they activated a bunch of new machines that turned drones into items and activated a specific equipment for a fee... and then i saw that you can just opt out of whatever you don't like about any of that, at any time!\n\nwhat's not to love about that??\n- I'm not a fan of visual novels.  I hate pixel graphics.  I played all games by these guys and wept like a baby every single time.  More than every single time.  This time, even more than more.  What a masterpiece\n- It's good if you don't mind clicking a lot and getting horse droppings for chest rewards after matches. Literal garbage rewards mostly. Beautiful game though, lots of violence, love the ranged combat.\n- Firstly, neutral reviews should be a thing. Because although the game's story is pretty solid (and some elements of it still very relavant even today), the game suffers from a multitude of issues, so no, I don't truly recommend this game because of those factors. Rockstar themselves should be fixing the broken state of the game, instead of leaving it to people to fix it.\n\nThe problem with this game is that you need to be online to be even able to play it. You NEED to be online to PLAY a SINGLEPLAYER game FROM 2009. I don't know what Rockstar was thinking when they force you to play online, but this is just not okay. There is no online functionality for the game besides maybe cloud saves - something steam cloud could've done just as fine instead of leaving it to their own messy launcher.\n\nBut that's not the only problem with this game. Being that it's an old game, it does not run well on modern systems, not anymore. It suffers from various performance issues. Thankfully, you can use DXVK to get around this problem - but as i said earlier, you shouldnt HAVE TO do this. Rockstar could have easily patched the game to fix the performance issues (that still happen with DXVK mind you - but compared to without DXVK it is MUCH better), instead they focused on patching who knows what.\n\nExcept after you use DXVK, you HAVE to edit a game file to let the game use more than 2 gb of ram. Again, SOMETHING Rockstar could've easily done by updating the game's code to meet the modern standards. Nobody has specs like the one in the minimum recommend anymore. After you do that, you HAVE to edit the amount of vram the game detects by using a command line to fix it. That's already 3 things you have to deal with JUST to be even able to play the game normally.\n\nSome people may see this as a small botherance - some people may see it as a huge inconvenience, but the apparent problem with this is that, once again, you SHOULDNT HAVE TO do all of this. Going past those issues and playing the game, you also have to ensure you limit the fps to 60, either using DXVK or the in game vsync (former being more recommendable as it doesn't hog as much as cpu power). If you decided to bother with all of those steps to make the game playable, congratulations. Now be severely annoyed like I did  because Rockstar has not, for all this time, patched the final mission with the helicopter QTE. One suggested fix for it was to limit the FPS to 60 - which did NOT help me. Other was to install a script file to fix it, which ALSO failed at first, till I tried again like 5-6 times. You as a player should not have to install this stuff and edit games just to fix the game, when the publisher themselves should be doing it. I expect a game to be supported if it's still being sold on Steam. And don't think they don't care about the games being on Steam - they clearly cared when they removed the classic gta trilogy from Steam (which were also left in even more of a broken state compared to how they first came out - but that is an entirely different point).\n\nPutting all of those factors aside, the game itself is very solid, story wise. I really loved all of the symbolism that was apparent throught the game, and concepts such as \"American Dream\" or \"Land of Oppurtunity\" being presented as something that was clearly flawed - which is precisely why people like Nico go down the path of killing people or doing drugs just to survive. You can't go from rags to riches in a \"strong eat the weak\" country - you either do whatever it is you have to do - like Nico - to survive, or you let yourself and your close ones get killed. There are other things the game criticizes as well, like that one conversation where Nico criticizes the food in the city for using \"chemicals that your body spends time getting it off your system\", or something along those lines. I don't think I need to mention that this isn't something they added as a joke, because it is very much there. The game's serious and dark tone might be considered bad by people, but it is because of this dark tone and seriousness that we can actually learn some lessons from it and open our eyes to some truths in our lives.\n\nThe gameplay itself isn't really that complicated, except when it comes to driving the vehicles in the game. They are based on a realistic driving system and although it is debatable how much of a good gaming experience it really is when they made it so realistic, since it introduces a huge learning curve and can end up frustrating the player, I actually ended up loving it for what it is, except when it came to driving motorcycles of any form. The game's simplicity in other regards is what makes it pretty good, in my eyes. Though it sometimes doesn't work the way you think it would (like when you are playing with a controller and have to use auto aim), it is nevertheless solid enough that those are only minor inconveniences and not the kind of problem where you'd want to stop playing the game.\n\nThis game definitely deserves more attention and love - but Rockstar really needs to fix this game themselves if they are still keeping it on Steam's store, because the current situation of the game is not acceptable.\n\n\n- Minesweeper influenced design feels like a fresh take on the Slay-the-Spire-like genre.  Now that I've won with all six classes, and done some of the unlockable difficulty levels, I feel that I've gotten my money's worth with the game, and I have enjoyed the time I've spent so far, but I don't expect great longevity beyond this point.\n\nI do have some minor gripes:\n\n* The pacing on unlocking new classes feels too slow.  It would be nice if the approach was the fairly standard one of unlocking a new class when you win with the previous one, but here there is a currency which is acquired throughout runs, and I found that I usually had to have two winning runs with the previous class to earn enough currency to unlock a new one.\n* Optimal play with some classes requires memorizing tiles which are revealed, and then on later turns these tiles are hidden.  Taking damage because I misremembered what was hidden behind a tile feels unfun and at-odds with what the game otherwise wants to be.\n* I would prefer if the harder difficulty settings were unlocked from the get-go, rather than grinding through easier difficulty settings to find the challenge.\n\nOtherwise, though, it's a fun game with an adorable art style, and not just a clone of the other Spire-likes around.  Recommended if your expectation is to get ten hours or so of strategic puzzling.\n- [h1]Dishonored 2.[/h1]\n[i]If old Samuel could see me now...[/i]\n\n[b][u]Introduction[/u][/b]\nAt its core, Dishonored 2 is little more than a mechanically and narratively contiguous continuation of the Dishonored formula. This isn't a bad thing - the first Dishonored was one of the best stealth-action games of all time - but innovation is too often overlooked in the games industry. DH2 does bring some nuance to the franchise, but new drawbacks are packaged in as well. Put plainly, Dishonored 2 is a game I adore just as much as the original, but there are aspects that certainly left me wishing for better.\n\n[b][u]Plot[/u][/b]\nThe game begins 15 years following Empress Jessamine's assassination, and her daughter, Empress Emily Kaldwin, has ruled the isles since that time. Her father and Lord Protector, Corvo Attano, advises and keeps close watch over her at court. Quickly after Dishonored 2's opening however, the Duke of Serkonos, Luca Abele, comes to Emily's royal tower - bearing a gift. He brings Emily's supposed long lost aunt, Delilah Kaldwin, who then immediately stages a coup in a bid to take the throne. She is successful, and you must escape the city of Dunwall as either Emily or Corvo (more on that later). You then travel to Karnaca, the capital of Serkonos, where you begin a personal crusade to [i]take back what's yours.[/i]\n\n[b][u]Technical Revamp[/u][/b]\nShifting focus for a look at DH2's presentation, the game is gorgeous. There's a hint of the old, comic-book-like aesthetic that was present in the original game, but the graphical fidelity has been greatly improved in this sequel. The textures, lighting, animations, visual effects, and environments are all elegantly rendered. It's easily one of the most beautiful games of 2016. As for the audio; sound effects and voices are realistic, and the OST is as iconic, if not more so than the first game's. Although, when it comes to performance, Dishonored 2 clearly falters. DH2 was a technical mess on launch, and while it runs decently now; some bugs, stutters, and crashes still persist. Overall the presentation is good, but the performance is surely sub-par.\n\n[b][u]Setting & Exploration[/u][/b]\nAs stated earlier, Dishonored 2 is set in Serkonos's city of Karnaca; known as The Jewel of the South. Gone are the dark grays and subdued browns of Dunwall, as Karnaca replaces them with bright, pastel blues and yellows. The metropolis has distinct cultural differences from Dunwall as well, whether it's the widespread use of wind-power over whale oil, or Karnaca's reliance on silver mining to employ its working class. In terms of level design, DH2's stages are much more expansive than anything seen in the first game too. There's lots to explore in every district of Karnaca, especially when verticality and hidden locations are taken into account. There's several routes toward all objectives as well; emphasizing Arkane's \"play your way\" motto. All considered, Dishonored 2's game world is exceedingly well-built.\n\n[b][u]Depth in the Details[/u][/b]\nOne of the most effective ways DH2 differentiates itself from its predecessors is through what I'd call 'structural gimmicks.' To break up the standard pacing, a couple of the game's missions have special set-pieces which can completely turn gameplay convention on its head. An example of this is the 'Clockwork Mansion' on the fourth level. This inventor's home has levers in essentially every chamber that reconfigures a room's layout - such as turning a trophy room into a grand hall. These levers can be used to access new areas or evade enemies, and even reveal traversable spaces behind the walls. It's this degree of imaginative design depth that distinguishes Dishonored 2 from most other games in its genre.\n\n[b][u]Stealth & Combat[/u][/b]\nMoving over to the core gameplay loop, not much has changed from the first game. The stealth and combat are still just as exquisitely implemented as before, with only a couple of refinements. The deviations that come to mind are that drop-assassinations can now be used non-lethally as drop-knockouts, and assassination animations are a much more brutal (but cathartic) spectacle to watch than before. Dishonored 2's central mechanics are near flawless to be sure, but this sequel suffers by adding few new gameplay elements to the mix. Except - well - there is one big feature I've neglected to elaborate on as of yet.\n\n[b][u]Emily [i]or[/i] Corvo[/u][/b]\nIn Dishonored 2, you can play as either Emily Kaldwin, [i]or[/i] Corvo Attano. When Delilah first takes the throne you get a moment to choose one or the other, after which the character you don't pick is turned into a cold, stone statue. Both Emily and Corvo have separate voice actors and personalities, but they share the same goal throughout the game's duration: to save the last of their family, and reclaim the throne for the true Kaldwin heiress. After receiving the mark of The Outsider, Emily and Corvo have different magical abilities too. Where Corvo has blink, Emily has far reach; or where Corvo can stop time, Emily can chain together the lives of her enemies, and kill or incapacitate several people at once. All in all, the decision to allow the player to progress the campaign as either Emily or Corvo was a stroke of brilliance in my estimation.\n\n[b][u]Main Story[/u][/b]\nReturning to the main story - it's another point of criticism for me. There are some magnificent aspects; such as the nostalgic callbacks to events in the first Dishonored or reappearances of some of the original game's best characters, but all considered most of the writing is retreading a beaten path. Just as in Dishonored 1, the game flows from mission to mission where the chief objective is simply to eliminate a key player obstructing your path to the throne. This is perfectly fine from a gameplay perspective, but it can lead to a bit of déjà vu from a narrative outlook. Dishonored 2's writing quality isn't poor, but it doesn't distance itself from the comfortable story-staging of its predecessor, making it feel slightly lazy.\n\n[b][u]A Reactive World[/u][/b]\nOn the other side of the same coin, the narrative reactivity of Dishonored 2's world to your choices is truly admirable. Playing DH2 in high chaos; where you murder many people throughout the game, results in huge environmental storytelling changes compared to low chaos. Here's an example. If you flood the streets of Karnaca red with blood, subsequent levels show you've harmed the city's inhabitants before you even arrive. Citizens’ moods and perceptions will have soured as they become depressed or monstrous in the wake of their crumbling city - causing suicides and murders to spike throughout Karnaca. And corpses bring bloodflies, which further tarnishes The Jewel of the South in a vicious cycle. You can, of course, avoid all this... by showing a whole lot of care in your actions toward others.\n\n[b][u]Conclusion[/u][/b]\nWhen all is said and done, the Dishonored formula is a fantastic one that it's hard to not have fun with. Karnaca is riddled with environmental detail, the stealth mechanics are flawless, combat is devilishly enjoyable, and the game judges you intelligently on your choices. The Dishonored IP is incredibly strong... The tweaks provided are appreciable; I just wish DH2 had made a concerted effort to make it even stronger. But, god-dammit, I enjoyed Dishonored 2 way too much over it's 20+ hour campaign to critique it any longer. Get the game and play it - despite all my pissy complaints, you won't be disappointed.\n\n[h1]Personal Rating: 9/10 - Absolutely Outstanding[/h1]\n- As a cybersecurity professional , I would classify this game as malware, or at the least adware.\nWhy? It opens up a number, at least 10 when I checked, of connections to various points on the internet which have no purpose in running the game. They are only there so the vendor can spam you with advertising, track you, or for other unspecified activities. \nAs such, I can NOT recommend this game. \n\nTo verify, I disconnected my computer from the internet. The game ran fine without the advertising and tracking. \nThen I connected back to the internet, and launched the game. The game opened at least 10 connections(!).\nThen, while still connected to the internet, I blocked the game's network-connecting executables in the firewall. In such a case, the game behaves differently, apparently it sees there is an active connection so it runs for a while, then when it cannot make it's for-bad-purposes network connections, it terminates and you can't play. \nThis is bad behavior that I would only expect from spyware and malware. I hope the vendor fixes it so the software runs in the manner they declare - it is supposed to not require network connectivity after the initial run as they describe in the System Requirements. \nSteam should be reigning in this behavior as well.\n- Before I begin, are you a fan of modern art? If no, I can safely say move on, this isn't the game for you. If yes, then you can appreciate that there is a lot of famous modern art. Some pieces you will find yourself drawn to and feel something about them, and others won't evoke any real response. This is true for most things in life, but we tend to try and find reasons why we feel a certain way about other mediums, while with art we are usually happy enough to admit the various factors like skill, materials used etc. don't really impact our overall opinion of the piece.\n\nKentucky Route Zero is an incredibly well made and obviously incredibly personal game, and the level of effort put into it is astonishing, and I didn't like it. I wish I liked it, it seems so much like something I should like, but I don't. The strangest thing is, I would call this the game's greatest triumph. \"Games as Art\" has been an ongoing debate for years, but artist's always make something for themselves, while most games are made to be enjoyed. The fact that I didn't like this but I can't actually pinpoint the reason is evidence that this might be something more than most other games in this space.\n\nI won't go on too much longer here because while I cannot recommend something I didn't enjoy, I do absolutely think anyone interested in narrative games try the first two acts. I did enjoy the first act and can recommend that with no reservations, but from the second act onwards my interest and patience just declined more and more. I have no problem with wordy games, I've played plenty of visual novels that took 50+ hours to complete, but here I feel more and more of the story was being told with blanks I was supposed to fill in, but I just wasn't engaged enough with the characters and setting to bother with that, so you can easily see how this would become more frustrating over time.\n\nI wouldn't change a thing about this game, to me that would be like asking a painter to add in a few more trees to a finished piece. This game exists as a piece of art. I didn't like it, but you might love it, and you might not be able say why either, and that's a big achievement.\n- Steam, for gods sake, give us a neutral recommendation button.\n\nSooo, long story short, the game is nice and has beautifull artwork. It´s also massivly too short. This are the only objective things I can say about it. \n\nNow to be a bit more real here. I bought this game, because I played another game like this, let´s call it \"Blue Sticks Bar\". And that game hooked me into this genre.\nNormally I´m someone who likes extensive interaction with a Games Story more than anything else. For this reason I hated TTG and similar stuff. But that Barkeeping game had such a complex Story and such good Characters that I fell in love with it and by extension the Genre.\n\nSo I got myself Coffee Talk. And boy oh boy let me tell ya, I´m seriously torn with this game. Partway through I thought I would give it a searing bad review. But then I played through it and noticed something. This game isn´t bad, just painfully average. And, I hate to say this, but I´m probably too mature for it.\n\nNow don´t get me wrong.\nSome things here are just wonderfull. The Artstyle? Fantastic (exept for a couple minor things)\nI´m guessing the music is also good if you like it.\n\nBut already there are cracks there. Something (mildly) dramatic is happening and some coffee house tunes are playing in the Background. It´s honestly just laughable.\nAnd that word is a great segway into talking about the Story. You know that moment when you´re browsing and find (mostly on Tumblr) some really cute little story idea? This is that the game. Problem is, that a Story that deals with, for example racism, growing up, PTSD and some other really serious matters can´t be as shallow as this.\n\nYou have to decide. Either you´re doing Babies first social awareness Storyline and leave out some of this stuff, OR you do a real mature story that I can´t sum up in one single sentence.\n\nI really want to like this Game. I´m a lonely little Geek, so a Story about interesting People in a Shadowrun-light Setting sounded right up my alley. But it was simply too dissappointing. \n\nI wouldn´t refund this game even if I could, since it had some good stuff in it. \nBut sadly I can´t recommend it.\n\n\nWow, I got through this all without swearing, nice one!\n- \"Do not ask, 'Is Pizza Tower worth my time?' Instead ask, 'Am I worth Pizza Tower's time?'\"\nSun Tzu- Art of War\n- Their last privacy agreement update (January 1st, 2021) states they will \"sell\" users information, including name, email and billing address to third party companies (including social media and advertising). There is no other way of playing the game without accepting those terms, very sad practices for a paid game really.\n- If I could get my money back, I would. AI as usual is hot garbage, cant even take turns without getting LITERALLY BODIED by the AI drivers. The new progression system really sucks. Cool that they wanted to try something different, but I really dont feel like leveling every god damn car in the game just to modify it. If you wanted multiple of same car you would have to level those duplicate cars you purchase. My experience with the physics is just... eh. I mean I sure do love loosing grip just from barely tapping the gas. Constantly fighting my wheel just to stay stable. Driving its probably fine for controller players, I wouldnt on wheel. Credits are only used to buy cars now. Also kinda runs like crap. All i wanted was a Gran Turismo on PC and this... this is not it. Game is mid, move on me thinks.\n\nEdit: I put in a request for a refund and Valve did indeed approve it. I thought I was over the time limit for sure. Don't be me and spend 100 USD for early access. Thanks Valve, you're the best!\n- For the past 4 years I couldn't get myself to finish a single game without having to force myself to do it(and even then I failed). I couldn't enjoy SP games no matter how good the gameplay or the story was. I kept buying games hoping to find that one game that would do the trick. This was FF XV for me. Despite of all my friends advising me against buying it because it was just going to be another game that would sit around in my library, I decided to give it a try.\n\nIt actually felt like I went back in time to when I could play SP games for hours without getting bored after an hour or two.\n\nI admit I skipped most sidequests and I'll try going back to them sooner or later, although it may not be the best game out there in terms of content(you can finish the game on easy skipping most secondary quests in about 20-25 hours) or story development, playing through it felt like a new experience. In fact, even after finishing the game there's still plenty of things to do and in my opinion, even playing it through again just to spend more time with Noctis and his friends is worth it.\n\nThe story is not mindblowing, the combat system is really fun but far from flawless, most sidequests aren't well written but at its core, at least for me, FF XV has something to it that other games lack. I can't say it magically restored my old passion for gaming but it has given me a reason to at least try to get into it again.\n\nIf you haven't played it yet I sincerely envy you, I would love to experience it all over again from the start, it has been a memorable journey to say the least and I hope that you are willing to give it a try. ^^\n- Falcom's Action RPG Masterpiece.\n\nbest story in the series. it follows the latest adventure of Adol and his companions, stranded in an island and slowly uncovering their secrets. the tight, but well developed cast are absolutely the best written characters in the series. from party member to your fellow castaways all have developed motivation, personality and charm. \n\nalot of the horribad translation and voice acting have been fixed, and it finally got the treatment it deserve as a masterpiece. \n\nthe gameplay is an evolution of the modern Ys game. at its core, ys 8 is an action RPG where you control adol and several other party members with unique set of skills, moveset, weapons and super attack. each character represent an attack type (slash, pierce, smash) that are pitted against various enemies with certain weaknesses. great variety of enemies, amazing boss battles, music and story. \n\non release, there seems to be a big problem for the port, but as far as i know, everything has been patched to very good level of stability. over 70 hours, the game crashed twice (and saved by the intuitive autosave system), run flawlessly 60 FPS and 1440p without a single slowdown. \n\n10/10 game go buy so we get monstrum nox on PC.\n- It may not be that similar to what most people are familiar with, as a building game, but in most every sense which counts, I believe this is the greatest building game I have ever played.\n\nThe controls are smooth, the Building Mechanics are smooth, the interplay of cuteness and silliness is so smooth, and Lillian has the cutest face in the known universe.\n\nTruly a fantastic game with enjoyable and concise mechanics, the Block Grid is as malleable as Minecraft (except that some areas cannot be mined, usually story quest locations), the ally AI is more involved than Conan (sitting at a table with Rosie to gobble some greens? cute), and the combat is slightly dangerous at first, but mostly very mellow and not in any way detrimental to the building side (the villagers even fix up the damage done to your village in story battles - at least in the 'tutorial' island).\n\nMy only advices:\n\n- If the Camera is too tight on you and too slow to zoom out, switch perspective and back, if that doesn't work, look down at the ground and jump a couple times! (your head will push the camera up into the sky faster)\n\n- Don't get too creative on Furrowfield Farm! I spent a lot of time building and customising, being slightly annoyed at the small build area of the island, but now I discover that the whole thing was essentially a tutorial, and that completing the story missions there opened up the game in a much bigger way. Now I am back on the home Island and am able to build across a much larger area. If you're still in Furrowfield, you basically haven't started the game yet, so get that story done!\n\n- IF YOU SUFFER FROM REGULAR COMPUTER OR PROGRAMME CRASHES:\nWhen loading a Game you can press (A) / (X) on Controller to Copy the Save File and Back it up on one of the other Save Slots. I recommend doing this every day you play in case of  Corrupted Save Data caused by Crashing while Sailing to another Island.\n\nI am tempted to give this game a 9/10 - which is a serious seal of approval from me. Even on my strictest day, I would never give it less than a 7 - it is fun, cute, silly, serious, touching, exciting, and above all else, architexcellent!\n- Classic Mortal Kombat with modern-day graphics & extra mechanics.\nA Fun Educational Game For learning more about the inner workings of the Human Body and Skeletal system.\nfamily friendly pg clean game for children!\n\nHere Is How To Fix The Crashing Problem! \n< Go to your library, click on MKX.\n> Locate the part that says \"DLC\", it should be right below the achievements.\n< You'll see Install pack 1 through 20 something.\n> Select all of them and they will begin to install manually.\n\nhope you enjoy playing.\nGood Luck🌹\n7.5/10\n- So Epic takes over, breaks the game, can't connect to the Epic Services so I can't play, takes away garage items, and then Steam blocks new reviews due to \"off topic\" review activity unless you change the settings manually. Went from a game a played daily to a game I literally can't play. Epic can go blow themselves.\n- WTF, this isn’t gaming! Where are my lootboxes and micro transactions?!\n\nMy main thought after I beat GRIS was, \"I don't really understand anything that just happened, but it sure was pretty.\"\n\nI was absolutely amazed how a game with zero actual dialogue could move me to tears, just on strenght of its visuals and music. In general, the whole theme of dealing with grief/depression spoke to me in a way that I didn't expect.  It's one of those games you play to \"feel\" more than for the gameplay itself.\n\nI have PTSD from dealing with my wife getting a boyfriend, and this game made me cry several times while playing it. Especially during the scene where you're swimming away from the eel. That symbolism to me perfectly captures the feeling of trauma recovery. I'd spent time finding the little lights throughout that section of the game and activating the turtle which ultimately saved me from my own darkness and helplessness.\n\nIt felt like hope. It was such a good representation of how the coping skills I'd learned and the hard work I'd put in were finally seeming to pay off. It's when you're at your weakest that you learn how strong you actually are. I cried like a baby during and after that scene. It made me realize how much I've actually overcome, and how grateful I am to be free.\n\nGris truly is a beautiful game and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a slow paced experience. The only bit of criticism I have for the game is it certainly gives \"not like the other girls\" vibes at times, but I think this is quite easy to get over.\n\nIn conclusion: the visuals are stunning,  the music is beautiful and knows exactly when to kick in, the platforming elements are fantastic, and it’s story and themes are spectacular without a single word. Truly a must-play.\n\n10/10\n- Besides the rocky and terrible launch of this game, then the atrocious \"balance\" changes, now your making a DLC that costs as much as the game? Is it a whole new game? The answer is no, and even if it was, the way you handled this games issues makes me wish I could refund this game and remove your games from showing in my store. I hope no one buys the DLC honestly, I know at least I won't.\n\nIf you want a review of the game, yes, they did seem to iron out most of the issues, however since I haven't played in quite awhile due to me spending too much time apparently gearing my techromancer just to come back and am unable to handle what I could before the \"balancing\", has turned me away from this game. Reducing a classes viability or power in a PVE/CO-OP game boggles my mind. It's like saying, \"Oh you don't like the other classes since they do less damage and are harder to accomplish the same goals? Well let me crush your class into the ground so they all feel the same. Have fun!\"\n- holy fucking shit everything about this fucking mongoloid game is so fucking bad i can't even begin to understand. this was supposed to be better than the first piece of shit, but i dunno, maybe a tiny bit.\n\ndon't be like me and get baited into wasting your hard earned money for this fucking shit even if it's on like -90% sale.\n\nspecial mention to worst fucking controls in the history of fucking gaming. fuck these fucking mongoloid fucking retard faggots for making a game this fucking bad. uninstalled.\n- The game balances out and improves on everything from the original KoF2002. \nThat said, this is a bit more fast-paced than other KoF games. If you've played KoF98, this one is faster and more combo heavy. If you've played 13, this one has a higher bar for executing combos. If you're coming from XI, this one doesn't have the tag system. Those are the most important changes from other popular KoF games.\n- ironic that the best sonic game was the one not made by sonic team\n- Fun JRPG with some action commands thrown in, good variety of enemies, and a pretty decent skill development tree.\n\nEnemies can feel pretty tough later in the game, but its more of a puzzle when trying to complete these fights so it doesn't feel cheap.\n\nGreat soundtrack too.\n\nRuns great on Steamdeck\n- This is like, the End of Evangelion of RPGmaker games.\n- This game taught me about the diversity of cultures that our small little corner of the universe offers.\n\nThen it taught me to hate them all.\n- [b][u] TL;DR[/u] [/b] Finally finish the fight on PC after 13 years.\n[b][u] Long version: [/u] [/b]\n[h1] Halo Combat Evolved Anniversary: [/h1] The very first halo with remastered visuals but the same gameplay. 20 years old now, the level design can sometimes become repetitive. Especially on the library mission. The remastered visuals look nice but I find that it deviates way too much from the original vision of Bungie. You can switch between the old and new graphics with a press of a button. \nOverall a smooth [b][i] Wort out of 10 with a touch of \"this cave is not a natural formation\".[/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Halo 2 Anniversary: [/h1] The second game in the series and the last one for the PC until 15 years later with the release of MCC. The game has remastered visuals as well as fully CGI remastered cutscenes. The remastered visuals are really well done and true to the original artwork and the CGI cutscenes are top notch with quality that can easily surpass the CGI level of some movies. Same gameplay from 15 years ago but it surprisingly holds up pretty well. I did experience some stuttering on this game ever so often but that could just be my system. Again you can switch between the classic and remastered graphics with the press of a button. Even during cutscenes. Just don't shake the light bulb. \nIn summary, I'd give this game a [b][i] Wort Wort Wort out of 10 with a slight slight tinge of heresy. [/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Halo 3: [/h1] The magnum opus of Bungie and the big final conclusion to the halo trilogy. The port to PC was a decent port (well it better be after 13 years!) with little to no technical issues. I faced a desync issue during co-op play on a specific mission until I locked my framerate to 60 fps. I tried to replicate the issue again later on but I had no luck reproducing it. If only were it so easy.\nThe gameplay is similar but sometimes bigger in scale than halo 2 and holds up well. The visuals have not been remastered for halo 3 but they still look good for what they are. \nI give this game a [b][i] Wort in the Wort out of 10. Wake me when you need me. [/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Halo 3 ODST: [/h1] Halo ODST takes place during the events of Halo 2 and follows a squad of Orbital Drop Shock Troppers that get deployed to New Mombasa. It uses the same engine as Halo 3 and so the fidelity isnt much a leap from Halo 3 but the art style is drastically different and takes on a noir style with washed out colors. Kinda reminds me a little bit of Deus ex Human Revolution tbh. Even more so because of its semi open world/hub design.\nThe PC port is as good as Halo 3 if not better and I didn't face any issues. \nThis is a solid [b][i] how many engineers did you murder before dare asked out of 10. [/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Halo Reach: [/h1] Halo Reach would be the final halo game that would be developed by Bungie. Ironically, this game was the first to release for the MCC on PC and is also chronologically the first in the timeline of the main series. Quite frankly the port was not very good. It had audio issues, visual downgrades and many more problems. However in time, 343 has corrected almost all of these issues and now it is a great port to PC. Reach takes place before the events of Halo Combat Evolved and is a prequel to the entire series. It puts you into the shoes of Noble Six, a member of Noble Team that are tasked to... well I wont spoil everything here. Just know that you're stepping into some shoes the rest of the squad would rather leave unfilled. \nThe artstyle is a grittier and more grim depiction of the halo universe and fits well within the narrative of the game. \nThis game gets a [b][i] pair of gúta out of 10 from me. [/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Halo 4: [/h1] After Bungie stepped down as developers of the halo franchise, the mantle was given to 343 industies to carry on the legacy of Halo. The very first game by 343i came in the form of Halo 4 and would be a direct sequel to the conclusion of the Halo trilogy in Halo 3. \nThe change in team came with it, the change in art style, level design and gameplay loop. I will just call this change \"different\". \nThe port to PC is pretty decent aside from some stuttering I faced during coop play. \nOverall this game is a [b][i] 343 out of 10 unless you get on the bad side of Cortana. [/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Multiplayer, Firefight and Spartan Ops: [/h1]\nEach game has its own multiplayer except for Halo 3 ODST. The multiplayer itself is fun and they have enabled cross-play between platforms making finding matches easier.\nThere are so many multiplayer game modes within each game and covering them all is beyond the scope of this short review. :) \nThere are your traditional TDM, Big Team Battle, Capture the flag and such; but there are also interesting and odd game types which are a good change of pace.\nAs for the multiplayer progression, there is a battlepass system in place where you can unlock various cosmetics such as armor parts, gun skins and vehicle skins for each game.\nThe game is updated with seasons that add more features and cosmetics.\nAlthough the idea of a battlepass may put some of us off, the system is completely free and you dont miss out on previous seasons as they are all accessible indefinitely.\nYou can even pick and choose which seasons to progress in.\nIf you want some co-op within multiplayer, then Halo Reach and Halo 3 ODST have a mode called firefight where you have to fend off wave after wave of enemies with changing modifiers or mutations. \nAn alternative to firefight is Spartan Ops, a game mode exclusive to Halo 4. It is a cooperative campaign(you can solo) where you get to use your customised spartan from multiplayer. Keep in mind that although there is a set narrative here, the quality of production in spartan ops is nowhere near the level as that of the main Halo 4 campaign.\n\nOverall the multiplayer, firefight and spartan ops are solid additions to the already superb collection of 6 campaigns. The only thing missing right now is a custom server browser which I believe is in the works. \nEDIT: They have added in a custom server browser for Halo Reach, Halo: Combat Evolved, Halo 2 and Halo 3! :D\n\n[h1] Forge and Theatre: [/h1] \nForge is where you can fool around with various kinds of halo props and items within maps and make your own creations that you can share with others. It has basically endless content.\nJust a cherry on top over all the other content that you are getting with the collection. Forge is available for Halo 2 anniversary, Halo 3, Halo Reach and Halo 4.\nTheatre mode is exactly what it sounds like. Record clips from the game and play them back later with a free form camera. Perfect for content creation. \n\n[h1] Modding: [/h1]\nAs if there wasn't already so much content in the vanilla game, Halo MCC allows you run the game in anti cheat free mode, where you can install and play community created mods.\nGoes without saying that this will only age like fine wine.\n\n[h1] Well that's it folks: [/h1]\nYou mad lads that made it up to here; thank you for reading the ramblings of a mad man. \nDustin Echoes will forever watch over you.\n- Dave the Diver is a charming little 'Indie'* that still surprises you with new mechanics even hours in. The various activity cutscenes are pretty funny as well.\n\nJust a word of warning though. Mintrocket is NOT a indie studio, it's a subsidiary of NEXON, so DtD is entirely a NEXON game, and with how their reputation is it's pretty understandable to not buy this game just because of that.\n- A criminally underrated game, I have seldom seen a developer take their original hit which was already almost perfect, and actually manage to improve on it in every way shape and form. You do not need to have played the original to play or enjoy this game. Their stories are completely seperate.\n\nThe game itself is much less linear than its predecessor. The best way I can explain the feeling of going through the environments without referencing Grimrock itself is by saying it felt an awful lot like Myst to me, just with combat. Required puzzles for progression were challenging but not impossible, some of the secret challenges were much more difficult. I admit I used an online guide more than a few times, but it did nothing to diminish my enjoyment of the game. It is immersive, challenging, and satisfying. \n\nThe only drawback I can think of is the difficulty. It feels like you cannot win with any group composition, I suggest no more than 2 of any class or weapon/armor type user. I went with a warrior, two rogues(one range), and a mage, this way you as well makes you unlikely to complete a difficult fight or puzzle and be rewarded with something you cannot use. Combat itself can be challenging as I said, but you will rarely feel like you are simply incapable of winning. There are obvious ways to optimize the way you approach an encounter the second time if you die the first.\n\nBe prepared to immerse yourself, you must pay attention to your surroundings, read and remember notes you find, explore every nook and cranny you can find, and you will be rewarded. Good luck!\n\n- Civ 5, Heroes of Might and Magic had a baby together and that baby grew up and had a baby with Endless Space and this baby has now grown up and it is glorious in every level.\n\nIncredibly polished, incredibly neat, incredibly addictive and a game that stands out from the rest. If you like Empire-builders, this game is for you!\n\nIgnore the \"Early access\". This game is ready to be sold. I have only experienced one single bug in this game and the MP works like a clockwork. It's highly optimised, full of features and pretty to look at. I wish more Devs would make their games this way, it warms my heart!\n- The British Forces give the Allies a bit of the German defensive capacities. It has the problem of adding too many buildings to a game that is, in its core, dynamic and based on movement and aggressiveness instead of turtling. The British units are diverse and interesting, bringing much to the table. \n\nThe DLC lacks a proper campaign for the Brits, unfortunately, even though Caen, Goodwood, Arnhem and Walcheren could have been done in some interesting missions. But, for a game focused on multiplayer, the Tommies are obligatory in everybody's library.\n- Great game! \nLooking foward for the next chapters of the game!\nI love the spritework, its amazing!\nEven the music is very catchy and memorable \nFor an Early Access game, this game is very charsimatic and has tons of personality!\n\nIts just a shame that it was short in my opinion, i know you are going to add more stuff obviously, but i was hoping to get much more out of it because i loved it alot xD.\n\nPirate Software, I can't stress enough how much my excitement for this game is,  the demo back in 2017 already left me intrigued, but now im excited to see how this all plays out!\n- I love this game. In fact, I've loved it since I was in highschool about 8 years ago. My friend and I used to play this game together all the time on my flashdrive. We were always discussing & trying to understand the ins-&-outs of the game and how to get a specific ending depending on what you did. Playing this brought me back to those good times in that library.\n\nThe OSTs are nostalgic, the gameplay is about the same and the artwork is amazing as ever(actually the graphics are much better with this remake).\nThe only complaint I have is that it lags at random times(though usually in the menu). The original IB on RPGMaker never did that.\nOverall I'm glad I bought this so I could support the Dev and thank them for all those years of entertainment-\nI just wish there wasn't so much lag over an RPGMaker game.\n- [h1] 8.5/10 [/h1]\n\n[b] Please note that The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles is a very independent entry in the Ace Attorney series in terms of plot. Even if you have not played any of the Ace Attorney titles before, it will not affect your understanding of the game's plot. [/b]\n\nThis courtroom text adventure game in late 19th century Japan and British have a lot of features, even with the previous Ace Attorney works are very different. With the detailed character costumes and backgrounds, the strong sense of history and atmosphere, the majestic music, and excellent characterization, along with the game's detailed 3D character animation, players can experience an unprecedented adventure. In the plot, The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles presents a layer-by-layer, cocooning type of plot development, each chapter of the story is closely linked, and ambiguous, no chapter is meaningless, and in the final unraveling of all the mystery, the feeling of shock and excitement brought to the player is unprecedented in any text adventure game.\n\nThe reviews of The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles tend to be polarized, and not without reason. The progression of the plot brings with it an overwhelming lack of tension in the first and middle stages of the game. The design of many of the cases in the game seems rather undisciplined, neither interesting nor deep... The Great Ace Attorney: Adventure, as the first half of the game, though the development of the subsequent plot paved a lot of ambushes, the design of the plot and puzzles makes it less interesting and often difficult to motivate players to continue playing. The climax of the game comes too late, whether the player can persist to this point is a huge problem. At the same time, the Steam version of the game globally locks 30 frames, and can not set the Japanese voice is also a very huge drawback, and very damaging to the player's gaming experience.\n\nThe quality of The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles is actually not that bad. But this can only be concluded after you have experienced the entire game in its entirety... And I think this is actually the biggest drawback of this game because the ability to keep the player until the climax of the plot is the biggest pain point of this work. If you are very patient, love the Ace Attorney series, and love the suspenseful story of players, then The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles will not let you down. If you do not have any of the above elements, perhaps The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles will not give you a memorable experience.\n- Stephen's Sausage Roll is a game that the developer doesn't want normal people to buy, it seems. The description is literally, \"A simple 3d puzzle game.\", there is one video that shows you nothing about the game, and it's priced at $32 CND.\n\nFortunately, I'm here to tell you to get off your ass and to buy this wonderful game. The graphics are alright, the music is OK, but the puzzles are sublime.\n\nIn each level, the goal is the same: cook all the sausages and exit the level by standing on the exit level sign in the right orientation. You cook sausages by pushing them over a grill. Like in sokoban games, you can't pull the sausage (yet...), only push it. Another huge wrinkle is that sides of the sausage can only touch the grill once. If you touch a cooked side of a sausage to the grill, it will be burned and you fail the level. This little wrinkle will make you pull your hair out in some levels as you try and figure out how the hell you are going to maneuver the sausages around so they get cooked properly. A neat thing about the game is that if you fail, you can still continue playing the level, which might help you figure out how to play it.\n\nYou'll have a section (part of an island) that has a number of puzzles for you to solve in any order, so if you get stuck, you can try another one (until you get to the last puzzle of the section). Once you complete a section, a new section will open up with more puzzles.\n\nYour little guy has tank controls, which you will find extremely useful, as turning to the left or right near a sausage will push it in different directions. A nice detail is that the all of the puzzles make up the island section. When you activate a puzzle, the rest of the island drops away into the sea, leaving you on a tiny puzzle island.\n\nEach section introduces new mechanics into the game. First you'll just be pushing the sausages, but then you'll be stacking them, skewering them (you would think this would make things easier, but no! You can't turn when you have a skewered sausage!), walking on them...\n\nI would say that these levels are on the level of Snakebird, though I found many of them easier than Snakebird's puzzles (maybe I'm better at sokoban games than I know?). These are the kind of puzzles that you walk away from frustrated, but come back to a few hours later with the solution. This is the game where there are so many ah-ha! moments that make you feel smart. You have no idea what to do at first, but eventually you get better and better. You might not see solutions at first, but you begin to see where you need to go to solve the puzzle, and then work backwards from there. It's wonderful!\n\nIf you're having trouble, there's a community guide that has all the solutions, which is super helpful (though not as much when I was playing because it wasn't complete!).\n\nIt might be expensive, but I took 36 hours to solve all the puzzles and it was worth every penny.\n- Plants, please: A horticultural document thriller.\nGlory to Undermere.\nPros: \n- the writing and its illusion of effortless brilliance\n- attention to detail and consequences for player actions\n- \"gotta catch 'em all\" mentality that actually makes you feel smart\n- the intrigue, world-building, and game flow\n- petting the cat\n\nCons: I wish there was more music, or just none at all most of the time.\n- Open world exploration by design, pants soiling horror by incident. Blends the concepts of innate human fear of deep water and unknown danger with constant, all pervading curiosity.\n\nYou have to dive deeper. You have to know what's down there.\n- Not really that great of a game. It's fairly unengaging, very slow paced, impossible boss fights just a few hours in. Unless you like games that requre hours of picking plants to craft potions you rub on your sword to give you 3 minutes of attack boost to be able to do any damage, side quest grinding, boring activites, and the general RPG stat grinding, skip this one and just get the Witcher 3 which is a game magnitudes better. CD Projeck Red really made the Witcher and Withcer 2 for the hardcore RPG fans. The experience just isn't worth the time investment on this one in my opinion. Not going to finish it and just go enjoy the third game instead.\n\nEDIT: \nTR;DR: A mediocre hack-n-slash that has been dummed down from the predeccesor for consoles.\n- First off, just want to say this isn't a Metroidvania. This is a Zelda clone. And a good one!\n\nI bought this game because I heard it really put stress on you. You have limited time to complete the game and NPCs will begin dying if you aren't fast enough. Pretty crazy, right? Well, I do have a few gripes with that, but let me point out the good stuff first:\n+ Amazing combat. You have access to both guns and swords, but most of your damage will likely come from melee weapons since they have the ability to do an extremely-easy-to-pull-off PARRY! Parrying an enemy stuns it and gives your next attack against it a massive damage multiplier. All enemies, all bosses, and most projectiles are parryable, so this is what combat ends up revolving around. Even though I call it easy, you still get that cool feeling when you walk into an ambush and clear it without taking a hit, so it never gets dull as you go through the game.\n\n+ Good dungeon design. Since this game takes after Zelda, it's not shy about inserting a few puzzles into its dungeons. The overworld as well has quite a few surprising secrets and side quests that you won't be expecting when you play for the first time.\n\n+ Sequence breaks. This is mostly for New Game+ (or New Game Extra, a separate mode where you have access to major exploration items from the start, but not your whole endgame inventory), but it was interesting to find out how many secret paths and shortcuts there were, and how tightly they were managed. The devs thought of everything!\n\nSo now for the bad stuff.\n- Underwhelming story. Guess how much is really explained over the course of this story. If you guessed \"all of it\", you would be completely wrong and here's your dunce hat. Unsighted ends up spending so much of its time on the protagonist's relationships that it fails to answer several of the more important questions concerning the game's backstory. Why was there was a war? Who started it? Where are the humans now? Why are they so disorganized? Why do they seem to have no chain of command whatsoever? How did the automatons ever win anything at all at any point when they seem so extremely outclassed? I guess it doesn't matter. Look, there's two robot-girls kissing.\n\n- Fake pressure. I heard there was going to be pressure before I started the game, so I decided to go DEFCON 1 from the get-go and rush everything. I ended up completing the game in 10 in-game days and I felt pretty good about it. Zero NPC deaths! Zero! I'm a super awesome amazing hero, right? Well, credits roll and... the only achievement I get is the one for beating the game. No one really cares and apparently you're meant to play through multiple times anyway. So... why did I ever care? Why is this mechanic even in the game? All it did was make me shy away from general exploration and side quests since all of those things are less important than, ya know, saving the world. You can call that interesting, but when it has no payoff, it ends up being frustrating.\n\n- No post-game. Did I mention, if you bumrush the game and finish with just hours left on everyone's timers, you don't get to do any extra no-timer exploring afterwards? No, the game's over. Load the save and you get set back to where you were before fighting the final boss. If you want to do any actual exploring, that's what \"Explorer\" mode is for. You know, that mode that makes you feel like you're cheating?\n\nBasically, Unsighted is another game filled with missed opportunities. I recommend this game because the core gameplay and level design is very well done and very well executed, but you should probably know this before you start:\n\nThe only pressure here is the one you imagine. Since the game does nothing to acknowledge your successes, just play it at your own pace and don't be shy about using Explorer. Shame on the devs for hailing the agony of defeat, but not the thrill of victory.\n- Medium performance issues (as of 2/28/22) but GOTY game. This game is amazing and absolutely dripping with content. FromSoft didn't make Dark Souls 4. This game is Dark Souls 4, 5, and 6 all in one. Absolutely massive game and the open world part doesn't feel like an attempt to pad the game like most games, here's why:\n- Picking up items in the open world doesn't have a pickup animation. This might not seem like a lot but go play something like Dragon Age: Inquisition and you'll know what I'm talking about.\n- You can pick up items while on horseback (also no animation), Greatly speeds up looting while in the open world\n- Summoning pools makes getting summoned for bosses is easier than ever. All you have to do is be in the same general overworld location as a pool and all location get a summon sign\n- Sooooo many more bonfire locations. Can also fast travel from almost anywhere using the in-game map.\n- packed with stuff to do. Very rarely are you walking/riding for long periods before running into a dungeon/boss/camp/npc/etc. Every single side location has something to discover, Plus you never know what you're going to get and the feeling of discovery is unlike any other game out there.\n\nThere are a lot of improvements over previous installments as well. In no particular order, here are some of my standouts:\n- POWERSTANCING IS BACK BABYYYYY. Was always my favorite thing from DS2.\n- Slottable weapon arts. Taking the weapon art system from DS3 and making it even better. This system is also tied to the weapon affinity system which allows you to switch up the scaling of a weapon at any bonfire. No more committing to a specific element or stat.\n- The open world makes the game more accessible. Hit a wall with one zone? Just go somewhere else and come back when stronger. Sekiro had this a little but this game it's extremely pronounced.\n- The statues of Marika make it so the runbacks for bosses is not nearly as grueling. These statues work as \"respawn only\" bonfires that you can choose to respawn back at and are usually just outside a boss fight room after a lengthy run. You can't rest at them or adjust your build there, but they prevent the grueling runback and allow you to smash your face into a boss over and over with minimal downtime.\n- Having a dedicated jump button but keep the power of jump attacks. Risky usually, but can also be used as a counter to low swinging attacks. This also adds into the next system of...\n- Poise breaking enemies. Is done by heavy attacking, jump attacking and guard countering. Adds even more move types to the game and makes every weapon a totally different playstyle and adds to the replay value.\n- What are guard counters? After successfully blocking and attack, you can follow it up with a special heavy attack that has high poise damage. Allows for more critical hits. You might think this makes it easier but it takes more skill than you'd think to time these ripostes and it always feels good.\n\nAs with any game, it's not for everyone, but if you love souls games, you'd be doing yourself a disservice by missing this one. If you've never played a souls game, this is the best one to try. The most accessible by far. No crazy hard tutorial bosses, the new ashen summoning bell gives some great support in difficult areas, and the fact you can always leave harder fights and come back to them later makes it so you rarely run into situations where you know booting up the game means you're gonna be brick walling until either the boss dies or you give up.\n- Never understood why everybody started hating this game.\nFirst it was too hard, so dev made it easier.\nThen it was too clunky, so dev remade the UI again and again (it's still not perfect though but I saw big improvements overtime).\nThen it was another thing and another one and no matter what dev team did, people were still mad at them ...\nI did enjoy this game since the beginning, I adapted each time the game changed and yet people kept whining because it wasn't exactly how they felt it shoud have been.\nAfter all this hard work and still getting pooped in the face, the dev team left ... how strange, right ?\n\nI'm not mad at the dev team, but I'm so sad that people can't understand that making others miserable because they don't have exactly what they want (and having paid for it is no excuse to this behavior in my opinion) will make them give up on their task ...\n\nFor what it's worth, I miss you Handyman team :(, but thank you anyway for the actual game cause I really don't feel that I've been robbed and I still enjoy it from time to time.\n- I love skyrim, but please stop hiding it on steam, i don't want to buy a £30 game i can get for £10 anywhere else. Also stop hiding the DLC's! For anyone who isn't able to get access to the DLC store pages i went through the trouble of finding them, heres the links:\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/211720/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim__Dawnguard/\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/226880/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim__Dragonborn/\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/220760/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim__Hearthfire/\nIf you don't wanna pay full price for the DLC's go to cdkeys and get the legendary edition for £5.99, if you already own the game it's not a problem it will just add the DLC's to your library.\nhttps://www.cdkeys.com/the-elder-scrolls-v-5-skyrim-legendary-edition-pc\n\n- This game will leave you satisfied.\n\nI know that doesn't sound like much of a selling point, but it is. This game won't give you a sequal hook, it won't give you a product carved away like a thanksgiving turkey, each part sold seperately or held to ransom. \n\nThis is not a game about standing victorious over your enemies, it's not a game with some kind of adrenal rush that will leave you drained and empty afterwards.\n\nThis isn't a game about saving the world, as surprising as that may sound considering the hero's goal.\n\nThis is a game about hope. Hope for tomorrow, hope for your fellow man, hope for dreams and wishes, hope for a last shimmer of light in the encroaching darkness.\n\nThis is a game that will make you ask things about yourself, even if only subconciously. \n\nBut, most importantly of all, this is an experience that will make you say \"I was happy to be there, if only for a time.\"\n\nAnd I was, in fact, happy to be here.\n\nHats off to you ladies and gentlemen, you made a cyinical old bastard smile for a good ten hours.\n- ULTRAKILL is a fine game with cool movement mechanics. However most of the guns don't feel beefy at all and, really, there's not much content to be had. Wait for ACT 3 before forking out $20 for this.\n\nedit: after getting every p rank, gaming\n- The game is decent but not worth $15 for a slightly better looking version of a 2 hour game that is 9 years old. I can only recommend it if you really like these kind rpg maker horror games, because it's among the best in its field.\n- Stunning pixel art platformer where you will travel through different eras fighting hordes of enemies even using the ability to change time! Super recommended, a must try if you like platformers!\n- Just look at my game time if you wanna know how passionate I am about this game\n- Always have to be online, even to play single player. Why?\n\nThis would be a perfect Steam Deck game, but they fucked it up.\n\nUPDATE OCT 20th: So they added off-line mode just for Steam Deck, which is great, but not allowing off-line mode on your PC is strange. Hopefully they update it again.\n\n【グループB】\n- Only originally bought this to support the artist, since I'm a huge fan of his pixel art work. It's amazing, and there's a tonne of eye candy to fill your eyeballs with. However, I can't recommend this to everyone as after the first few hours it's become a bit of a chore.\n\n- The game is a \"clicker\" type with rpg/upgrade elements. It's too slow to play in the background/absent mindedly but not fast enough to keep your attention fully.\n- Each round/attempt at a boss takes way too goddamn long. \n- Barely any interaction with the world. You build tower defense style, and equip new items, but beyond that you don't have any special abilities, no \"oh shit\" once per loop power, no ability to target specific enemies, nothing. Just watch everything play out and hope your little guy doesn't get pulped.\n- Crafting/Supplying is sort of hidden away and if you don't know about dismantling you'll never grind out all the items you need to build new stuff.\n- Lore/Journal entries are hidden away and require resources to unlock using a little button on the bottom of the screen that's easy to miss. I only found it 20 hours in. The writing is cringey and obviously done by someone who probably enjoys Adam Sandler films.\n- The card system is a neat idea, but jesus christ there's too much garbage shuffling. Imagine playing MtG with a deck of 100 cards and 90 of them are lands, and everytime you get a new hand you reshuffle the whole deck so all you get is more lands. Oblivion (destroys a tile) rarely, if ever, pops up. \n- Character skills are kinda bad? You might get a good one every level (which again, takes forever) but half the time it'll be useless \"leave 10% of food/resources at camp\" when you're not doing a resource grind run.\n- So much trash equipment you have to sort through and breaks game flow.\n\nAnd the biggest \"don't recommend\" from me would be the issue with how combining tiles works. If you put two tiles beside each other they sometimes change the tiles to something else. Example - put a Vampire Mansion beside a Village and you get a town full of ghouls that after 3 loops around the map turns into an upgraded town. But you still get trash equipment from the quests it gives, and putting a Vampire Mansion beside any other type of town doesn't change that town at all. So there's no reason to experiment, and it really limits the gameplay. You'd think they'd focus on that aspect gameplay wise, especially with experimentation to get the most bonuses out of all your tiles... but no. There's a small list of things that interact with each other, and that's it.\n\nI still highly recommend it since the game is cheap, the art is amazing and the artist/indie devs should get support. But I think it's a good 2-3 major updates, expansions or fan modding away from getting really, really amazing.\n- if we showed this to senators in the 90's video games would be banned today\n- the game itself is pretty ok and fun for what it is, and runs great on deck. but man, F**K THE ALWAYS-ONLINE-DRM WHICH AT TIMES TAKES AGES TO CONNECT, GETTING THE GAME STUCK IN THE MENU WITH NOTHING TO DO!!\n\n>> Update after 20h played:\nI really enjoy playing the game. It is good, it is fun and runs great on the Steam Deck, which is especially important to me, as I tend to travel a lot as part of my job.\n\nThat being said, however, is core of the issue: The Always-On-DRM actually prevents me from playing this game on the go. Having this sort of DRM is, in my opinion, only predatory and inexcusable in any way. I get that the online-components of the game will not work when I am on the move, but I am mainly interested in the single player experience, from which I am also locked out. I am even locked out of the main menu without a stable internet collection, which is just ridiculous.\n- Do NOT buy this game! This game does not even have a minimap/GPS/coordinate system. You will definitely get lost.\nMultiplayer is fully of bug and lags so much.\nDo NOT buy this game!\nDo NOT buy this game!\nDo NOT buy this game!\n\nThis game is so f*** stupid\n- While still a work very much in progress, Nuclear Throne is currently one of my favorite games. It's a roguelike dungeon crawler with heavy \"bullet-hell\" elements and a little RPG sprinkled on top. When you begin a session of Nuclear Throne, you choose from one of several well-designed & freakish \"mutants\", each with their own special attributes which, in itself, does much to add variety (there's also a random-select option which is a fun idea in this particular case). The goal of each stage is to exterminate all of the enemies. After doing so, a portal opens which takes your mutant freak to the next level. There are a great many weapons with which to inflict meyhem on your adversaries. As you gain experience points, in the form of green goo earned by killing enemies & also found in cache jars, you'll be able to choose new persistent perks for your character (such as more HP or certain weapons doing more damage). Every so-often, you'll encounter a boss. The bosses tend to pop in during the height of an already-in-progress battle which makes beating them all-the-more difficult & hectic.\n\nOriginally, this game did not have controller support which was a great disappointment (though I had been ejoying it anyway, using the keyboard and mouse). However, a recent update rectified this and the gameplay using a dual-analog controller (such as that of the Xbox 360) is just fantastic. Like Ultratron before it (another very similar game which is also worth a look; I also wrote a review for it, if you're interested in checking it out), Nuclear Throne throws you straight back to the arcades of yore and plops you in front of a Smash TV cabinet.\n\nAs a roguelike dungeon-crawler, the replay value is extremely high (due to the fact that the level and enemy layout is totally different from one session to the next). The rather extreme difficulty doesn't hurt either, as playing entails dying and thus restarting... a lot. Fortunately, said difficulty isn't of the variety that compels you to smash your controller/keyboard in frustration. Every death feels like the fault lay squarely on *your* shoulders (if only you had moved to dodge a little faster or conserved ammo a little better!), as opposed to the game feeling like it's cheating. Another stand-out feature which I think I need to bring up is the soundtrack. ...Just wow! Nuclear Throne's score is totally original and extremely surreal. It goes *miles* in lending its own atmosphere to the game. \n\nSome might consider the current price of $12.99 to be just a *little* steep for a game in this class, but considering how well it's made overall and the fun I've gotten from it (especially being in its currently pre-release/beta state), I consider it to be well worth the price. As of the time of this writing, the developer(s) is very active and updates are coming quite frequently.\n\nUPDATE 01/12/16: I hadn't played this game in quite a while (at least 6+ months) and I wanted to check out the progress that the devs have made, etc. Well... The game starts but as soon as I select a character, it totally locks up. I can't play it at all. To make matters worse, I've heard that the devs have since \"abandoned\" development of this game (so it's not likely that whatever is causing the crashes for me is going to be fixed any time soon - or ever). Bummer man. I loved this game...\n- To be honest, this game is a bit of an acquired taste. At first I didn't get it: Few options to customize your army, at the beginning of a battle every unit has its predetermined place on the map, there's an unforgiving time limit to reach your objectives and the graphics could be much better. The first encounters with an entrenched enemy ended in a bloodbath for my units, despite overall superiority in numbers and total command of the air. And when I learned that you don't necessarily keep your veteran units after a successful battle but sometimes have to start the next scenario with new ones, I came close to deleting the game.\n\nLuckily, I  didn't. Like any decent strategy-game, UOCII takes some time to learn. The game's mechanics and its reliance on logistics are the main differences to most others I've played. The first lesson: Your success depends heavily on understanding both your own and the enemy's supply network. Finding his vulnerable spots while protecting your own is elementary. Once you figured out where to strike and with which units, your chances improve dramatically. The AI is quite good and will help you find your own weak spots soon enough – a single forgotten enemy in your rear can easily stop the most impressive offensive, if it decides to block the one railway line supporting all your units and your HQ. +-To make things more interesting, the game relies on Headquarters, which you have to move around together with your regular units. These HQ can and must be improved over time to learn additional “skills” like bridge-building, special orders, emergency supply etc. During a battle, they must be kept within range of your units to be effective, giving the game a bit of an role-playing-aspect: One or several generals moving around, each commanding a part of your force, never too close to the firing line, all the while learning new skills and helping your units to do a limited number of special tricks. Nice flavour.\n\nI could write a lot more, but to sum it up: UOCII is a really rewarding strategy-game with some new and interesting features I haven't found anywhere else. It's not perfect – more options to customize or to place units would be welcome and the difficulty in some of the later DLCs is quite brutal -  but all in all it's very much worth its price. Still enjoy it after several years and look forward to the next DLC (Africa) :-)\n- Blows every single PFS game of the last decade out of the water, even those shitty D**M games that people who never played FPS games before seems to worship in order to look cool. Smooth and fast gameplay with a lot of variety. Great visuals even on medium/high settings. Story and writing is shit but pretty much on the same level as rest of the Borderlands series with the exception of the Telltale one. Writing has always been the worst part of the series, dont be delusional retards.\n- The game vaguely reminds me of Yume Nikki and Strange Telephone due to thematic similarities, but in the end, I think it managed to be something completely different - I don't want to compare it directly to Undertale, but I got those narrative vibes as well. Unlike its exploration-based relatives, UNREAL LIFE is somewhat of a linear game, but the areas tend to loop around into the hub when using waypoints, occasionally involving some backtracking and optional achievements (including a game within a game). It took me about 6 hours to get 2 bad endings on the same playthrough, that said I am missing more than half of the achievements and probably other endings as well. Despite its modest art style, I think the locations and the world design were very good, granted the game settings are very limited for the price. The writing and characters were the highlight of the experience for me, I would say I enjoyed about 95% of the dialogue and world-building, despite being a very text-heavy game. The game tells a story in a unique way where the character can extract memories from the objects that she touched, unlocking potential hints that you will need to solve puzzles.\n\nYour room works as a hub area to which you can return for manual saves or the minigame, additionally to connecting all areas with a waypoint system, but you don't have to worry too much about those as the checkpoints are very frequent. Generally, the gameplay is just exploring 2D levels, picking up items, and occasionally solving creative sequence puzzles. The character keeps track of 3 different memories that may contain clues if you managed to miss them - it's hard to do because the important text is color-coded. I want to give the devs credit for actually putting some originality into puzzle mechanics, they were fun and not difficult enough to drag the game down. However, when the character learns about a hidden item from the memory, you have to click in the correct spot with no indication, which is perfectly fine, I only wish I realized it sooner. For any Yume fans out there, the game works as a psychedelic visual candy, with many dream-like environments and themes to navigate. \n\n[i]In a way, playing through this game reminded me of the first time I finished watching Spirited Away, the journey so immersive it left me in a state of melancholy. Do you ever get a feeling that you changed as a person after finishing a game? [/i]\n\n[h1] Pros: [/h1]\n\n+ fun characters, enjoyable narrative \n+ multiple endings and optional achievements \n+ creative puzzle based on memory mechanics \n+ nice variety of locations\n+ awesome soundtrack \n\n[h1] Feedback: [/h1]\n\n[u] Some Nitpicks [/u] - I ended up playing on a controller, but if you are using a mouse you have to drag the character around, it would be nice to have the clicking option instead - if it has one I don't know how to activate it. I was slightly confused by the main menu controls when using a controller, but if you can't figure out the buttons you can select the options with the mouse. I wish you just had the visual Q like \"new game\", \"load game\" and so on. Sometimes to progress you may have to talk to characters multiple times, so just make sure that you exhaust all dialogue before moving on. On a side note, you can softlock the game if the water turtle pushes you against the platform (not a big deal, reload 10 second checkpoint). Overall, I don't have any real issues with the game, mostly the story felt like sliding on a big stick of butter.  \n\n[b] Overall Thoughts: 9/10 [/b]\n\nIs it worth $20? Well, it's a really good game for this niche genre if you like those types of ambient/psychedelic games like Dreaming Sarah - it feels bigger and more ambitious than most. There is no question that devs put so much love into the project, but it's still a niche game at the end of the day. My skepticism slowly faded away as the game kept being compelling in the storytelling and enjoyable locations. As someone that plays many games that occupy the same space, I can't really imagine a game that offers much more than that. For me, it was a special game, and by 'special' I mean like it hit a nerve, got pretty personal. \n\n[code]Review By: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/31294838-Hidden-Gem-Discovery/ [/code]\n- [h1][u]Wonderful game with a great battle system, but terrible netcode[/u][/h1]\n\n[h2]Foreword[/h2]\nI got to know \"Naraka: Bladepoint\" through a friend.\nAt first I was very skeptical, so I only bought the Standard Edition, and later the Ultimate and Deluxe Editions.\nFirst of all, this game has a steep learning curve with its battles.\nExactly why the game may not be suitable for everyone.\nUnfortunately, that doesn't make the playerbase any better, but read more about that below.\nNevertheless, the game and especially the combat system offers a lot of potential and has a lot of posivites to offer.\n\n[h2]Positives[/h2]\n[list]\n[*]Regular updates with ever increasing content\n[*]Few to almost no bugs and if they are, then they are fixed very quickly\n[*]Steep learning curve - Especially at the beginning the game is not easy, but you can quickly get into it with friends\n[*]Pleasant graphics\n[*]Nice sound design, which is location dependent\n[*]Potential to grind for higher ranks and for the Hall of Fame\n[*]Different game modes and events\n[*]Extremely extensive combat system - many possibilities to conter weapons\n[*]Extensive stats, either ingame or with Naraka+ mobile app (app is absolutely top!)\n[*]Well thought through character designs\n[*]Extremely individual character editor - From Thanos to Bruce Lee everything is customizable.\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Neutral[/h2]\n[list]\n[*]Climbing system - It's really good compared to other games. However, you still sometimes get stuck on edges or can't get to the platforms above.\n[*]Microtransactions - I'm personally not a fan of them, but it's not a must in this game and doesn't favor anyone.\n[*]Answers of Discord team members very questionable on some questions\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Negatives[/h2]\n[list]\n[*]Terrible netcode - players with highpings are treated preferentially\n[*]Few European players - Extremely many VPN players with many different Asian characters and languages in the voicechat\n[*]Voicechat is not well thought through\n[*]Partial performance losses\n[*]Ranking matches are partly wrong - Either with new players (Bronze) or experienced players (Asura)\n[*]Partially bad English, as well as German translation\n[*]Some abilities are combined absolutely disgusting and unfortunately more or less meta\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Review written out[/h2]\nNaraka has become a real love-hate relationship game for me.\nI love the extensive combat system and also the steep learning curve from noob to a slightly experienced player. (I am Platinum 1 - Solar 5 at the time of this review).\nSo while the combat system could be frustrating at times at first, I love it all the more now.\nOnly the climbing system, as well as some combinations of abilities or ultimates could be revised.\nFor example, it is common practice (meta) that many players use Ultimates that stun and ensure that you immediately get into the next Ultimate.\nThis is sometimes a bit frustrating, because these combinations are played very often and other heroes, especially the new ones, are not really played because of it. \nHowever, you can work around these combinations or counter them yourself. Unfortunately, this is not always easy, especially for new players.\n(For example, the combination of Valda - Viper - Tianhai).\nHowever, a victory and the killing of opponents, especially higher ones, with whom you are unfortunately sometimes matched, releases a lot of endorphins in Naraka, so that a victory feels extremely rewarding.\n\nUnfortunately, this brings me to the part that makes it extremely difficult for me to decide on a positive rating for this game.\nThe game, for being released in 2021, has a horrible netcode for a martial arts battle royale game.\nThere are extremely many Asian players who connect directly or via VPN to the europian servers.\nThis is especially noticeable when you activate the voice chat, which by the way, has no individual regulation for volume or a mute function per player.\nUnfortunately, those players have a ping beyond 150ms.\nSadly, this is a big problem for people with low latency.\nYou partly punch through enemies bodies.\nVarious focus attacks are therefore not always blockable or the opponent lags at you, while the player for himself has no lags at all.\nThis is not only unfair, but should actually no longer be a problem in 2022.\nFor example, it would be enough to not let players with a ping greater than 150ms/200ms move.\nAccording to the Discord community manager, there is a region lock and most of the names are just \"memes\" . \nBut you don't notice anything about the region lock in the game and we can theoretically connect to other servers.\n\nAnother big problem is the matchmaking.\nEven with Bronze or Silver, you are matched with Asura players when there is a lack of players.\nThis is not necessarily nice, but you get a lot of points for survival and you also learn a lot of techniques.\n\nAs negative as this all sounds, the game still gets a positive rating from me.\nI love the sound design, which comes into its proper place in the battles and is different for each location on the map.\nThis reminds me of Prince of Persia in some areas and provides more excitement in fights.\nIn addition, the varied battles, no matter how hopeless they sometimes seem, are all the more rewarding if you win.\nEspecially when you're killing another team, consisting of 3 people, as the last survivor of your team.\nThe map design is also absolutely great. Every location has been carefully thought through. \nGreat lighting design really highlights some of the locations.\nYou can overlook small bugs like misplaced branches (a branch hangs in the air next to a tree).\n\nBut my favorite part is the grinding to a higher rank. \nThe ranking system and especially the Hall of Fame encourage you to play.\nGetting into the top 100 of a much-played character feels very rewarding.\nSo does slaying a moonbane.\n\n[h2]Epilogue[/h2]\nAll in all, despite the flaws, Naraka has a lot going for it, and even though the larger issues can be extremely frustrating, the game saves itself with the extensive battle system, the incredibly great locations including sound design, and the extensive ranking system including Hall of Fame.\nI love the game because of the thoughtful little things, even if I hate it extremely at times.\n\nEven though the game can quickly become frustrating for new players, you should be aware that it has a lot to offer if you are willing to learn.\nThe accompanying app is an extremely well thought through and great gimmick in this regard.\n\nI would be happy to take you by the hand and introduce you to the game.\nJust visit us on our [URL=https://discord.nox-eagles.de]Discord[/URL].\n\nI would like to thank all of you who have read my review until the end.\nI'm looking forward to your opinions :)\nWith best regards\nYour Holt\n- If you notice that Kagami voice sounds different, that’s because the guy who voiced him in the first game, Brad Venable, died at the beginning of last year. This time, Kagami is voiced by Austin Lee Mathews, who voiced Roche (Final Fantasy VII Remake) and Ash Carbide (Cold Steel III and IV). \n\nRest In Peace, Brad. We may forget Kaniza’s name, but we won’t forget yours. And thank you for being one of the funniest character in the game.\n- This game has such a HUGE potential like Stardew Valley in its early days!!\nCollecting stuff, helping people by crafting potions its so rewarding and lovely pls dear developers keep working on it. I BEG YOU! :D\nSure it has some bug right now but even on day one they managed to get some fast fixes and tried their best to make it work for everyone. \nThe controls were a bit tricky in the beginning (used Playstation 5 Controller) but its just a matter of time, its just not the normal controls like in other games.\nThe music was pretty nice and chill and also the animations were super cute, i love watching little Rubrum built his sandcastles over and over again. >3< \n\nOverall a good game, but could become even more better in the future, keep going guys!!\n- Definitely recommend !\nBut let's be honest here, it's early access and it fits the status of the game completely, threre are a couple of issues which would require change as soon as possible.\nHowever, the devs are incredibly responsive, they do listen to the community and as a result, the game is already much much much better than it originally was.\nA lot of work was already put into the game and a lot more is incoming.\n\nThis said, the game's title isn't too catchy and doesn't really reflect what the game really is.\n\nYou start the game by controlling manually controlling a train (you can control more than one later), the map is divided between the track of your opponent and your track.\n\nThe goal is to utterly destroy your opponent or at least survive waves.\n\nYou will need to travel around your track and dock to mines to build mining facilities, collect ores and bring them back to your HQ. There is also another spot you can use to build a specific building which will help you like radars.\n\nYou will use that ore to start research (new weapons, speed and whatnot) and upgrade your train (called an AMP) and build more defenses. Each building is protected by a force field which will make them hard to destroy and also protect you while you are docked to build, upgrade, repair or collect ores.\n\nYou can move freely on the track and control the speed of your AMP, change direction, change track direction and get a sattelite view to help you fight the enemy.\n\nBasically, fighting works as in an artillery game...\nThe map is always covered with fog of war but when an enemy or you fire, you will produce noise which will be clearly indicated on the map. This is when you will be able to use your recon ability to launch a projectile which will show you the area for a couple seconds and you can then fire.\nEach time you fire, you have to take into account the wind which can make your projectile miss, firing right now use a bowstring but it is going to disapear. Your firing range is also limited so you do have to travel near the opponent to be able to hit it.\n\nAnd that's pretty much it. The concept is quite inovative, it works pretty well and it will get a lot better in the future.\nIf you're scared to purchase the game right away becaue of the early access tag, I advise you to keep it in a corner and wait for it to evolve until the development reach a more advanced point because the game is pretty unique and quite beautiful.\nRight now controlling and managing the trains can be a bit tedious and not really easy to master but I think we can trust the devs team to find a solution to the problems.\n- Dandara is inspired by a legendary warrior who fought slavery in Brazil in the 17th Century. The similarities, however, seems to stop at the name and the fact that she is a black woman fighting a vague concept referred in the game as \"opression\". \nThe game mechanics are very unusual as you can`t really move back and forth and the art style is often charming, although sometimes it gets really generic with some enemies  inspired by Egyptian culture (I thought it was supposed to be about Brazil). The difficulty escalates quite suddenly at certain points in the game, and the fact that you have to be standing still at all times to attack your enemies is pretty frustrating. After you get used to the movement in the game, it is quite fun to jump around without the frustration of having to walk slowly through a huge map as you do in some games of the genre, especially before getting upgrades that allow you to teleport or move faster.\n The story and dialogues could also have been polished a little more. Everything is very vague making it feel a little bit like a waste of an interesting idea. Dandara is a little rough around the edges, but  pretty unique for a metroidvania style game. Worth checking out.\n- I thought I could overcome the Chinese Language barrier since I read chinese webnovels, but as it turns out trying to decipher game content is a different ballgame from novels. \nSo far, what I can make of the story is making me cringe and I can't quite figure out the combat mechanics, but I'm hoping that English translation will make it better (optimistic). Probably 5.5/10 for now and I'll revise when i get the English experience?\n- This game can be great at times but extremely frustrating most of the time. 80% change to hit, miss every time. I can't keep playing a game with so much crappy coding.\n- This game is shit, and the devs should eat shit for shitting this shit on top of gamer community's head.\nCombat? You need a piano keyboard to dodgeparryhitlowhithighlowthendodge. Its a clusterfuck! Reaction time? None. I tried to dodge, I got damaged, Parry same story. And don't get me started on fucking archery! HELLOO ITS 2021, PUT A FUCKING CROSSHAIR so I can hit something !!\n\nWow, what a piece of shit. 18 hours of my life spent TRYING to make sense of this clusterfuck of a game. Pity I can't get a refund AND throw dung at this whitewashed game, like people did to Deuscht.\n\nI hope you devs sit on it and rotate.\n\n- Wanna spend 20% of the time scared, 60% of the time confused, 15% of the time infuriated, and 5% of the time laughing your ass off? THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU!\n\nFor the rest, save your money.\n\nIt's so buggy, dark, poorly optimized, and confusing; you'll spend more time pulling your hair out than the rare moments that it actually manages to pull off a jumpscare. Also, it is NOT procedurally generated at all. Watched a YouTuber play this game and got the exact same map and jumpscares... er... \"jumpscares\" as they did. Not worth $10. If they can fix the bugs and tweak a few things, though, it'd at least be worth 5.\n\n- This is a story about relationships.\nThis is a story about opposites.\nThis is a story about reflections.\nThis is a story about redemption.\nThis is a story about damnation.\nThis is a story about reconciliation.\nThis is a story about gods.\nThis is a story about paradoxes.\nThis is a story about love.\nThis is a story about hate.\nThis is a story about life.\nThis is a story about death.\nThis is a story about forgiveness.\nThis is a story about condemnation.\nThis is a story about time and time loops.\nThis is a story about multiverse theory.\nThis is a story about murder.\nThis is a story about betrayal.\nThis is a story about trust.\nThis is a story about freedom.\nThis is a story about happiness.\nThis is a story about sadness.\nThis is a story about boredom.\nThis is a story about a Princess.\nThis is a story about what looks like a Frog at one point.\n\nThis is a story about everything and nothing.  A poem and a screed.\n\nIt begins with a simple instruction: Go kill the Princess, and a simple choice: will you kill her, will you free her, or simply walk away?  Oh, you can also decide to let her remain a prisoner; choosing to do essentially nothing is still a choice.\n\nIt ends with a question: who is she?  Also, who are you?  More importantly, what are you to one another?\n\nThis review also ends with a question: \"Should you buy this game?\" and an answer: \"Hell yes, you should!\"\n- Overwhelmingly positive. pfft come on!\nThis game is walking and a puzzle simulator. Everything damn thing in this game is missing. \nThis game is not even a shooter, can almost pass by every damn zombie.\nAll you have to do is run and solve puzzles.\nBeen solving puzzles for 13 hours. Barely got time to shoot anything.\n- This is probably one of the best \"battlefield\" type games out there, i was super disapointed at these days battlefields and want it to go back to those good ol'days battlefields. I got this and some more, amazing maps except from some. I still think the game is amazing, but no game is perfect due to the poor progression system... But they are addressing this with updates to fix this, which is amazing.\n- While the game isn't on standard with the new Warhammer games, it does feature a very interesting time period. Sadly though, I cannot recommend this game in its current state. The game wasn't perfect, sure. But over recent time they have added elements that will disrupt your experience, if you are looking for a somewhat realistic and immersive Total War. PM me if you need a further explanation.  \n\nI'd buy it for 3 to 5 dollars when it goes on sale - then I would say it was passable and good for some hours fun until my previous points kick in.\n- While i'm not far into it, so far it is great. All negative reviews are due to the stuttering. I have a 3070 and I googled a solution.\n\nWIth Nvidia GPUs go to Nvidia control panel and change the global shader cache size in 3d settings to unlimited. Also limit the fps of Elden Ring, I have it set to 60 fps. So far no problems on my end. Hope this helps somebody choosing to get the game.\nIf u have AMD GPUs I don't know specifics so please ask google sorry for not being able to help, but I know it is a similar process.\n\nNow 30hrs in the game is so good too\n\nNow done with the game it is amazing\n- Stellaris is the contemporary 4X sci fi galactic empire grand strategy to play.  The spiritual successor to ancient space exploration games like Master of Orion and Star Wars: Rebellion.  Start out with just your homeworld and send out scout ships and colonies until you've got your own star empire. \n\nManage your population, tell them what to build, design your own spaceships and fleet structures, and then get pounded into the dirt by the far too cheaty AI... yeah, it's another one of those games where because it's hard to make the AI smart, Paradox decided instead to just make the AI units cheat and become ridiculously overpowered.\n\nI have to say the game is probably far too difficult even if you set all the difficulty to the easiest levels, it's unclear what the developers were thinking, but you can mod the game easily in Steam Workshop to make it viable to play single player. \n\nAs with all Paradox games the DLC pricing is murder, and it adds very little to the core game experience, so my advice is to grab this on sale if you were a fan of MOO, go straight to Steam Workshop and mod it until it's playable, and then you'll have a perfect time sink well worth your money.\n- After playing thousands of games both singleplayer and multiplayer, unlocking all achievements and getting every solo map medal, I think it's time for a review:\n\nIf you like tower defence games: I recommend.\nIf you like any previous Bloons games: I recommend.\nIf you want something casual and chill: I recommend.\nIf you want a bit of a challenge: I recommend.\n\nThe tower type variety is interesting and diverse, with 5 tiers of upgrades each (plus special \"paragon\" towers)\nThe game devs have been providing free updates for years.\nThere's lots of achievements and medals to get.\nThere's online co-op, boss events and even different game-modes.\n\nThe game is more expensive than it used to be, but literally any sale price makes it worth a buy!\n- Bullet hell? Check.\nAwesome animations? Check.\nBoss fights? Check.\nSongs from favorite artists? Check.\nParty mode? Check.\nMultiplayer/online mode? Check.\nBest physics? Check.\nOk that list is good... for now\n- A Visual Novel meets The Stanley Parable by way of Disco Elysium. This game contains a shocking amount of depth of content and thematics behind it's excellent voice acting and 3-colour sketchy visual style. Well worth a play if you're intrigued.\n- What should i say, the dream has come true.\nKept us waiting, huh.\n\n---\nOLD REVIEW JUST FOR DOCUMENTATION\n\nif you're new, here's your list of the main games\n\nmetal gear (msx)\nmetal gear 2 (msx)\nmetal gear solid (ps1)\nmetal gear solid 2 sons of liberty (ps2)*\nmetal gear solid 3 snake eater (ps2)*\nmetal gear solid 4 guns of the patriots (ps3)\nmetal gear rising: revengeance (pc)\nmetal gear solid peace walker hd (ps3)\nmetal gear solid v ground zeroes (pc)\nmetal gear solid v the phantom pain (pc)\n\n*: mgs2 and mgs3 have a ps3/x360 HD ver.\n*: there is also mgs2: substance and mgs3: subsistence which are expanded editions: the former has bonus VR missions, snake tales, skateboarding and extras. and the latter includes extra content + metal gear 1 and 2.\n\nthank you for all the mem(es)ories kojima san!\n- The Witch's House has been my most favorite RPG Maker horror game for years and now I have the remaster which I can buy to directly support the developer. Needless to say how good it is so I will only talk about what is changed and what still remains.\nThe game is still suspenseful and very atmospheric. Some people may worry that the updated graphic and engine may take that away but trust me it is still there and not going anywhere.\nSome sound effects/dialogues have been changed beside the graphic which I am not against it at all. Still very like the remaster.\nThe control is still the same which is as clunky as before when you are not used to. I think the developers know that and decided to not change it so I won't complain. Just say it out for you to know because the game is very old so the control is still there in the past with many other RPG maker games.\nI very like the new graphic and I think they deserve much more compliments for this. However, I like the weird-big-eye Viola model and her less hair skinny portrait more. It look weird and funny at the same time. The new model makes her more beautiful but the portrait makes her kinda fat (at least to me).\nThe new hard mode is.... hard that all I can say without spoiler.\nI don't know whether or not I should calll this a remake but at least it is done better than DSR. And Small indie developers should be supported more. May be \"Ib\" will be remastered some days too if this game is success\nThump Up!\n- [I received this product for free from a giveaway]. Only played for a short time, but sheesh, it's a bit of a mess both visually and gameplay wise. There's not much I can really say that would differ from what's shown in the trailer (rather crude MS-paint looking drawings with a few short looping backgrounds). You jump when moving right or left, flappy-bird esque, you dodge stuff going across the screen and from the top, which is a bit boring to me, but some may enjoy it more. You also have to go out of the screen to dodge sometimes, but also if you go too far out (who knows how far) you'll die as well. It might be an okay time waster for free (like old flash games), but I wouldn't recommend spending your money on this.\n- GIVE ME THE GODDAMN COPY/PASTE ROOM BUTTON!\n\n10/10 would play again.\n\n(Ttips to combat the somewhat broken system atm:\n\n1. Use patients list, manually send those patients to treatment or home: \na. Very high diagnosis but still queuing for GPs (even 100% patients will wait for GP till their death, it will waste most GP resources)\nb. Very low mood/health patient, if you can gurantee the patient getting their treatment soon w/o affecting others in the queue, use the room's queue function, or use click on the patient to change his position in the queue, otherwise send him home to avoid penalty\n\n2. Treatments are much more profitable than diagnosis, plus they leave after treatment no matter what, but if well treated, then you don't need much ghost hunting janitors\n\n3. If in need of money in the early game, don't bother with food/drink/bathroom/comfort, do the minium and focus on your diagnosis -> treatment, most patient will get treated before they rage quit, thus make you a lot of money. With staff, if they near rage quit, just raise their salary.\n\n4. In the early game, only put down the essential objects (e.g. only desk and file cabinet in GP's) to maximize your profit. They only room I recommend to decorate to lvl 5 is staff room to speed up their recovery.\n\n5. ALWAYS ensure there is a toilet right next to your staff room, and a cafe. If a tired staff need bathroom, he/she will walk all the way to the staff room and back to toilet and back to staff room, even if a toilet is right next to his/her office. Samething with Cafe, it provides a 'nice meal' bonus.\n\n6. Do not build more reception than you need, build less. It is a great way to control the patient flow, they don't wonder around while in a reception queue.\n\n7. For a large map, patients entering the hospital from mutiple gates. I don't recommend building reception other than one specific area (preferably right next to GP's office), reason as above.\n\n8. News agent can get long queue very easily, as long as you have one, patients in queue will travel all the way across the map for it. So be careful, either don't put any, or put one in every building (at least).\n\n9. With spare money, get your staff trained ASAP, especially staff providing treatment (to ensure high chance of successful treatment)\n\n10. Click on a room, goes to 'info' tab, the last sentence there will tell you what training the staff in the room should have.\n\n11. Keep track of your staff's skills, and assign them only ONE job in the staff -> job assignment menu, so AI won't mess your system up.)\n\nThings I'd really like to be changed:\n1. WAY too many patients.\nI think the new patients' growth(spawn) need to be slow down at certain point either automatically or mannually, I often found myself in need of double the amount of GP offices in the mid-game. Since GP offices are the choke points, it can get out of control in matter of seconds, which left no Human resources/money/time to train everyone. Besides, it is realistic, there are only so many people a town have.\nAnd because of the growth issue, I find myself have to build more and more, I'd like to slow down and taking care of every corner of my hospital, not just keep building. Quality takes time, nobody like be overly pushed by the game.\n\n2. Rooms merge\nJust like in real lives, Doctor's room are private, but pharmacy? I think other rooms should not be private - Allow us to put multiple machine and people in one room, make it shared. It is just bizzare to not make it shared, and vey wasteful of time/money/spaces. Besides, some room looks really empty.\n\n3. Wards\nWards are weird, I'm not sure why. Often than not, I have more than enough beds and nurses, but still 6+ wait outside, I'm not sure what triggers them to be 'called in'\n\n4. FOOD/DRINK/TOILET is broken\nI'm sorry, but I'm not gonna build cafe & bathroom every 3 inchs. IRL, most hospital have 1~3 cafes, a small~medium toilet on every floor. Space is valuable, I would rather leave it to medical facilities. I think the AI is a bit broken at this point, they constantly want drink/food/bathrooms while I have 6+ machines/2 toilets in every building. As if they can't walk 10m to the nearest one.\n\n5. Janitors are kind of dump.....I wish we can assign areas to janitors/assitances, so they won't always walk across the map back and forth.\n\n6. Man, this is 2018, we got central heating and air-conditioning...for real. Maybe make a seprate tunnel system? Like water, electricity, heat, air. Hospital's air exchange system is much more important than usual buildings I believe.\n\n7. Credit to Ibbi Wyxx in the commnet, I think it is great to set patient with certain percent of diagnosis straight to treatment rooms. It makes sense and later in the game, with doctors fully trained I imagine 100% diagnosis on most patients in the GP's shouldn't be a problem. And it is how real life works as well, dorctors are not always 100% sure whats wrong, they might start some harmless/urgent treatment first, myself actually is in this situation right now \n\n(sometimes I feel like I'm being treated in my own hospital because I just stayed at one IRL, so I have to make everything right as if trying to please myself...)\n\n8.  Some of those skills just look fancy since you can't replace them.\nThis one does not matter much, I'm very OCD when it comes to managment, so atm I have to wait for the right person w/o any skills I don't want on them so the training oppourtinity will not go wasted, but it is hard and annoying. Besides, it is a real problem since you can only learn 5 skills, so just choosing whoever is not effective and effecient in the long run. (for example a GP w/ Radiology skill)\n\nAlso, it makes some of the skill essentially useless, i.e. master class (speed up learning and teaching), it may seem useful, but it will eventually cost you a lot more than you gain. Down the line it will cost you one spot for other skill. If just hiring someone w/ this skill to teach then fire him, it is also costly and not making any real sense. \n\nThings I'd like to see (in DLCs?):\n1. Ambulances management. Ambulance are essential part of a hospital, ERs are even better! (Stayed at a ER bed not long ago watch the whole ER room working,man, ERs are cool af, but I do hope less people need to see it because it is...ER)\n2. Multifloor-hospital.\n3. ICU etc.?\n4. Medicin/drug development/management\n5. Specialists office?\n6. More background music/radio, its a bit repetitive at this point\n- cool game but the font is almost unreadable at times\n- Falcom's Action RPG Masterpiece.\n\nbest story in the series. it follows the latest adventure of Adol and his companions, stranded in an island and slowly uncovering their secrets. the tight, but well developed cast are absolutely the best written characters in the series. from party member to your fellow castaways all have developed motivation, personality and charm. \n\nalot of the horribad translation and voice acting have been fixed, and it finally got the treatment it deserve as a masterpiece. \n\nthe gameplay is an evolution of the modern Ys game. at its core, ys 8 is an action RPG where you control adol and several other party members with unique set of skills, moveset, weapons and super attack. each character represent an attack type (slash, pierce, smash) that are pitted against various enemies with certain weaknesses. great variety of enemies, amazing boss battles, music and story. \n\non release, there seems to be a big problem for the port, but as far as i know, everything has been patched to very good level of stability. over 70 hours, the game crashed twice (and saved by the intuitive autosave system), run flawlessly 60 FPS and 1440p without a single slowdown. \n\n10/10 game go buy so we get monstrum nox on PC.\n- It's hard to review a game like this.\n\nAs a game in it's own right, if you've never played it before, it's a good game. Typical crazy Final Fantasy story (although it takes a bit to get into it), interesting characters, and simple but fun real-time turn-based combat. Final Fantasy games are known for their stories and characters, which are great in this member of the series.\n\nIf you've played the game before on PS1, then it's good for nostalgia. However, many people complain about it being a bad port. It has built-in cheats, in case you just want to be able to enjoy the story, characters, and side-quests. I played this years ago on PS1, and I really enjoyed my trip down memory lane with this game.\n\nIf you're an achievement hunter, this game is horrible. There are achievements that, unless you're literally following an online scripted step-by-step walkthrough, you will miss some random little thing, not know it, and then have to play the entire game over. Another achievement requires you to speed through the game in under 12 hours, which means you will grind through the game you already played, watching the same story you just watched, all over again, wasting six hours (that's how long it took me), just for the sake of one achievement... There's also another achievement to kill 10k enemies. when you can play the whole game and not even kill 1k enemies... You might think, \"oh they just want you to play the game through 10 times then\". No. It's 10k enemies in one playthrough. You run out of content, and have nothing to do, except grind battles, for literally dozens of hours. It's terrible.\n\nDespite my bitterness about the achievements, it's a really enjoyable game. Considering the FF series are mainly known for their stories, it lives up to its reputation. If you're an RPG fan, this is definitely on the list of \"must plays\".\n- Beautifully drawn and atmospheric\n\nAmazing sound\n\nSimple to play yet gives just the right amount of challenge without being frustrating\n\nI played and finished it in one sitting, Mainly because I was riveted from start to finish\nYes its 3-4 hours long but you will enjoy every minute of it\nI don't think I will ever understand whats going on with the story...but somehow I think that was the intention\n\nHighly recommended and definitely best indie game of the year, perhaps the last 5 years\n- Don't buy the last fifa I own is fifa 19 and it did not improve I played 2 fut matches 1 was so laggy it was unplayable the second was doable and I won after strugling big time but i got a DNF penalty because ea servers were overloaded. Seriously wtf ea? How did you not manage to improve anything over 3 years? Also why my game disconnects everytime I write to a friend or change my music it was also in fifa 19 i don't get it.\n- i don't think i liked it :(\n\na richly illustrated nightmare fairy tale which warns of paranoid infighting and reaching for an unattainable ideal, broken apart by tedious and artificially difficult survival horror segments. i meet each hazard as intended and am often punished with unforgiving damage or by being taken to an instant game over, and while i fully accept that this very well might just be a skill issue on my part, it remains a significant hurdle that's barring me from engaging properly with the unfolding narrative.\n\ni'm not unfamiliar with the death-laden rpgmaker horror-esque titles which preceded LGTS and those it draws its inspirations from, its how it contextualises such flaws that becomes an issue. there are no \"skip seen dialogue\" options, with the fast forward made available to us after Elise's delayed inputs just slow enough to be annoying. on that note, bosses with instant death attacks have unskippable cutscenes prior making repeat attempts patronising. two core survival systems are made redundant within one of the in-game days. perhaps most tragically, the distinct visual style which once pleased the eye beings to blend into monotony and goes unappreciated after some hours.\n\nand like i'm sad about it! i wanted to like it! i really enjoyed how the story progressed and how my bond with my favourite lady bloomed and i liked the endings i've managed to get, but all these hiccups had me nearly just uninstalling early. it's a beautiful poetic horror title, but so many little things simply ended up overwhelming me.\n- Basically Wizard of Legend, but from a different viewpoint. Same composer, both pixel art, similarly fast paced boss fights with good telegraphs, combos are a little less deliberate, though. Very satisfying build making, with solid build variety. Has couch co-op which is very nice. It has some beautiful pixel art, truly. This game is a feast for the eyes and ears with cutscenes, voice acting, and more. Ok, I just love this game. It's so damn good.\n- Do you like Super Metroid? if you do, just play this game. \nThis game has a lot of exploration, a lot of colectables and weapons, a big world filled with secrets, a very interesting story, a lot of cool abilities and a very cool artstyle.\nThis days the tag \"metroidvania\" is on almost half of all the indie games I see on steam. But I  can honestly say, that this one is one of the few (if not the only one) that truly deserves that tag.\nIt gives you the feel of those 2d metroid and castlevania games, but with a lot of little tweaks that brings that play style to the new era of gamming.\nTo make this whole thing even more amazing, this game was made by just one man. And the love this guy put on this game is amazing, you can really feel it and it's speacially clear when you look at all the atention every little detail of this game had. Also the dev is very active on the forum, and will help you out with any technical issue you're having.\n\nAmazing art, amazing gameplay and a lot of replayability. You can't go wrong with this game.\n- The EOS stands for End of Service. I am sure someone has fun with this or there wouldn't be a reason to keep bringing it back. Right? The usual Tab Target MMO. I do like that you can teleport to quest givers and mobs instead of the usual auto or manual run. Aside from that there isn't anything modern here.\n- Game is super realistic, got ahead of Hamilton and he pitted me into a wall going 180mph, just like real life!\n- A criminally underrated game, I have seldom seen a developer take their original hit which was already almost perfect, and actually manage to improve on it in every way shape and form. You do not need to have played the original to play or enjoy this game. Their stories are completely seperate.\n\nThe game itself is much less linear than its predecessor. The best way I can explain the feeling of going through the environments without referencing Grimrock itself is by saying it felt an awful lot like Myst to me, just with combat. Required puzzles for progression were challenging but not impossible, some of the secret challenges were much more difficult. I admit I used an online guide more than a few times, but it did nothing to diminish my enjoyment of the game. It is immersive, challenging, and satisfying. \n\nThe only drawback I can think of is the difficulty. It feels like you cannot win with any group composition, I suggest no more than 2 of any class or weapon/armor type user. I went with a warrior, two rogues(one range), and a mage, this way you as well makes you unlikely to complete a difficult fight or puzzle and be rewarded with something you cannot use. Combat itself can be challenging as I said, but you will rarely feel like you are simply incapable of winning. There are obvious ways to optimize the way you approach an encounter the second time if you die the first.\n\nBe prepared to immerse yourself, you must pay attention to your surroundings, read and remember notes you find, explore every nook and cranny you can find, and you will be rewarded. Good luck!\n\n- bad doesnt fit a 1080p monitor u bastard.  ported straight over from mobile. boring. fuck off\n- So, I've been playing games for 36 year now. All the genres, like them all. Most of all RPG, turn based strategies, WW2 shooters (BF) etc. And just achieved victory in Slay the spire, after 206 hours of hugely enjoyable play. I would say this is in top 5 games of all times for me. Maybe even top 2, together with Card Hunter. Those two games are so far the two games I would take to a deserted island. I am actually seriously considering making my own card based game in the future. So just try this. Even my 10 year old son loves it. I just recorded The Slaying for him xD\n- please stop resetting my setting\n- [h1] Too much for too little? [/h1]\nThe game hovers over/under an hour (depending on your pace) and there really isn't much in terms of replayability....besides going through it again or trying to obtain all the achievements (which aren't challenging), this at most would add a couple more hours.So in short you don't get much content for the price tag, with that said what you do get is quality.... a lot of it, ranging from the art to the music and everything in between. Now with that in mind, I believe that if the lack of content hinders you too much wait for a sale, but if not go ahead and pick it up you probably won't regret it. \n[h1] What's inside? [/h1]\nStory is very straightforward without much depth behind it, but that's not necessarly a bad thing... at least when it comes to this game. What makes an otherwise simple plot into something much more enticing is how everything like the art style, music, flow from one scene to the next and especially the interactions complement one another in order to create a sense of immersion w/everything that comes with that feeling. \n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\nI highly recommend this game for anyone with feeeels and without. It's short, but as they say it \"packs a punch\".\n- I appreciate the sincerity of Jusant. You can tell its creators have placed genuine care into their product, which has made the experience of playing it joyful and kind.\nThe visuals are stunning, the mechanics are not overwhelming, the soundtrack is soothing, and the puzzles are not frustrating. A great climbing game all around with an easy-to-follow yet gripping narrative. \nHopefully, Ukrainian localization will also be added soon.\n\n- Only one word to describe this game\n\nOutdated.\n\nThere is no real point to get this game unless you want a slightly better looking UI and atmosphere. L4D2 already contains the campaigns from L4D1 and is where the entire Left 4 Dead community is. Only a small playerbase still plays l4d1, mostly out of nostalgia. But there is quite literally no reason to get the game.\n\nYou can grab it if you are into achievements, but only do so when it goes on sale, i grabbed it for a couple penny, still a bad idea.\n- Overall its a great hunting game. The base game is good enough on its own to give you an enjoyable experience hunting several varieties of animals. \n\nI feel that some of the best content is in the DLC's. I dont mind the price tag for maps are they are just a large and some of them have a truly diverse animal population. \n\nThe Weapon Packs have some items that really should have been available in the base game (.22 rifle).\nTripod stands, Tents and ATV's are also DLC items that i feel should have been included in the base game. \n\nThe cost for these packs are not huge, and I have bought them, but they really do impact your play in a meaningful way so it is hard not feel like they were left out on purpose. \n\nBeing a former hunter in real life I would say that the realism of it is pretty good. Lung shots and heart shots drop animals quickly and using the right ammo along with good aim greatly influences this. A poor shot will leave you tracking this wounded animal across the map till you sneak up on it again or just give up. \n\nThey have a system called Tru Racks (sumthn like that) that simulates different qualities of animals. So you end up with little bucks, average bucks, and monster bucks. Weight and coloration plays a part in this too. In short every animal has a trophy of some kind and they are varied by what must be some sort of RNG. \n\nAll that having been said, this game can devolve into a shooting gallery were you kill everything on sight as there in no real incentive not to. You get money and experience for every kill you claim and wiping out a heard of deer with your DLC M1 Garand on your DLC Tripod Stand becomes the quickest way to bypass the grind.\n\n It feels like the game starts as a \"hunting sim\" and becomes a \"poaching sim\" once you realize the progression system is going to take a long time to do...\"ethically?\".\n\n\nAgain, this is a game i would recommend, but it is just that, a game. \n\n\n- I hated Undertale.\n\nIt was, pretty clearly, a game about sexy skeletons. I did not care about sexy skeletons. I refused to play a game about sexy skeletons.\n\nThen my friend made me listen to the soundtrack, and I decided I could deal with a few hours of sexy skeletons if I got to listen to the best video game music I had ever heard while doing it. \n\nI played Undertale. It's not a game about sexy skeletons. It's a game about choices, maybe, or morality, or curiosity. It's a game about pushing the limits. It's a game about experiences, about \"what would happen if I did this?\", about storytelling so intricate and complex and raw that it shouldn't be able to fit into seven hours of bullet hell and pixel graphics. But, somehow, it does. Every choice you make has an impact. Every object you check has a story. The soundtrack, the witty yet profound writing, the simple pixel graphics, and even the menu screens and bullet patterns themselves all intertwine in order to tell a story that only you decide the ending of.\n\nAlso, the skeletons aren't even sexy.\n\nMy advice to you: Go in as blind as you can. Don't read walkthroughs. Don't watch playthroughs. Don't prepare yourself. Don't even look at overviews. Hell, don't even read the Steam page description. Just buy the game (and give some well-earned money to a little white dog), and, as it were, climb the mountain yourself. Don't let anyone backseat. Don't listen to people who tell you there's a right way to play.\n\nAnd when you think you've reached the end, just think--what other choices could you have made?\n\nSo, yes. I hated Undertale.\n\nAnd then I played it.\n- I am a Filthy Casual (tm) who plays games like Mass Effect and Fallout 4 on easy and still die over and over. I got my \"you died\" achievement in Dark Souls 2 before the tutorial and stopped playing after like forty minutes with zero qualms. I have rage quit every single platformer game I have ever touched, and just sort of despise brutally hard things that feel like chores.\n\nBasically, I am not exactly sure why I decided to buy Dead Cells in the first place. Sure, I love the look and one of the few platformers I've ever 100%'d was Super Metroid (with a LOT of swearing and rage quitting), so 'Metroidvania' is an appealing term to me, but it is still inherently marketed as a game that is not for me, or people like me.\n\nThis game is hard. I have 11 hours on it and I can't get past the third area on any given path. I die for stupid reasons and lose all my stuff and... I don't care. I haven't rage quit once; in fact, I have to force myself away from the game after a death so I can do things like eat. I find the combat engaging and entertaining, the progression satisfying and there's something really solid about being forced to start from square one (ish) every single time, in a way I've just never experienced.\n\nSo, sure, buy this if you love hard games/Dark Souls/no checkpoint kind of games. Absolutely, I'm pretty sure you've alreeady heard this is likely to be up your alley.\n\nBut even if you're a dirty rotten casual gamer who button smashes in any game approaching action, and panics when the screen flashes red around the edges... give it a try if you get the opportunity. It is seriously fun.\n- Steam, for gods sake, give us a neutral recommendation button.\n\nSooo, long story short, the game is nice and has beautifull artwork. It´s also massivly too short. This are the only objective things I can say about it. \n\nNow to be a bit more real here. I bought this game, because I played another game like this, let´s call it \"Blue Sticks Bar\". And that game hooked me into this genre.\nNormally I´m someone who likes extensive interaction with a Games Story more than anything else. For this reason I hated TTG and similar stuff. But that Barkeeping game had such a complex Story and such good Characters that I fell in love with it and by extension the Genre.\n\nSo I got myself Coffee Talk. And boy oh boy let me tell ya, I´m seriously torn with this game. Partway through I thought I would give it a searing bad review. But then I played through it and noticed something. This game isn´t bad, just painfully average. And, I hate to say this, but I´m probably too mature for it.\n\nNow don´t get me wrong.\nSome things here are just wonderfull. The Artstyle? Fantastic (exept for a couple minor things)\nI´m guessing the music is also good if you like it.\n\nBut already there are cracks there. Something (mildly) dramatic is happening and some coffee house tunes are playing in the Background. It´s honestly just laughable.\nAnd that word is a great segway into talking about the Story. You know that moment when you´re browsing and find (mostly on Tumblr) some really cute little story idea? This is that the game. Problem is, that a Story that deals with, for example racism, growing up, PTSD and some other really serious matters can´t be as shallow as this.\n\nYou have to decide. Either you´re doing Babies first social awareness Storyline and leave out some of this stuff, OR you do a real mature story that I can´t sum up in one single sentence.\n\nI really want to like this Game. I´m a lonely little Geek, so a Story about interesting People in a Shadowrun-light Setting sounded right up my alley. But it was simply too dissappointing. \n\nI wouldn´t refund this game even if I could, since it had some good stuff in it. \nBut sadly I can´t recommend it.\n\n\nWow, I got through this all without swearing, nice one!\n- Let's say you capture a prisoner after a bloody raid on your colony. Do you want to:\n\n1. Let them go in the hopes of improving relations with the attackers? YOU CAN DO THAT.\n\n2. Heal them and have colonists talk to them about how great your colony is until they join? YOU CAN DO THAT.\n\n3. Have a colonist with a high medical skill remove their liver to transplant into an alcoholic colonist? YOU CAN DO THAT.\n\n4. Have a colonist with a low medical skill remove their organs just for practice? YOU CAN DO THAT.\n\n5. Eat them because you forgot to stock up on food for the winter? YOU CAN DO THAT.\n\nReally, what else do you need in a game?\n- It's an asset flip. I know that's a bit obvious, but just in case you were in doubt, there you go.\n\nFull of bugs, rushed, empty, poor sound/animation/ai/overall design quality, completely broken english, barely functioning UI, you get the picture, it's a cash grab.\n- Fall Guys had a rough start. Unstable servers and people cheating to win. About a year later I picked it up again and I must say it really has improved a lot. I honestly don't have any issues which cheaters anymore and the servers don't crash on me anymore.\n\nIt's also getting more and more stages to play so it feels refreshing to play a few rounds every day.  The events for certain skins are also really fun. Sure there could still be some improvements like personal usernames or maybe a way to trade in skins you don't want. But I feel like they listen to their community and are aiming to make it as fun as possible. I'm interested to see how Fall Guys will keep evolving!\n- I purposefully went into this game looking for bugs, seeing that it was in early access, and I have yet to find any. The only reason I stopped playing was because there was a fence that wasn't fully secured to the ground that I was able to get underneath, allowing me to get out of bounds. This lead to me falling into an area where I couldn't get out, and it wouldn't let me respawn at my most recent checkpoint. This would mean I'd have to start from the beginning, which I very much didn't want to do. Anyway, the biggest tips I can give to the developers is to make sure the map is 100% how they want it, and to make the audio design better. That's it. I may come back and change my review in the future.\n\nFINAL RATING: 4 / 10\n- This game is adrenaline, speed and acid to the absolute maximum and it delivers - you'll be doing exactly what you see in the trailers in absolutely no time and feeling like a badass!\n\nWe have all the menu, leaderboards and replay system as in Devil Daggers along with a new clips section for highlights from runs. \nThe new scoring system is a HUGE improvement. In DD you had to survive as long as possible leading to it becoming repetitive as you grinded, here the score is based on how fast you can kill stuff and there is an ending to the run meaning you might survive to the end and kill the boss - but someone else could beat your score by killing stuff faster in the first min and then dying. \nThis adds loads more risk to the game as you WANT to take those risks to kill stuff faster.\n\nOnly let down is the controls, the simple control scheme worked in Devil daggers as there wasn't much going on but it REALLY hurts now theres so many new mechanics causing both a lot of unintended actions like with RMB is your laser and you can scatter this off the ground or like you see in the trailers shoot the gems for your homing daggers trouble is RMB is also grab meaning if you look at a gem and start to power your laser you simple pick up the gem and no laser huge momentum loss. Likewise spacebar is jump, dash, slide, fake and air slam this not only leads to awkward \"thats not what i wanted\" moments but also cramps my hand since you are constantly spamming for dash which is 2 presses...\n\nIf the controls dont bother you or get some love this game is easily a 10/10.\n- cool game but the font is almost unreadable at times\n- Everything apart from the matches is superb, best FM ever. \n\nThe match engine is fundamentally broken - too easy to split a defence open with a long ball resulting in a one-on-one, so SI nerfed the conversion rates of one-on-one chances to keep scorelines acceptable. The result however, is that your world class  striker misses 2-5 easy chances every game. \n\nWingers do not square the ball for strikers, instead preferring to shoot from obscenely acute angles rather than play the ball across the box. \n\nHalf the crowd is a repeated man in an orange jumper. This may sound minor but it's really immersion breaking once you notice it. You can be a team that plays in blue, and yet over 50% of the crowd are dressed in orange. It diminishes the match experience and detracts from the game as a whole.\n\nIt's crap like this, broken for 2 months now, I've bought every game in this series since the year 2000, I pre-order every year (literally the only game I will do so with) and said I'll continue to do so until I get burned. Well, SI Games, you've broken me at last. The 'Bugs' section of your forum is littered with these issues that are \"under review\", well you can consider my purchase of FM 2021 in the same category.\n\nEdit: I played a bunch more because apparently I'm a masochist. The match engine is total cack and has regressed massively since FM 2017. Don't waste your money - take up a more enjoyable pastime such as jamming needles in your eyes, you'll thank me for it.\n- An Excelent, well polished shmup(except for one technical fault) with great graphics and music.\n\nNot much to say other than it has fun boss fights with some creative bullet patterns, you have a gauge that fills up and when activated it doubles your fire power, and also you have bombs. If you have bombs and you get hit, you lose all of your bombs instead of just dying straight out, so you essentially have 2 hit points. You have a graze meter as well, meaning that if bullets pass by you it fills that meter up, when it is full, all bullets around you are basically nullified, and any enemy you kill, any bullets it fired at you will also get nullified. When you pass through the nullifeid bullets, it will fill the first gauge I mentioned so you can go ape s**t more often.\n\nIt's fairly simple, but the pace of the game takes a little while to get used to, the speed of your ship releative to the bullets is a little too slow but it's not game breaking. The only major issue is that my controller is not detectable by the game so I have to use joytokey, so I can't make full use of my controllers analog controls.\n- So, I hated this game at first...\n\n I've never been into a MMO before, and I went into it with a mindset of \"FUCK YEAH! MULTIPLAYER SKYRIM LETS GO\" - In short don't do that. This isn't going to be like playing Skyrim, Oblivion, Morrowind. \n\nIt is when it all comes down to the core an MMO, it's set in Tamriel, it sounds like Tamriel and the storylines feel like an Elder Scrolls game. However being an MMO, it has a lot of grindy MMO style quests. And don't get me wrong, it's bewildering at first, all these mechanics, all these places to go....and before the 'One Tamriel' update if you chose the wrong faction, you were screwed, in a place all on your own surrounded by all these people who are WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY higher level than you. But thankfully they changed all of that. The game scales now, so you can rock up to a dungeon with your level V300 mate, and still have some fun slicing up enemies.\n\nSo I saw a friend playing the other day, and spent a few hours installing this to join him (By the way its like 70 Gig...If you have slow internet prepare for a few days of download), I got back on it after not playing for 14 months, but this time I was playing with a friend who was already Veteran Level 250, So I was in luck, he introduced me to everything and I got used to all the deconstructing of equipment to get my blacksmithing up, showed me about dungeons and bascially got me to enjoy the grind. I think my previous time was a bit lackluster because I got dropped in the middle of the Aldmeri Dominion on my own, without any of my friends. So I left.\n\nNow I know what I'm doing, and keep in mind I usually hate MMO's never played WoW or anything like that, this is the first one. I'm enjoying myself, I'm triple digits into this game time-wise and I don't see it stopping now. We've made a guild for noobies. To help them out, and get them to enjoy the game also. Because the community is nice...but you still get the elitist fucks from any competitive game kicking you out of dungeons because you're only level 14. But you won't get that when you're in a guild, having people to play with and explain all the mechanics did help, a lot. I've even gone as far as to buy this AGAIN on steam just to collect my hours and so on.\n\nAdd-ons are awesome being able to mod basic features of the game to help with information and quality of life improvements is a must. I'll provide an essential mods pack if any of you wish to know.\n\nFor those of you who actually got this far into this, well done. I didn't think I'd keep you captivated long enough to get to the end.\n\nIf any of you are new to the game, on EU server and would like to join a guild to show you the way, add me or visit our [url=www.godsofsalt.com]website[/url] and join us on teamspeak, or just message us in game @diseasedcrow.\n\nBut all in all if you like Elder Scrolls and you think you want to try this, just do, I'm glad I gave it a second chance.\n- Not really that great of a game. It's fairly unengaging, very slow paced, impossible boss fights just a few hours in. Unless you like games that requre hours of picking plants to craft potions you rub on your sword to give you 3 minutes of attack boost to be able to do any damage, side quest grinding, boring activites, and the general RPG stat grinding, skip this one and just get the Witcher 3 which is a game magnitudes better. CD Projeck Red really made the Witcher and Withcer 2 for the hardcore RPG fans. The experience just isn't worth the time investment on this one in my opinion. Not going to finish it and just go enjoy the third game instead.\n\nEDIT: \nTR;DR: A mediocre hack-n-slash that has been dummed down from the predeccesor for consoles.\n- First thing you see when the game loads is \"You have to buy the game to blahblah\", as i didn't know there was a paid version, i felt betrayed. Anyway,\nSorry, i tried it, not expecting much, but there was not much from it..\n-Graphics are bad\n-Movement and animation are clunky, same with attacking\n-Zombie AI would hit you even if you walked backwards 2 seconds ago\n-Regions are EU and NA, multiple servers each with a PVE server, but it was so empty.\n-Gameplay-wise.... so many questions like, \"Why do i need to hold E for 5 seconds to open a fridge?\", \"Why does headshot being counted but it doesnt insta-kill a basic zombie?\", \"Why does the soldier npc's look like they are making money from you?\", and lasty \"What the heck is the goal of this game?\"\n-Oh and driving vehicles SUCK! *ehem*\n\nSorry NOPE\n- I bought this piece of shit with 50 other games.\nIt is as if some great sculptor , sculpted out of a great feculence.\nI do honestly admire your efforts. If such a dung was made in the 90s\nI am sure it would have succeeded to a most part very very small percent of \npeople would have been tricked into purchasing this. I had to leave it running for\n2 more minutes just to warn you about this defecation.\n\nI insist not to play this as it literally is breaking your steam game playing aparatus.\nI am not sure how this technical disgrace got passed steam as it literally damages your\nequipment steam could have green lit any of the other great games out there or taken a deuce OR both du duns, Whoever made this did not try to fix any of it's many flaws. They just said\nthis magnificent excrement is done and as many secretious BM it runs on steam. 0/10\n- Okami is the best non-Zelda Zelda game, but also best dog simulator.\n\n10/10 Dog features include:\n\nYou can bark at people for no reason! You can dig up bones! You can catch a birb in your mouth and then prance! You can bite people in the crotch and they are like \"hey! what! why i oughta!\" If you see a demon, you can pee on it!\n\n\nPlease purchase The Legend of Dog Zelda for a good time.\n- [h1] Brief summary of why the Chinese players are so pissed: [/h1]\n\nThe reason for the chinese players to absolutely despise the third party modding website is that the \"official modding\" was promised to be released over a year ago, but kept getting delayed. When it finally got released, everyone felt betrayed because it was a garbage third party website with so many restrictions.\n\nBut the reason why the game is still getting review bombed is the [b] developer's initial response [/b] to the first round of complaints. The team was dead silent for about 2 weeks, no comments about all the fiasco, yet people that were complaining about the modding on the chinese forums got their accounts banned left and right. Thats why many resorted to steam review bombing, and almost as soon as the steam review tanked, the developer came out and said the steam workshop will be launching in the end of the month, something he had being saying was \"really hard for the team\" and kept \"facing difficulties\" for the past year.\n\nSo yeah.... I kinda understand why people are still really mad about this one\n- Great Game, but 70 dollars for a game that was console exclusive for years, then released exclusive to Epic, and finally released to Steam. Don't be greedy Enix.\n- From my nine year old: \"We like that every screen you can stop and color, and if you don't want to color there is a story part to it. We really like to do both; there are puzzles, different colors and different sections. I would definitely recommend this game for five and up year olds.\"\n- This was released alongside about 10 other big Steam releases around the end of October 2022 and so it is very tempting to joke about how it's better than all of those combined, the real GOTY so on and so forth, as I'm sure has been done already. But what I noticed was that out of all those releases, this one had an emphasis on comedy, which is very difficult to execute successfully in any form of media. There is no voice acting or any high-budget production so how the dialogue and seemingly basic visuals/animations kept me entertained throughout, just like the previous 2 games (from memory) is a tremendous achievement. At a point where I have played a bazillion high-budget action games, and will honestly play a bazillion more, games like this only become more important in showcasing how creative independence is imperative in creating uplifting experiences.\nAfter the prologue, seeing Frog Detective step out of the train and the camera pausing on his full-body shot was akin to, say, if I saw Shepherd step out of the Normany in ME4, or if I saw Keanu step out of a train in John Wick 4, it was really on that level for me.\nThough, I feel like the dance scenes at the end of this game was a step-down from Frog Detective 2 unfortunately, but still good.\n\nEdit: I nominated this game for 'Outstanding Visual Style' Steam Award!\n- Overall, as a single player game Wargroove 2 is a tremendous improvement over the first game. The campaign is well designed and engaging, the writing is much improved and overall the gameplay is fun. The new roguelike conquest mode is a much more entertaining side thing than the godawful Arcade in 1, as well.\n\nAs a primary single player game, I hated Wargroove 1, and I can say that 2 has turned my opinion around - this game is fun, I finished the campaign and craved more, which is all you can really say! The only thing I really missed from 1 was the Puzzle mode, but maybe it'll show up in a future update? Who knows.\n\nThe major downsides is that the user interface is still the same terrible user interface that WG1 had without significant improvements, and the AI is still absolutely atrocious so playing even Vs maps against the AI is going to be pretty dull, but that hasn't changed from the first game. The soundtrack is not quite as catchy either.\n\nBut unlike WG1, I enjoyed my time with WG2 in spite of these shortcomings, and if you ever have a choice between the two, skip WG1 and just go straight into WG2.\n- THIS GAME HAS NO LOADING TIMES.\nIT IS INSTANT.\nNever again will a game satisfy me. I will sit, tormented, having experienced the purity of instant loading times. \nNever again... Will I be happy.\n\nThanks Taranto bros,\n10/freaking10\n- The problem with a lot of Steam reviews is that they don't really help you figure out whether you should buy / try the game. So, let me help. You are one of four people:\n\n(1) You've never played a Sam Barlow game before, and you've never played a point-and-click adventure game before. In which case, what's wrong with you?\n\n(2) You've never played a Sam Barlow game, but you have played a point-and-click adventure game before. In which case, you'll definitely know within two hours whether you like this game. But anyways, you're getting a decent bit of stuff for $20.\n\n(3) You've played a Sam Barlow game, and you didn't like it. In which case, you probably won't like this either. It's basically the same thing as Her Story and Telling Lies, but with a different story.\n\n(4) You've played a Sam Barlow game, and you did like it. In which case, you probably will like this too. It's basically the same thing as Her Story and Telling Lies, but with a different story.\n\nI think Immortality had the best story of the three Barlow games, and definitely the best acting and production value.\n- I did everything right[spoiler]and ended up in a relationship.[/spoiler]\n\nAccidently said one tiny lie.\n\nEverything in my life crumbles apart.\n\n11/10 Real Life Simulator\n- In 2013, after 10 years of waiting, the Sim City community of modders, fans, and aficionados rushed out to purchase the fifth installment of Sim City. Ten years is a long time to wait for a game, but people had a lot of faith in Maxis when they announced the title. Long story short, it was a massive dissapointment. Maxis and EA crippled Sim City 5 with DRM, Always On APM, tiny maps, forced origin installation, lacking mod support, no steam support, and a forced multiplayer aspect.  I decided to not purchase the title, so it may have been a decent game, but 2 years later a team of 12 people created a game that does everything maxis insisted was utterly and totaly impossible.  \n\nEverything the mod community did that kept Sim City 4 on the shelves in Wallmarts across America for an entire decade was ignored. Maxis (and to a lesser extent EA) ignored the fans, and gave the people who had kept them in business for twenty years a crippled subpar game.  And for that Maxis is now out of business. They will never make another game, and it is no one's fault but theirs.\n\nNow pretend none of that happened. It's 2013 again, and here it is people: Sim City 5. \n\nThe game balance is a bit on the easy side for veterans of the genre, but the potential map size is ENOURMOUS and customizing your city could fill up years of gameplay time.  The game runs so smoothly with so much going on, it really shows how lazy Maxis was with their approach.  The glass in buildings reflects the sun and the buildings near it, there are dynamic shadows, zoning is back, and it is not 'dumbed down'.  A single tile in this game is twice the size of the alloted map in Sim City, and you can purchase dozens of additional tiles to expand.  The map editor is awesome, the community is thriving, there are mods to do anything you want, and this is the city building game we've all been waiting for.  I can not possibly reccomend this more.\n- I'm not saying you should play this game, but if you do you can smoke \"dizzyweed\" with your dad and overthrow a fascist guy whose name literally means penis. Can not explain how much I started hyper fixating on this game.  This has had an irreversible change on my personality.\n- I played all I needed to realise this game has no intuition, no fun, no useful or interesting mechanics. It's deadass a flash game but somehow is less stable.\n\nConstant crashes and forced 480p fullscreen. \n\n0.5/10\n- An Excelent, well polished shmup(except for one technical fault) with great graphics and music.\n\nNot much to say other than it has fun boss fights with some creative bullet patterns, you have a gauge that fills up and when activated it doubles your fire power, and also you have bombs. If you have bombs and you get hit, you lose all of your bombs instead of just dying straight out, so you essentially have 2 hit points. You have a graze meter as well, meaning that if bullets pass by you it fills that meter up, when it is full, all bullets around you are basically nullified, and any enemy you kill, any bullets it fired at you will also get nullified. When you pass through the nullifeid bullets, it will fill the first gauge I mentioned so you can go ape s**t more often.\n\nIt's fairly simple, but the pace of the game takes a little while to get used to, the speed of your ship releative to the bullets is a little too slow but it's not game breaking. The only major issue is that my controller is not detectable by the game so I have to use joytokey, so I can't make full use of my controllers analog controls.\n- This game is basically awesome, under 3 conditions:\n\n1- You get rid of all on-screen icons (i.e. incoming attacks, ennemy spotting)\n2- Do not care about secondary missions only here to further lenghten the game's lifespan\n3- Play the game as you would if  YOU were in charge\n\nBasically, nevermind the Ubisoft micro transactions' system and other abhorrent company induced  greed-leaned system to get stuff faster and more easily by robbing you out of your hard-earned cash...you can finish the game without spending a single dime in the store, it's all pay to win...\nThe open-world aspect is very satisfying and rewarding, in terms of progression, don't fall for the micro transaction system\nCombat is easy even in the highest difficulty setting, but makes you think you are badass when you slash through waves of ennemies, whose AI is rather basic, with your arsenal of rockets, LMGs and explosives but it is satisfying as fuck!\n\nImagine strapping C4 to your plane, jump out of it, have it crashing down an ennemy outpost meanwhile you are parachuting down and throwing hand grenades their way, land on a roof and eliminate the remaining ennemies with fire ammo shotgun and a motherfucking M60 with armor-piercing bullets while throwing dynamites and there you have it...FarCry5 in a nutshell\n\nOh and don't forget about the flame-thrower lol, who doesn't love a flame-thrower scorching ennemies to their own demise eh?\n\nFarCry5 got it all, extreme freedom of how you wanna handle a situation (stealthily or all guns blazing) while being challenging enough in the highest difficulty setting!\nP.S. don't forget to turn off all the on-screen icons, really ruins it for hardcore FPS fans by making it extremely easy, please hear me out, you don't need these!\n- One of the best most fun and addicting all-time games. However, the plants should be nazi's and the zombies should be jews. There is also a hispanic snail in your garden that sleeps on the job.\n- Basic RPG with phenomenal music. Very linear nearly no exploration. Short and didn't overstay it's welcome. Not bloated with useless content like a lot of JRPG's. Some comedy. No gear or weapons to loot. Definitely took inspiration from Sailor Moon. Didn't provide much of a challenge. However I enjoyed my time with it, 100% in under 8 hours. It was a decent game. 7/10\n- ✔ Procedurally generated levels (some are not)\n✔ Neat graphics and animations\n✔ Good sound design\n✔ Solid and gratifying game mechanics \n✔ Well-balanced difficulty curve\n✔ Linux support!\n\n✘ No DRM-free build (yet?)\n✘ No user-generated content (no level editor)\n\nRuns surprisingly well on very low-end specs computer (under Linux too!).\nAn excellent turned-based action strategy game. Very polished and entertaining!\nYet one more proof that Swedish developers are among the best on this planet.\n- Nobody is gonna read this but here we go.... \nI recommend it, especially people who are really into classic Sonic. It plays like the Genesis games and is updated to incorporate elements and stages from each one, including Sonic CD. What it makes up for in updated graphics, music, and ideas, it loses in length of stage and just overall.... stage design. What I loved about the classic Sonic is that it felt like a choice to either blow through it or explore.. this one makes even the first level of each stage take about 5 or 6 minutes to get through... and then fight a boss. Overkill in my opinion, takes away what I liked about classic Sonic games... the speed. Still pretty good considering how much Sega has messed with Sonic throughout the years.\n- This game has such a HUGE potential like Stardew Valley in its early days!!\nCollecting stuff, helping people by crafting potions its so rewarding and lovely pls dear developers keep working on it. I BEG YOU! :D\nSure it has some bug right now but even on day one they managed to get some fast fixes and tried their best to make it work for everyone. \nThe controls were a bit tricky in the beginning (used Playstation 5 Controller) but its just a matter of time, its just not the normal controls like in other games.\nThe music was pretty nice and chill and also the animations were super cute, i love watching little Rubrum built his sandcastles over and over again. >3< \n\nOverall a good game, but could become even more better in the future, keep going guys!!\n- Dave the Diver is a charming little 'Indie'* that still surprises you with new mechanics even hours in. The various activity cutscenes are pretty funny as well.\n\nJust a word of warning though. Mintrocket is NOT a indie studio, it's a subsidiary of NEXON, so DtD is entirely a NEXON game, and with how their reputation is it's pretty understandable to not buy this game just because of that.\n- I love this game so much, but I am very conflicted about it. Since the beta I wondered why mods on the mod page on the Chucklefish website were sometimes incorporated into the base game and now I know why.\n\nThe devs of this game ultimately have amazing talent behind them, but they've exploited those they've called \"volunteer developers\". Promising \"exposure\" as a form of payment, and ultimately delivering neither payment, or giving their \"volunteers\" a spotlight on their own steam page or website. \n\nStill, you and I'd both buy nestle products even if they were made by child laborers, Nike shoes made by sweatshop workers, and beauty cosmetics that harm animals and even harm us when we use them. Even making the most *perfect* product doesn't make you immune to criticism for gross business practices.\n\nStarbound is a fantastic game, with incredible mod support, a fantastic soundtrack, and just all around an amazing game even if it does have shoddy server support. It's essentially Terraria in space with a more engaging visual and music style yet shallower combat. It's much easier to approach than Terraria, without as much content. Still, I absolutely enjoy this game over Terraria.\n\nI love this game, but dislike the people who made this game. It took me a while to write this because I wanted to see if the devs would make up for their disregard for their \"volunteers\". They did not.\n- I got this game for $12 off humble bundle. Me and my friends play it for hours on end. This game honestly feels like the perfect fighting game for me because there is no set style. I don't have to remember specific combos or any crazy inputs. It's just simplicity. Unless you want to do that in which you can. But it's fun for anyone. If I were you I would get it off of humble bundle for $12.\n- This is everything a remaster is supposed to be. You remember playing this game over a decade ago, and the graphics weren't \"that bad\". But nostalgia is a cruel mistress. You play the original again, and you can barely stand it.\n\nThe comes the HD version, which was alright, playable. But then, the real remaster, the Definitive Edition, you start playing the game and it FEELS like it used to feel. Like it is supposed to look. It is quite obviously way better than it used to be, but it FEELS the same.\n\nIf you ever liked playing this game, and want to play it again, this won't disappoint you. Especially with the distinct lack of RTS games in the last decade or so, this still holds true as one of the best ones.\n- Before you buy: What you enjoy about Her Story (and maybe Telling lies) will very much affect your enjoyment of this game. \n\nIf you enjoyed the acting, the non-linear story telling, and the *movie* part of those games, this will probably be the best in the trilogy. HOWEVER, if you enjoy the detective aspect, the puzzles, the mental challenge, this game is probably not for you.\n\nThe gameplay is a big departure compared to Her Story and Telling Lies, and in my opinion, doesn't make for much of a challenge at all. In the 10 hours I spent on the game, 9 were just me watching clips and clicking random objects in the background. I found the actual movie stuff to be really fun (and especially seeing the process of how movies are made), but that kind of fun is very different to the kind I had with the previous two games.\n\nI don't dislike the game but I don't recommend it either, at least to a decent chunk of the fanbase (those being fans of detective puzzle games).\n- I left home with nothing but a needle and my granny's briefcase full o' snakes, hitched a ride to Boring Springs, killed two men and three snakes, learned to speak Goblin, and befriended a woman whose home was burned to the ground by a gang of cows. Then I bought a horse and left the tutorial area, and things got weird. I'm pretty on board with this one.\n- I was a playtester on this game, and I can say with authority, love and joy and care all radiate out of the work that was put into making this game. It still has the same Psychonauts wackiness and great comedy, but it's also become more mature, more understanding, more willing to tackle dark topics head on and acknowledge that human beings are flawed, and need help, and make mistakes, and sometimes even do awful things. But Psychonauts 2 understands that human beings aren't defined by any of this, and that people can learn from their wrongs and can change for the better. And it tells all this through a delicious array of gorgeous, varied mental landscapes, through creative collectibles that reveal the memories, loves, and regrets of the colorful cast, and through a combat and platforming system that is much improved from its predecessor. I can't recommend this game enough. It's an emotional triumph.\n- It's hard to recommend Spelunky 2. Not because it is a bad game, but because it can be frustrating. As with most roguelikes, dying means going back to the beginning. In Spelunky however, nothing carries over to future runs. All you get to bring in to your next run is your own experience and knowledge; And when half the things in the game kill you instantly or stunlock you to death, having a great run end in a quick death can be damaging to one's will.\n\nThankfully, your own experiences count a great deal towards your progress. Most hazards and enemies in Spelunky 2 have a very simple and predictable behaviour. But keeping track of everything on the screen is still a challenge. Enemies and traps will also work together (or against each other) and still bring your demise somehow. Either by bumping your helplessly stunned body into other enemies and traps, or enemies having their own flaming corpse launched towards you and your flammable jetpack. It's actually quite funny sometimes. A good deal of entertainment can be had recording your own amazingly nonsensical deaths.\n\nSpelunky 2 improves upon Spelunky HD's gameplay by adding split paths, which allow for more variety and decision-making in your runs while staying true to the feeling and style of previous entries. It also adds a back layer to each level, allowing for more secrets to be kept. After successfully completing your first run, you can try to discover these secrets and find hidden bosses and areas and even different endings!\n\nAnyway, you might enjoy the game if you're a masochist or something.\n- If you played the OG this is basically the same but with a few added side stories you can unlock as you complete different routes in the game. The extra dlc maybe would take you a bit over an hour to complete all of them if you speed through it, but does not have any optional dialogue so it's more of just some lore and extra character interactions. Still pretty solid dlc if you are a fan and want a little bit of extra stuff :)\n- *Sigh* This game was just tiring. I wouldn't come to say it was a complete rip off of Paper's Please, but it was a very similar game but just worse. Mainly to the point that I played, at most, 10 minutes, I saw multiple repeats of the same messages, and the only updates were legislation, unlike in Papers, Please where you got new rules and new tools almost every day. I won't completely judge the game since I haven't played it the entire way through, but it's just not very good. Plain and simple.\n- Only one word to describe this game\n\nOutdated.\n\nThere is no real point to get this game unless you want a slightly better looking UI and atmosphere. L4D2 already contains the campaigns from L4D1 and is where the entire Left 4 Dead community is. Only a small playerbase still plays l4d1, mostly out of nostalgia. But there is quite literally no reason to get the game.\n\nYou can grab it if you are into achievements, but only do so when it goes on sale, i grabbed it for a couple penny, still a bad idea.\n- The weakest RE since RE6. \n\nFeels half baked as heck on a game design level. Too many damn cutscenes and areas where you're just on rails. Really, the game design seems to take a massive step back from RE7 and even a bigger step back in terms of puzzles. Really a shame.\n\nNot to mention the performance is pretty terrible and inconsistent. Not to mention the lack of full keyboard bindings and support. Really, this port feels like a whole afterthought to a game that already feels like an afterthought.\n\nIt does get better on the back end but not enough to balance out that weak front end.\n- Imbalanced, stupid 4+ v 1 situations which aren't in your favour, buggy hitboxes (e.g some blocks won't work), skill biased: You will be killed so many times before for you will get remotley good. But there is no way you can get better when Sir Rapealot who is level 50, who dominates your team, one hit stabs you everytime. \n\nHowever, this is a blast with friends. But it takes alot of convincing to get everyone to play this game because of the things I previously stated. \n\nThis game is completley based on skill which you cannot obtain without 8+ hours of death, death and death. \n\n****** DEFINITLEY NOT WORTH FULL PRICE ******\n- I pirated this game first and loved it so much I ended up buying it. It's that good!\n\nIt's worth your money and time. I promise.\n- One of the best most fun and addicting all-time games. However, the plants should be nazi's and the zombies should be jews. There is also a hispanic snail in your garden that sleeps on the job.\n- i bought a fighting game and ended up playing dress-up\n- This is a game, a story, about love. \n\nIt's also about time, tragedy, about hope, hate, despair and everything that falls in between. It revolves around a cursed mansion and its inhabitants in different time periods and explores and questions themes like identity, trust, desire, violence, society, redemption, reincarnation, [i]reconstruction[/i]; a mind bending reexamination of lives lived. \n\nIt's about the big things in life but it's also about the little things. The things that constantly shapes us when we're not really looking, that gives our day-to-day its meaning and substance. \n\nBut more than anything, it's about the complexities of love. Love as a motivator, a discomfort, a longing, a heartache, a blessing, a curse, but most of all, as a relationship: the uneasy steps out of individual comfort zones and the creation of something new together. Love as a path to growth.\n\nIt's almost perplexing how they manage to make it all work, it's structurally among the most ambitious tales I've ever witnessed in video games, but they do, it does work, the missteps are few, the memories of it all absolutely enchanting.\n\nIt wouldn't have worked without the astonishing soundtrack. It handles everything with surprising ease, frames every scene with emotion and wonder. \n\nIt wouldn't have worked without the art, the beautiful depictions of scenery and life, the characters and their subtle expressions.\n\nIt wouldn't have worked without the interaction, the implications of the choices feels real.\n\nIt wouldn't have worked without the prose, but it wouldn't have worked as [i]just[/i] prose. \n\nWhich is why it's a video game.\n\nAnd it's the greatest love story on Steam.\n- [H1]At this price point it's hard not to recommend it, but there's a lot -better- bullet hell games out there...[/H1]\n\nDanmaku unlimited as a series is great. Don't get me wrong. It really is. But it suffers the curse of being put in with a field on Steam that is made up of even greater company. Bug Princess by Cave has the brutal difficulty angle sewn up, Ikaruga has the absolute classic angle nailed, Jamestown has the glorious pixel-art sorted. In order to stand out in this genre, you absolutely have to bring something new to the table.\n\nAs good as Danmaku Unlimited is, it does not bring anything new to the table. It brings a lot of -good-, but nothing -new-. The greatest sin here is that if you've played a lot of bullet hells, this is going to feel immensely familiar, and you're going to blast through it fast, nothing is prone to catch you out. At all. Now that may be a plus point, if that's what you're after, but if you're seeking something to change up the formula? Yeeeeee-no.\n\n[H1]So it's the Bullet Hell version of Destiny?[/H1]\n\nMechanically, it works great. You have a ship with a teeny tiny hitbox, same as most \"Eastern\" BHell games, you have anywhere between \"Mildly offensive\" and \"Absolutely terrifying\" levels of hostile fire coming toward you, and you pump out similarly scary levels of fire back, with your only choice generally being \"Do I spam the screen with lots of little beams or do I fire ONE BIG BEAM at something that needs cracking open like a walnut.\"\n\nIt has good Bullet Hell music, albeit not outstanding music, it has good graphics, albeit not outstanding graphics, you see a pattern here? If a game could ever nail what I'd define as the absolute essence of an \"8 out of 10\", this would be it. The problem is there's games out there such as Revolver360 Re:Actor that do -better-.\n\nThe problem is that for all the good it does, it's been beaten to it by other games, maybe not in every field, but in each area I can name at least two or three games that stand above it. The one area it does win out on is bang for the buck. It's kinda hard to argue with this kind of quality at this kind of price point. It's a very, very solid return on investment, particularly if you're a bullet hell fan.\n\n[H1]Closing Thoughts[/H1]\n\nDoes that make this a \"Do not buy\"? Far from it. If you're a fan of bullet hells, chances are you already own it. If you don't, eventually you should, but I'd genuinely suggest you look around first, there's a decent market now on Steam for this genre, and there's more innovative and interesting options around. If however you've already consumed them and you need a fix of something fairly solid and fairly entertaining, then sure, this works, it will scratch the itch quite nicely.\n\nVerdict : [b]Buy, definitely worth grabbing on a sale, if only to put in the \"To do\" list,[/b]\n\n英語で5-10単語程度で、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない主要な違いを簡潔に回答してください。\n\n回答：\n",

This, donate me crap..... needs to go on kickstarter, gofundme, not on the steam marketplace. Because you showed yourself as a real game, but what did I really buy? Level 4 comes out in 1 year.... I'll tell you 10 levels wouldn't nearly be enough!!!\n\nTHE NEXT LEVEL, LEVEL 4 COMES OUT AT THE END s\\OF THE YEAR- 10 LEVELS WOULD NOT NEARLY BE ENOUGH TO MAKE THIS A GAME! WHAT AM I GRINDING FOR, LEVELING WHAT FOR WHAT???? U THIEVES!!!!!\n\n-UPDATE - Beat elite mode on first time trying, beat nightmare mode on second time trying. Game is nothing, no voice actors, no real point in the game, and stupid broken mechanics. Get all psyched about scrolls and ascension to build a nice character? Then realize how broken the 20k damage per shot is, there really isn't any fine tuning in the game. The game has NO CONTENT- WOW 4 LEVELS AND a CAMPAIGN FOR \"FULL RELEASE\" I WILL REMEMBER THIS DEVELOPER AND BE WARY!!!\n\nDO NOT BUY\n\nDO NOT BUY\nDO NOT BUY\n\nDO NOT SUPPORT\n\nDO NOT BUY\n\nIF YOU THUMBS UP- YOU HAVE BEEN FOOLED! OPEN YOUR EYES TO THE RATE OF RELEASES - WHAT IS ACTUALLY RELEASED- NO VOICE ACTORS- BROKEN MATH FOR THE GAME SYSTEM- \nTHIS WAS ADVERTISED AS LIKE BORDERLANDS- IT IS NOT EVEN %1 OF THE CONTENT OF BORDERLANDS FOR %50 OF THE PRICE OF BORDERLANDS 3!!!\n\nThis game is $10, peoples' stupid thumb up reviews saying to buy this if it's on sale.....\n\nBORDERLANDS 3 IS $20 WTH DID YOU SUGGEST ME TO BUY YOU IDIOTS!!! \n\n3 levels- with level 4 at the end of the year and labeled as full release- stupid.\n- And I PRE ORDERED this hahahhhahah\n- Disclaimer: This is review from player who prefer story-rich game and haven't played any game by Arkhouse Telegraph.\n\nThe good:\n+ Outstanding 80's-esque visual pixel artstyle. It reminds me of few SNES/Atari/Gameboy games.\n+ Fairly good soundtrack.\n+ Some cutscene/area have fascinating atmosphere.\n+ Run well with Steam proton, so it's likely this game is playable for Linux/Steam Deck user. Although the platformer area might show too many small detail for 7\" display.\n+ Game OST/artbook is available for free on Arkhouse website.\n\nThe bad:\n- While i understand nature of this game require player to find out most thing and go through trial-and-error, some parts definitely need to be explained better. I refer to lack of autosave (for most part of the game), not letting player know about manual save (you can do it by head left after exit for cylinder elevator until you see display/sign \"< S\" and suggestion to visit block H (where you get some guidance).\n- While the manual say i can play R. U. N. E. 3000 first, i have hard time understanding the story and lore/world building. Conversation such as \"DO? DORODO!\" is mostly gibberish and i only can make vague guess based on few specific term (\"V2\", \"50/50\", etc.) and area i've visited. Short recap of previous games (even it's on the manual) could be really helpful for newcomers.\n\nThe ugly:\n* I experience a bug where i fight boss i'm not supposed to fight yet. In detail, [spoiler] after i exit from P block to get symbol cracking code, i was thrown to G block where i fight G-Cat/10th boss. The worst part is the boss HP bar started with red color and auto 3-60 cannon never perform attack. Fortunately the bug doesn't occur again after i load from manual save.  [/spoiler].\n* The gameplay variation/idea is very interesting, but the execution is mixed bags (more explanation on below paragraph)\n\nSaturn Quest: R. U. N. E. 3000 has lots of gameplay variant/modes (Adventure, Shoot'em up, Platformer and many more) to keep the game fresh. While each area/boss have different reason why it's challenging/difficult, many of those is very unbalanced. For example, [spoiler] Bioplatus M-3D/6th boss [/spoiler] require you to have extraordinary eye-hand coordination and multitasking skill. Among all enemy that resemble boss fight, i only managed to beat 6-7 boss without using cheat.\n\nThis game also has very few checkpoint on each area/boss. On adventure/platformer area, you could restart from beginning after spending 10-20 minutes where you have to avoid same trap or collect same item again. On boss fight, that means you'll need to repeat whole fight most of the time. It's could be annoying because since you're forced to find out boss behavior the hard way or repeating tedious part of the fight.\n\n3 HP and lack of difficulty option could be irritating for most modern player. There are time when i found out i only lose 3-10 HP when i use cheat and beat the boss. If there's easier difficulty where i have 6-10 HP, i could beat more boss by myself. But don't get me wrong, i feel really satisfied each time i beat boss (which i deemed can be beaten with practical amount of effort) without cheat. If the developer bother add easy difficulty which has higher player HP, give more Nana and slightly lower boss HP, far more people could enjoy this unique piece of artwork.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nWhile i have some rant, it's really unique experience even though i've played few hundred games. In overall, i have more positive sentiment than negative sentiment of this game. But even though i choose \"Yes\" when Steam ask \"Do you recommend this game?\", i'd rather choose \"Neutral\" or \"Information\" instead. If you're fan of 80's game or really like difficult game, you might come to like this game. But for most people, i'd recommend you to seek other game. Although if you really insist to play this game, you could use Cheat Engine and modify HP/Nana using value type Double (also called float64 or 8-byte float).\n\nP.S. I definitely will play the sequel (Episode IV-VI: White Meteor Saga according to the artbook) [b]IF[/b] the developer bother add easy difficulty option and more checkpoint during boss fight/exploration.\n- I've been completely in love with this game ever since the Mojam prototype \"Wasteland Kings\" was released. It's an insanely fun, fastpaced \"roguelike-like\" or \"roguelite\" with randomly generated worlds and tons of weapons to find. On top of that, the developers stream the development of the game on tuesdays and thursdays over at Twitch and they release updates to the game every week. To me, this is the best game of its kind and I've put tons of hours into mastering it (and I still die. Often. It's difficult okay?).\n- Little over three hours in; Familar puzzles are back, traps are back, backtracking and exploring (in a fun way) is back, trying not to shit yourself while you run through a hallway to conserve ammo as several giant things try to kill you is back, ridiculous humor mixed with gameplay is back, classic Resident Evil storytelling is back...\n\nWelcome Back Resident Evil, you were missed.\n\nEdit: I cheered at the end, and almost woke my wife and son up at six in the morning. I'm glad I avoided the spoilers. \n\nWelcome back [Redacted] and [Redacted], I'll be waiting for the free DLC.\n- I have played OSU!, Muse Dash and stepmania plenty and I gotta say that this does not feel like a rhythm game at all. The premise of matching the shape of the map to music sounds interesting but some of the songs I feel like are not mapped out correctly. Or in general this game relies less on music cues and more on visual cues? It felt like maps are only 50% related to the song and you have to ignore what you hear because the map randomly demands patterns that have no matching audio equivalent and everything becomes pure visual memorization.\n- Hoooh boy, this game sneaks up on you! It seems like any other chill little puzzle game at first. You're enjoying how it tickles the logical part of your brain and maybe even start to feel a little cocky after you've understood the mechanics, like you've outsmarted the game because you've figured out where the enemies are and beat the king for the first time... \n\n...and suddenly it's past midnight. You just nuked every enemy on the map with one attack, jumping in and out of the shadows on a pacifist run or chaining perfectly planned combos for zero energy while thinking \"just one more round, I was so close to getting the king on the highest difficulty!!\"\n\nThe music is well balanced to keep it exciting while not ruining your focus.\nThe art has a handcrafted quality, is easy on the eyes and is cute (even as the enemies turn to skeletons!).\nThe gameplay is easy to get into even for a dumb-dumb like me. It's fun but challenging and I find myself coming back for more even after clearing it all!\n\nOver all, I give this game a 2.75 out of 2.8! (My cat came up with the scoring system, please don't tease him he is very self-conscious about it).\n- I played the F*CK out of RE4 back in the day.. I was sooo hyped for this but its just not RE4.. I get it's a remake but it's not a good one. Which sucks because I LOVED the RE2 remake.. Idk. Maybe it's just me but I cannot recommend this if you loved the original. Maybe newcomers will like it.\n\nEdit after 18 more hours: the original is still better but this remake is not bad. I can recommend it.\n- I did everything right[spoiler]and ended up in a relationship.[/spoiler]\n\nAccidently said one tiny lie.\n\nEverything in my life crumbles apart.\n\n11/10 Real Life Simulator\n- Volition ups the silly, and adds super powers, but loses a little something along the way.\n\nI loved Saint's Row: the Third, and by all rights should have loved IV as well, but I mostly just liked it. The set up was fun, and seemed to up the ante again, but then you get the presidency ripped away from you almost immediately (without even seeing the consequences of your first pushed legislation!). Placing the game in a virtual city for the most part with the only real characters being on your space ship, really kinda seemed to gut the game. Even when [spoiler]the world gets destroyed[/spoiler], a detached, \"meh\" was all I could muster. The humor is there, but it's mostly better in the DLC. The radio stations feel kind of underwhelming without DJs.\n\nFinally all the fun of collecting and customizing various interesting cars, and finding ways to climb or fall to interesting places with a stolen plane/parachute are gutted with the inclusion of super powers. Also, the super powers make gunplay, leveling any of your other stuff, and pretty much every mechanic carried over from Saints Row: the Third obsolete.\n\nIf you get this game, do yourself a favor and make sure you get all the DLC where most of the real fun is. Is it as good as the previous Saints Row? I don't think so, but I still recommend getting it and playing through it. It is a lot of fun, and I love the 50's break out scenario at the beginning.\n\nStacey's thoughts:\nStill awaiting DLC with Jane Austin and the D*ldo Bat. Can somebody make this, for, uhh, scientific purposes.\n- You can return to character customization whenever you want. Game of the year.\n- Katana ZERO? More like, Katana ZERO CONCLUSION.\n\nI had too high expectation on this game, I thought it was going to be Hotline Miami but better.\nIn the end I still prefer Hotline Miami, specifically Hotline Miami 2.\n\nOne thing I dislike is the lack of combo scoring system. \nIt's a good way to make the players act fast and execute their actions flawlessly, instead the game only has a timer bar that never runs out as a way to motivate the player to go fast.\n\nI am aware how \"pointless\" game scores are.\nBut seeing a number going up feels good.\n\nWhat happens when you kill an enemy in Hotline Miami?\n - You get to see a number pops out, and the score goes up indicating that you are doing good!\n - Satisfying bloody hit sound.\n - Throbbing light on the edge of the map.\n - Randomized dead sprite of the enemy, sometimes they get dismembered depending on the weapon.\n\nIn Katana ZERO you'd get :\n - A \"fwoob\" sound.\n - A same dying animation of the enemy getting knocked and bleed to death. Instead of getting decapitated or something.\n - Flashy slash effect.\n\nAt one point I wondered on why should I even bother killing the enemies when it didn't reward me with anything in the room with a minecart. \nWhen having the enemy being killed by the minecart or the player makes no difference.\n\n[spoiler]More like Katana ZERO REWARD. I think this is it, exactly why I am disappointed by it. Imagine playing soulsbornekiro or Hollow Knight without earning any kind of currency??? Killing the enemies would feel pointless.[/spoiler]\n\nIt's basically way more fun and rewarding to kill an enemy in Hotline Miami than Katana ZERO.\n\nThen there are other stuff like...\nUnfun stealth gameplay. \nRollspamming without consequence.\nBeing able to endlessly doing a mid air attack without having to touch the ground first.\n\nThere are also waaaay too many checkpoints in my opinion, it encouraged me to just brute force everything with roll spamming without having to worry about starting over.\nThe rooms could've been a bit bigger and longer. But also less room, quality over quantity.\n\nAnd finally, the story.\nI was intrigued by it but it just ended abruptly with a \"To be continued\".\nIt's like they only wrote 50% of it then slapped a \"To be continued\" and called it a day.\nThe game seems to rely heavily on \"mentioning stuff off screen that player will never get to see\" to tease the player.\nI already knew that the game is going to be short, but I didn't expect it to be this disappointing. \n\nIt's not a bad game, I just had the wrong expectation.\n\nI might change it to positive if I was satisfied by the DLC.\nOr maybe after beating the hard mode, I heard it's more fun.\n- The latest S tier Deckbuilder Roguelike, joining the ranks of Slay the Spire and Monster Train for me. I think that's all that really needs to be said.\n\nIt leans heavily into kiss/curse type effects, if you like the ability to manipulate rng and do some busted stuff with your sequencing you will love it. It is more of a thinker on a turn to turn basis than other games of this genre, but if that isn't a turn off then it's a really solid game with some unique characters/mechanics that feel fresh.\n- Ok to make it short.\n\n- Poor graphics (like 10 years old PC game)\nBUT nothing more to complain about.\n\n- great atmosphere, great story, very good fighting mechanics. Of course great price.\n\nIf you have nothing against japan style - just play the game. One of funniest games in some years for me.\n- Ratchet & Clank is always fun. The older games are clearly better, as it feels like the more modern they get, the shallower and simpler they become. They now feel almost like a demo of a game - you just get to dip your toe into each of the systems, never really fully engaging with any of them. New abilities are just thrown at you with no fanfare, and then you only need them 3 times, and it never asks you to combine them in new ways. Everything feels underwhelming and tossed aside shortly after being introduced. That's almost the theme of the game - they even have Ratchet meeting a fellow Lombax for the first time ever, the thing he has been focused on since game 1, and it's pretty much just \"hi, let's go do the next thing.\" The series has been casualized, just as neutered as their formerly innuendo-laden titles. \n\nBut it's still fun to play, it's just lacking the magic it used to have.\n- very complicated game and the tutorial is good at explaining the high level concepts but you will struggle with basic things like 'how do i get more gold'. \n\nfurther it may take a while to get into the game. for example i found it very hard - but i realised it was trying to do too much in a single lifetime and instead needed to focus on the long game while roleplaying each character. In that regard crusader kings 3 is different to other stratagy games like total war or stellaris - which encourage you to snowball the map. At the moment it doesn't seem that straightforward.\n\nthere are a few AI quirks in particular with combat - i've seen enemies embark/dissembark troops for years which should be costing them gold each time they embark.\n- Do yourself a favor.  Go in as blind as possible.  Don't look at any guides.  The system of getting pages of the manual that you can't fully understand is a stroke of genius.\n\nAlso I haven't found a waterfall that *doesn't* have a secret behind it.\n\n**EDIT: Finished the game**\n\nI'll admit for many of the later \"post-game puzzles\" I looked at a guide for.  The in game language is very difficult to decipher blindly, and if you're not familiar with English you probably shouldn't even bother.  \n\nThe surprising thing about this game is you can pretty much do any puzzle at any given time once you get one or two specific items, but because of how the manual is handled, you'll never know how until you see the pages (or experiment a lot)\n\nI think the most amount of tries I've spent on a boss fight was 7-8, but nothing is stopping you from exploring more and finding stat boosts.\n- What can I say that hasn't been said and that you don't know.\nThis game is IN-SANE.\nThe attention to detail is mind-boggling, the missions, from the smallest to all the main missions are worthy of oscars.\nThe single player campaign is one of the best adventures I ever went on in my life. This is why I love games.\nThe beauty of this game in indescribable. It's one of most realistic living worlds I've ever been in.\nIn fact, it felt so real to me, that I would spend hours living and breathing the game, I felt I was there, at that time.\nTaking care of my horse, spending time fishing and hunting, sometimes for hours.\nRiding my horse in strong winds, and heavy rain, collecting every piece of clothing and trying to look dashing at all times.\nI got attached to people, took care of them, or dragged them behind my horse when I wasn't in the mood for their BS.\nI've been there. I lived there. That was me, I was a cowboy. Nobody will convince me otherwise.\n- Ok, so... one of my favourite films of my childhood. HOWEVER; not being able to start in SANDBOX mode from the start almost INSTANTLY put me off this title, I mean, really? So you have to complete the in-game island tasks/missions (***)*)*)*)*). And after only 4 hours of play through.... \n\nSPOILER ALERT: Dinosaurs escape their enclosures!! ALL THE TIME, its frankly trying to emulate the movie (Jurassic Park 1) as where the DIno's always escape and again SPOILER ALERT: THE INTROS TO EVERY PART OF THE GAME BASICALLY TELL YOU THIS IS DEFO GOING TO HAPPEN.\n\nTo conclude:\n\n1) There is a heavy lean on the movies (I personally don't think that's bad)\n2) It offers a SANDBOX within the opening screen however then informs this is blocked (WHICH IS ANNOYING) until certain missions have been completed.\n3)  DINOSAURS ESCAPE CONSTANTLY\n4) DINOSAURS ESCAPE CONSTANTLY\n5) The game is more interested in visuals rather than content\n- The best game ever made by Valve. Great story, beautiful dialogues with funny jokes, interesting puzzles, perfect atmosphere and a lot of fun in co-op with friends. You made a great work, Valve, and thank You for this absolute masterpiece.\n10/10.\n- Playing this game instantly brought back memories of me playing TMNT, Battletoads, Double Dragon, and Streets of Rage, with my little brother on the NES and Sega Genesis in the early 90s. Luckily this game doesn’t feature TMNT’s ridiculous water level or Battletoads' sadistic peed bike level. The graphics are perfect, the controls are great, the soundtrack is awesome (especially the Wu-Tang stage, and the Shredder stage), and the levels and overworld map are fun to navigate. I’ve played through the story mode with all 7 characters and have played through the arcade mode multiple times solo and many times in multiplayer and I’ve enjoyed every bit of it. This game is so much fun.\n\nThere are a few things I wish existed though. I wish there were more playable characters. I wish that you did not lose your 7 character’s progress in story mode when you start a new game. I wish you could see the difficulty level of the online arcade game you are joining. I wish there were cumulative stats you could see for arcade and story mode that showed the number of times you completed a stage, how many enemies you knocked out, objects you’ve destroyed, stage times, combo streaks, times taunted, etc. I wish you could create your own turtle and assigned moves, specials, jumps, taunts, and colors.\n- Her story starts you off in an old looking computer with what looks like Windows 95, or perhaps a previous version. Once there you are presented with a database of footage from a 1990s, where you must piece together what happened.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\nWithout spoiling anything, since this game is all story based, you are revisiting video clips of seven separate interviews trying to piece together what exactly happened. When you start off, you are placed in front the pc with the word “murder” already typed in. With this simple word, you are given, you must, delve deeper into the story, and form your own conclusion as to what happened, but the more you go deeper into the mystery, the more confused you may become; perhaps even discarding your previous assumption many times before coming to a conclusion that does not go against her story.    \n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nThis game is not a conventional game in terms of gameplay. Instead, you are watching videos and finding potential terms that could lead you to more videos which will reveal more as to her past and what, and who was involved in this incident. Some might not like this, so if the idea of an exclusively story based game does not appeal, do not bother. It is an interesting concept, and very captivating if you play it without any distractions, perhaps more interesting if you play it with a friend and try to piece the mystery together (much like I did).\n\n[h1]Verdict: 8.5/10[/h1]\n\nIf you enjoyed this review, or found it helpful, please feel free to follow our curator [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/WeLoveKawaiiNekos#curation]here.[/url]\n- I'll lay it out. If you're really interested in the hacking mechanic, that might be sufficient reason to play this game. Otherwise, I'd be inclined to give it a miss.\n\nFrom a gameplay perspective, there's not really much to hook a new player. There's a long period at the start where you're expected to randomly interact with people, but given no reason why you should do so. The whole socializing and partying thing isn't intuitive unless you're a person who'd normally be into that, and there's little in the game that pushes you in that direction. As a result, progressing as far as the story actually starting is often the result of accident at best. It took me 4 hours of just wandering around, not knowing what I was supposed to be doing or why.\n\nOnce you're able to program there's a bit more direction and less frustration, but you're still not given much reason for doing it until later on.\n\nAll in all, stick around if you're really invested in getting to the programming. Otherwise, it's an exercise in frustration and shallow conversations that's not really a lot of fun.\n\nArt's gorgeous though, so the game has that going for it at least.\n- So, I only found this game because my favorite Vtuber Miilkywayz on Twitch played it. It seemed pretty interesting but when she started making her own cards. As an IRL witch I was WAY more interested. The game itself is great, I love making cards and learning their meanings and seeing how how the story changes changes based on your deck and the cards drawn. And the replaybility of it is amazing given its price. 10/10 from me. Need more games like this.\n- Uncharted 4: A Thief's End:\n\nThe ambitious end to a long running franchise, Uncharted 4: A Thief's End is a very fascinating game.\nThe gunplay is enjoyable, the puzzles are decent and the humor is pretty good, there are some hilarious character interactions.\n\nThe story though, isn't very deep but I liked the darker approach and the flashbacks, it's interesting enough to keep you playing, and it really makes you care for the characters.\n\nExploration works decently, but it could've been better, there are documents you can read or find collectibles. The open area in Madagascar was one of the best parts of the game in my opinion, the car handles very well and the driving feels phenomenal.\n\nLastly, climbing is a very big part of the game, and even though the climbing mechanics are very smooth, I really had to force myself to enjoy it some times, and I wish there was less of it.\n\nThe action sequences are easily the best thing about this game, some jaw-dropping set-pieces keep you on the edge of your seat.\n\nUncharted 4 is the definition of a \"Movie Videogame\".\nIt's absolutely gorgeous, the cinematography is outstanding, the performances are fantastic and the soundtrack fits well, but gameplay-wise it's just... exhausting, not because of the controls or the gunplay, but because of the hand-holding and the linearity.\n\nUncharted the Lost Legacy:\n\nUncharted the Lost Legacy is proof that Uncharted can great even without Nathan Drake. The Lost Legacy is essentially just more Uncharted 4, it's something like a stand-alone expansion, and a good one at that.\n\nHonestly, I am surprised, I enjoyed this more than I expected. Even though the gameplay is more of the same, there's less climbing, and the fact that the game is relatively short is mostly a positive.\n\nThe game rarely feels repetitive, every puzzle is different from each other, and there is also an open area in the middle of the game where you can explore, which was implemented very well.\n\nAs for Chloe and Nadine, they make a pretty nice duo, where's Chloe is likeable and a goofball, Nadine is the opposite, she's aggressive and focuses on her mission. I liked their chemistry and I think both characters work very well together.\n\nAnd now for the negatives, the story isn't necessarily bad, it's just very generic and there are no stakes. Also, in my personal opinion, the biggest flaw the game has is that there are barely any highlights in it, almost no action except from the last chapter, which is a complete letdown considering how the action is literally the best part about this series.\n\nOverall it's very solid, and for its size it's definitely worth checking out, a great stand-alone expansion.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThank you Sony! Both games runs surprisingly well and overall very fun games. Uncharted 2 is still my favorite tho, but i'm happy to see Uncharted 4 and the Lost Legacy finally on PC, Uncharted 1,2,3 when?\n- This does what I wish AAA RPGs with narratives would do; choices actually feel like they make an impact and the gameplay changes that reflect this are dynamic in nature and provide meaningful differences in the conversations.\n\nIt doesn't feel this way on a macro scale, the meaning is more in the individual encounters with some exceptions. To word it a little differently, I felt like my choices had very little impact on the story as a whole and I could easily (a little too easily) steer the final outcome at any time but, within individual interrogations, what I chose to do had a major affect on the immediate narrative.\n\nThat being said, it is a wonderful game to play for four to six hours on a Sunday and at $15 USD it is cheap and entertaining enough to only need a single playthrough to feel like you've gotten your money's worth. Although I haven't started my second playthrough, I'm already thinking about when I want to sit down and have another go.\n- getting better in controls, HUD, and resources management balances, unlike Rise TR\nslight improvement in graphics, OST is good though\nseveral 'cool' scenes, creativity has taken a great leap <applause>\ncross over with Assassin's Creed (due to same publisher?)\nLara is getting more and more 'demonic', no hard feelings, its just subliminary messages to the youth by major games coorporation\nI can't believe i can play as Lara Kid instead of Lara Croft :D '+1'\nstoryline is getting ridiculous, come back to earth bruh LOL its good fun\n\ngood luck on your future endeavour devs :)\n- Hello Charlotte is not a game; it is a confessional.\nIf you're here you've probably already realized, but I wish to place massive emphasis that Hello Charlotte, and Hello Charlotte 3 especially, has very little gameplay, and what is present is very standard RPGMaker fare. If you are the kind to balk at visual novels, HC3 will not be your cup of tea. Watch a playthrough or something if you're interested, but don't expect any kind of engaging play.\nWith that said: Hello Charlotte 3 (and its DLC, Heaven's Gate) has been one of the most emotional, impactful pieces of art I've ever engaged with. It is horrifically honest, incorrigibly vulnerable, and, as previously stated-- more a confessional than a game. With everything I know how to say and with everything I have to say about it, I cannot find a way to truly articulate what Hello Charlotte made me feel (still makes me feel) and how it has affected me.\n\nHello Charlotte: Childhood's End is from the perspective not of the Charlotte of the previous two games, but a new, blank slate PC. While not necessary to play the previous two games, I strongly recommend it. It develops on the themes of the previous two games, and in doing so, completely recontextualizes them. C and Anri of HC2 return, as does Scarlett, though not in the forms we are accustomed to. We are finally given a full understanding on the nature of Charlotte and the False Realm, and what we are in relation to it.\netherane's art has markedly improved since the second game, with impressive sprite and background artwork, though their style is still recognizable. The music (some composed by etherane, others outsourced) is varied and distinctive. Most prominent about etherane's work, however, are the themes and writing, which have matured considerably since the release of HC2. Though often garish and on the nose, HC3 is a poignant commentary on the nature of art and fiction, the impact we have on one another, and our understanding of realness itself.\nYou will experience confusion. You will experience whiplash. The game intends to make you unsure and uncomfortable in its consumption, <i>deliberately</i> so. In the process it becomes a jarring, distinctive work of art unique to its creator and an important representation of the Millenial psyche. It's a psychological horror game and by God will it force you to experience psychological horror.\n- Oh boy. DoDonPachi Resurrection.\nI love this game. Its loads of modes, tight controls, great bullet patterns, and fun gameplay and scoring mechanics make it an awesome shooter. \nThat being said, this game is tough as nails. Even the novice mode is hard as heck and definitely isn't novice-friendly. I reccomend having one or two shmup clears under your belt before you try to tackle DoDonPachi. (Crimzon Clover's novice mode is a good introduction to shmupping) You need some skill to get the maximum amount of enjoyment out of this game.\n\nStill, though, It's awesome! DoDonPachi Resurrection is a very fun experience, even with it's difficulty.\n\n- I have been a big fan of the Halo series since CE so I may be a bit biased but yea.\n\nPositives\n- Good campaign\n- Fun coop\n- Good story\n- Good mechanics\n- Graphics are good\n- Good price, honestly don't wouldn't even wait for it to go on sale\n\nCons\n- I have noticed a sound delay every now and again\n- A few graphical glitches every now and again, not really regular\n- The fact they exchanged the original Halo Reach XP and levelling system with \"seasons\" \n     - Can no longer just buy what you want, you need to play 4 million mp matches just to \n       unlock the helmet you want then repeat that for the matching chest piece in the next \n       season\n     - Can no longer get experience from the campaign (Edit: This has since been updated so \n       you can ear medals from campaign but you still can't directly earn xp) \n     - The maximum experience able to be collected is to low for the later levels. I think the max \n        should be lifted fro everyone, or slowly go up depending on what level you are\n- How long it takes to level up is just stupid. It was good for the first few levels then it feels like there is a massive jump in time.\n- A few audio glitches here and then. (For me anyway you need to be facing the sound to hear it, even if its over comms\n\nI love the game and would honestly recommend it but think a few things could be changed in my personal opinion.\n- With almost 300 hours of Destiny 2 (D2) back on Battle.net (the Blizzard launcher), let me give this perspective/advice for new players, specifically with regards for the F2P offering that is Destiny 2: New Light, with a few more holistic thoughts sprinkled throughout:\n\nThis overall game is very good. It doesn't always live up to its promise (the first mission of every campaign is always the most polished thing aside from the raids/dungeons), but when it does, it [b]really[/b] shines.\n\nThe gunplay is unrivaled. The visual/audio feedback is great, the handling feels really good, and enemies really pop when you take them out. Expect nothing less from the studio that brought us grunt birthday parties.\n\nThe game is better in a fireteam. Now that the base game is F2P [though with considerably less content than it used to be/I would like], this should be easier than ever for most activities. That said, a huge majority of my playtime was done solo. It can get tricky at times (\"Darkness Zones\" in certain missions prevent respawning but allow for revives, so solo players have a distinct disadvantage there). \n\nWith that said, dungeons (currently 'The Shattered Throne', 'Pit of Heresy', 'Prophecy' which is free to all players, 'Grasp of Avarice', 'Duality', and 'Spire of the Watcher') and raids (\"Last Wish\" from Forsaken, \"Garden of Salvation\" from Shadowkeep, \"The Deep Stone Crypt\" from Beyond Light, 'Vow of the Disciple' from Witch Queen, as well as 'Vault of Glass' and 'King's Fall' from D1 - both of which are both free to all players) are best experienced with a team, so don't shy away from LFG group-finder options like the Discord, official app, or any number of other sites (just make sure to accurately describe your experience, level, and gear. 'Tis only polite). \n\nOf the matchmade multiplayer offerings, I enjoy Gambit (PvPvE, reminds me of the Black Ops Zombies 4z4 mode done right), jump into the occasional Strike (PvE, matchmade fireteams running campaign-like missions), and have no interest in Crucible (PvP, it's fine I guess, but I've never liked PvP that's dependent in large part on personal progression - especially in the competitive modes like Trials of Osiris and Iron Banner)\n\nDon't be afraid to ignore content - this is absolutely the kind of game where you can set your own goals. Want a specific exotic gun? Look up where it drops and focus on grinding that content. Want a specific roll on a random roll gun? Find the best possible farming (or crafting) method and go to town. Chase down some of the exotic questions that the game clutters up your quest page with, or just goof around doing things that you find fun while absolutely ignoring all signposts.\n\nSome stuff just won't be explained in game. It's not as bad as Warframe (much less need for a wiki) but some things are still obscured. Feel free to look up Xur (exotic weapon vendor who visits on weekends) and other hidden exotics tied to specific activities, lost sectors, patrol locations, or quest chains.\n\nFor anything that you can't easily find online - reach out and find a sherpa. The community for this game tends to be pretty great, and enough of us have spent enough time leaning specific parts of it (e.g. raids) or just mechanics in general (\"What are random rolls? Which do I keep?\") that we'd be happy to jump onto discord (there are a bunch for PC, just check out the subreddit sidebar linked below) and answer any and all questions you may have. \n\nThe fact that a representative chunk of this game is free makes this the perfect time to dip your toes in without emptying out your wallet. Any other questions about this game as a product (\"Should I pay for DLC? Is Eververse worth it?\") should absolutely be researched elsewhere.\n\nIf you're looking for a place to start with the F2P content, finish the intro missions in the Cosmodrome. New and returning players are semi-regularly upgraded to a new light level floor, but means that you can miss out on the \"learning the ropes\" parts of the game that come with working your way through the New Light quest chain or unlocking different subclasses. [As of Beyond Light, all of the campaign content through Forsaken are not currently accessible. Release order was Red War (launch campaign) > Forsaken > Shadowkeep > Beyond Light > Witch Queen, followed by the upcoming expansions Lightfall > Final Shape.]\n\nEyes up, guardian.\n\nFootnotes for people yelling at me in the comments:\n-All of this is my opinion. Feel free to hold your own and disagree with mine.\n-I generally enjoy grinding, looter shooters, FPS's, and weird sci-fi space magic. Halo, Borderlands, Warframe, and CoD Zombies are some of my most-played and favorite games.\n-As far as I can tell, anything that is not strictly subjective in the above is factually correct [as of Season of Plunder, with updates noted throughout. This game changes quite a bit over time, so make sure to do your own research before spending money on it]. If I've missed something, feel free to point it out in the comments and I'll do my best to update this periodically. \n-This review previously made mention of both content vaulting and weapon sunsetting. These practices have both been discontinued as of Season of Plunder. However, it is not clear at this if or when power capped or vaulted may return/be uncapped, if ever.\n\n-----------------\nTL:DR: It's good. Not perfect, but really good. And since it's free, you can get a really good sense of if this game is for you without paying for any of it. You can play almost any activity solo pretty easily except for a handful of endgame activities. If you're overwhelmed at first, just play through the Cosmodrome missions while you get your feet under you, or ask a veteran player for help.\n-----------------\n\nSites to use (List was compiled at Shadowkeep launch, but most of it should still be relevant/useful)\n\n    \nBeginner's Guide (Current as of Beyond Light) - https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/49007\n\nThe DTG Subreddit - /r/DestinyTheGame on Reddit - https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/\n\nDestiny Item Manager (mange your inventory from your browser even while in-game, essential to avoid unneeded trips back to the tower) - app.destinyitemmanager.com\n\nDestiny 2 Checklist (Lists out everything to do as well as when it resets in-game) - www.d2checklist.com/\n\nLight gg (Database of in-game items, useful for looking up random rolls) - https://www.light.gg/\n\nBraytech org (Lots of overlapping features, but I really like their maps) - braytech.org/\n\nDatto (Destiny Youtuber / 24:02 Raider who posts lots of useful/educational content, including exotic guides) - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkmAjbIecTIjTQctolYeuDw\n\nIf you've played D2 on another system, check out the CrossSave page (https://www.bungie.net/7/en/crosssave) on the Bungie net official site respectively to get all of your content and progression moved over to Steam.\n\nStory Recap up through Shadowkeep (Spoilers Destiny 1 / D1, and D2, obviously) (My name is Byf on YouTube: The Complete Story of Destiny!

This is definitely one of the best narrative driven RPG maker games ever made - it has everything you could want.  It has beautiful art, beautiful music, wonderful narration, it's atmospheric, great characters, meaningful choices, a story of overcoming hardships similar to a real life instead of just a story, and the ending I got was beautiful! I have only played the game once but the game has a lot of different branching paths with choices really making a large difference in the game.  This game will always have a special place in my heart.\n- This is such a faithful recreation of Star Ocean 2, I don't think I'll ever even consider playing the PS1 original, or the PSP remake. The beauty of the new HD landscapes and animations, added to the wonderful musical score, the various combat improvements and the classic story, this is one you won't soon forget.\n\n20 hours to beat\n2 main characters to see the story from different perspectives\n13 recruitable party members\na MASSIVE world to explore\nintense crafting system\nStorytelling as only the japanese could tell in the 90's\n\n100% recommend.\n- I even set a calendar reminder so that I could get this on release. I wish I hadn't bothered. Going great guns until I got to the passage. Game over as I can't progress. Tried allsorts to drop the jammer but unable to do so. I guess it is a case of waiting for all the bugs to get resolved.\n- I got this game for $12 off humble bundle. Me and my friends play it for hours on end. This game honestly feels like the perfect fighting game for me because there is no set style. I don't have to remember specific combos or any crazy inputs. It's just simplicity. Unless you want to do that in which you can. But it's fun for anyone. If I were you I would get it off of humble bundle for $12.\n- It looked old when it was released. Now it's downright ugly. The gunplay is clunky. The physics are terrible. The bugs are ever present.\n\nThe RPG mechanics are top notch. The choices you make matter.\n\nOne of the greatest games ever made.\n- They need to add more weapons like a galil or m249 or something and maybe more vehicles and playmodes.But overall so many possibilities\n- Game slaps, played the first area, unlocked ranked and spent 4 hours grinding a 2 minuet long level to reach the top rank in bronze 1 division and i'm going to do it again tomorrow\n- I read the negative reviews and backlash against DoubleFine, but I thought that I would be OK even if the game had some bugs and wasn't quite finished, so I picked it up anyway. That was a mistake.\n\nThe game is not just unfinished, its in an Alpha state. Which is sad, because I definetly would enjoy the game if it was done. As it is, the game is entertaining for a couple hours, then quickly grows tiresome and frustrating. The bugs are not crippling, but taken as a whole they represent a game that is very unbalanced and grates on you over time. \n\nIf DF-9 ever hits the $5 pile, pick it up. otherwise pass.\n- Only originally bought this to support the artist, since I'm a huge fan of his pixel art work. It's amazing, and there's a tonne of eye candy to fill your eyeballs with. However, I can't recommend this to everyone as after the first few hours it's become a bit of a chore.\n\n- The game is a \"clicker\" type with rpg/upgrade elements. It's too slow to play in the background/absent mindedly but not fast enough to keep your attention fully.\n- Each round/attempt at a boss takes way too goddamn long. \n- Barely any interaction with the world. You build tower defense style, and equip new items, but beyond that you don't have any special abilities, no \"oh shit\" once per loop power, no ability to target specific enemies, nothing. Just watch everything play out and hope your little guy doesn't get pulped.\n- Crafting/Supplying is sort of hidden away and if you don't know about dismantling you'll never grind out all the items you need to build new stuff.\n- Lore/Journal entries are hidden away and require resources to unlock using a little button on the bottom of the screen that's easy to miss. I only found it 20 hours in. The writing is cringey and obviously done by someone who probably enjoys Adam Sandler films.\n- The card system is a neat idea, but jesus christ there's too much garbage shuffling. Imagine playing MtG with a deck of 100 cards and 90 of them are lands, and everytime you get a new hand you reshuffle the whole deck so all you get is more lands. Oblivion (destroys a tile) rarely, if ever, pops up. \n- Character skills are kinda bad? You might get a good one every level (which again, takes forever) but half the time it'll be useless \"leave 10% of food/resources at camp\" when you're not doing a resource grind run.\n- So much trash equipment you have to sort through and breaks game flow.\n\nAnd the biggest \"don't recommend\" from me would be the issue with how combining tiles works. If you put two tiles beside each other they sometimes change the tiles to something else. Example - put a Vampire Mansion beside a Village and you get a town full of ghouls that after 3 loops around the map turns into an upgraded town. But you still get trash equipment from the quests it gives, and putting a Vampire Mansion beside any other type of town doesn't change that town at all. So there's no reason to experiment, and it really limits the gameplay. You'd think they'd focus on that aspect gameplay wise, especially with experimentation to get the most bonuses out of all your tiles... but no. There's a small list of things that interact with each other, and that's it.\n\nI still highly recommend it since the game is cheap, the art is amazing and the artist/indie devs should get support. But I think it's a good 2-3 major updates, expansions or fan modding away from getting really, really amazing.\n- The Steam trailer really doesn't do this game justice.\n\nIts extremely early access right now, and the gameplay itself is nothing too spectacular (yet), but the super dynamic proximity chat is what really makes this game for me.\nHearing the muffled screams of someone getting choked out by a bug, followed shortly after by the panicked wails of another crewmember running for the life, is likely one of the funniest things I have ever experienced in a video game.\nIt truly is such a simple, yet infinitely expandable mechanic that I am really exited to see build upon in the future.\n\nPERSONAL IDEA IF THE DEVS READ THIS REVIEW:\nA monster that picks a target to stalk and follow silently. While stalking, the monster records whatever its target says, then, after it has stalked enough and kills it target, it turns from a hunter to an ambush predator. Staying stationary in the dark and playing the recorded sounds of its now dead target in order to lure in their friends.\nImagine hearing your friend, rounding the corner, and realizing that your friend is already long dead...\n- Refunded.\n\nFeels like they released the wrong game files - half the game seems to be broken or missing...\nBasic functions such as zooming in and out, no tutorial, huge amounts of buttons that don't have any impact. Good idea, terrible execution.\n- This is everything a remaster is supposed to be. You remember playing this game over a decade ago, and the graphics weren't \"that bad\". But nostalgia is a cruel mistress. You play the original again, and you can barely stand it.\n\nThe comes the HD version, which was alright, playable. But then, the real remaster, the Definitive Edition, you start playing the game and it FEELS like it used to feel. Like it is supposed to look. It is quite obviously way better than it used to be, but it FEELS the same.\n\nIf you ever liked playing this game, and want to play it again, this won't disappoint you. Especially with the distinct lack of RTS games in the last decade or so, this still holds true as one of the best ones.\n- Playing this game for the first time six years after its initial release proved to be a delight in disguise. With all the memes and jokes established, I was finally able to understand what the fuss was all about back in 2011. Despite not having the best gameplay, story or graphics out there, something about this title just made me want to finish every quest I deemed worth completing. \n\n9/10 - mods recommended\n- it's a shame but i honestly cannot recommend this game if you are a disabled person, i wasn't that far into the game when my character started panicking apon seeing a disabled person [person with leg braces] and then gets a \"no good answer\" bit of dialog and all the options are saying something wrong or saying nothing, trying to go with the least bad option aside from saying nothing since i know as a disabled person myself [i'm a wheelchair user] it can be pretty upsetting getting people just randomly stare at me and at least when they say something slightly wrong they are engaging with me as a person, my character then proceeds to talk abt what an \"inspiration\" it is 2 c a disabled person living their life,,, not exaggerating when i say i let my head hit the desk, closed the game and uninstalled, i understand that this is probably put in the game to be a teachable moment for the able bodied audience but ironically in trying to educate about us disabled people they then made the assumption that no disabled people would be playing their game as there is no option to make your character disabled or even to make them remotely aware of disability and ended up just making the experience awful for the disabled gamers they seem to be trying to help\n- No additional account, no unnecessary launcher, no denuvo, no epic exclusivity, no microtransactions, just a video game as it always should be..\n- Even with over 500 years difference between us, Andreas is one of the most relatable characters I've played this year because I too would rather try to ineffectively solve random mysteries than directly confront my depression.\n- I left home with nothing but a needle and my granny's briefcase full o' snakes, hitched a ride to Boring Springs, killed two men and three snakes, learned to speak Goblin, and befriended a woman whose home was burned to the ground by a gang of cows. Then I bought a horse and left the tutorial area, and things got weird. I'm pretty on board with this one.\n- tl;dr: if you're looking for \"Terraria in space\", buy Starbound. Don't waste 88 hours of your life like I did trying to find the game in this steaming pile of crap.\n\nIt's like Starbound or Terraria! Except without any of the diversity or fun discoveries that make Starbound and Terraria great.\n\nNow including:\n-Terrible devs that clearly abandoned ship years ago\n-Ugly, generic spritework that lacks any of the rough-cut charisma that other pixel art games usually have\n-Weapons that all feel the same\n-Confusing progression\n-Very plain biomes that look the same no matter where you go (The lower biomes aren't any better. They're basically the same thing in a different color.)\n-Indescipherable UI (with no map, by the way.)\n-Stupid glitches abound\n\nThe only credit I can give it is that it's a program that exists and can be run by my computer.\n1/10.\n- When 'Papers, Please' goes online. The game is similar. You make a judgement on the item based on the state regulation and/or some task given to you. The game is really in early stage but foundation of game mechanic is already laid and can be expanded for more challenge. \n\nThe US$5 & under price tag is fair enough for this early game. I already have the gameplay videos uploaded, you guys make a choice to buy or not. I wish I could choose 'neither' recommend this game, the game is not bad or good for me given its current version.\n\nPlaylist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2dyX3SxPgukmvyL31uQNpfXtaeVXNV3R\n\nEDIT1: Decided to change this to \"not recommended\" due to uncertain future development of this game.\n- EDIT:\nRobot Entertainment has decided to dump Gameforge as the EU publisher and publish the game themselves. I would like to applaud their decision. Better late (in this case quite late) than never. However, I will not change this review to recommended for the simple fact that they shouldn't have selected that publisher in the first place. This is what ultimately ruined the EU version of the game, and it should be a good example to any other developers who consider Gameforge as their publisher (although more are more developers are duming Gameforge nowadays). I am not going to edit any of the details below since I haven't played the game after I wrote the original review, but I will most certainly consider returning to the game after the migration of the servers is complete.\n\nHere's the original review:\nPart 1:\nHow To Kill A Potentially Good Game (For Dummies):\n- Make a potentially good game.\n- Give the publishing rights to Gameforge.\n- Done!\n\nI mean, let's take a look at some of the games that Gameforge ruined:\n- Aion EU (utterly dead)\n- Tera EU (completely dead)\n- Soldier Front 2 EU (a.k.a. \"S.K.I.L.L., although the only skill you need for that game is a wallet)\n- Raiderz EU (shut down)\n- Mythos (shut down)\n- Katsuro: Path of Honor (shut down)\n- Hellbreed (shut down)\n... the list goes on ...\n\nWhy would ANYONE in their right mind allow Gameforge to publish their game?! Gameforge is known as the WORST European publisher. No one does business with them anymore and they're close to filing for bankruptcy. They already closed their location in Berlin. Why would you do that, Robot Entertainment?\n\nIt could have been a great game...\n\nPart 2:\nSince some lovely folks commented that they would REALLY (real-time executive realness) want me to review the game itself, and not its publisher, here you go:\n\nPros:\n- Great voice acting. The way they went with it (overly sarcastic) could have ended up being cringy, like the one in Wildstar, but instead, they did a good job with it.\n- Good animations. The game feels like it's polished and well executed.\n- Short queues and loading screens.\n- Interesting tower defence gameplay (as far as the Survival mode goes).\n- Character development and a crafting system.\n- Runs great on a high-end laptop.\n\nCons:\n- Poorly optimized for computers that are supposed to be able to run the game on its minimal settings.\n- Gets quite repetitive quite fast.\n- Grinding for materials can be tedious.\n- The Siege mode needs a lot of work. It is nowhere near as polished as the Survival mode.\n- The Survival mode can be too short at the early levels.\n- The developer decided to give the game to the worst publisher in Europe, and probably even the world. I mean, even EA isn't that bad anymore. I guess Gameforge could compete against Webzen for the first place.\n- You are able to buy almost everything with real cash, and if you don't want to, you better prepare for a long grind.\n- Did I mention how stupid the decision to give the publishing rights to Gameforge was? I think I did, but oh well...\n- The game is basically a cash shop oriented version of OMD! 2.\n\nThere you go! You're welcome.\n\nP.S.: Needless to say, I won't be spending a dime on this game, as long as Failforge gets a cut. I encourage everyone to do the same. Robot Entertainment might get their heads out of their... (you got the point) and change the publisher before it's too late for the game.\n- Started strong, ended annoyingly.\n\nMoral of the story? People don't matter, relationships don't matter, just do what you want and never compromise because that thing you haven't done since you were a kid is totally going to work out as a new career.\n\nIt paints a rather unhealthy picture of relationships - that \"routine\" is somehow negative - stagnant- rather than safe and stable and a foundation to grow something new on. That arguments should be allowed to blow up relationships, and are not simply things that you need to work on as a couple.\n\nI liked the art, liked the music, liked the plot until the final 3 or 4 chapters. But it all fell apart and tries to teach a very vapid moral that someone in their early 20's who has never had a meaningful relationship would idealize.\n\nAt least it was short.\n\n- I was excited to play this after playing Persona 5 and Persona 5 Royal (my introductions to the series) to death.  This game was raved about and I thought, if it's more of the same then this should be great...\n\nThe major problem I have with this game is that it's so painfully obvious that it's a game made 13 years ago.  It's not a bad game, the look and feel of the Persona series is there and the characters are interesting etc.  But at the same time whenever I played this game, I just wanted to go back and play P5R instead.  Everything is just better in P5R.  The dungeons for example, the difference is night and day.  P5R's dungeons have so much more life to them, and look so much better.  Most of the environments in this game look like dull coloured LEGO sets put together.  It looks like it was originally on a handheld console (despite the remaster).  The other major example is the voice acting.  My god, some of the voice acting in 4G is on par with some of the worst Square Enix efforts.  Audio balancing is terrible as well.  And then there's the subjective stuff.  I personally much prefer P5R's soundtrack over this one, aside from maybe a couple of songs that were cool.  The setting of Tokyo is much more interesting and dynamic than this hokey town in the middle of nowhere.  The characters themselves I found much more engaging in 5R.  This was particularly helped by the quality of voice acting.  I think \n\nI'm glad that people are able to experience this game again on a more available platform.  I think potentially if I had played this back when it was released, I would probably have a different opinion of this game.  If you like Persona games and can look beyond what's dated badly, then the core game is very much the same.  If you were a fan already, this is a quality refresh to the game.  However, if you're like me and experienced the future of this series before playing this, I dont recommend it.  P5R provides the same gameplay but adds so much more.  It's a shame we cannot get that game on Steam instead.\n- owned the original from all the way back in 2014\nloved it tons, even more than RoR2\nsaw RoRR get teased on twitter, was there for its release, thought to myself,\n\"i don't need this, i can just play the ror from 2013, i don't know how to feel about this new one, is it really just the same game again?\"\n\nand then i saw someone grab an item i've never seen before, while playing as a character i've never seen before, on a map layout i've never seen before, using alternate abilities to what was baseline for that character to fight an enemy i've never seen before, and then activate a shrine of the mountain from ror2, and then while doing the teleporter fight they activated a bunch of new machines that turned drones into items and activated a specific equipment for a fee... and then i saw that you can just opt out of whatever you don't like about any of that, at any time!\n\nwhat's not to love about that??\n- I'm not a fan of visual novels.  I hate pixel graphics.  I played all games by these guys and wept like a baby every single time.  More than every single time.  This time, even more than more.  What a masterpiece\n- It's good if you don't mind clicking a lot and getting horse droppings for chest rewards after matches. Literal garbage rewards mostly. Beautiful game though, lots of violence, love the ranged combat.\n- Firstly, neutral reviews should be a thing. Because although the game's story is pretty solid (and some elements of it still very relavant even today), the game suffers from a multitude of issues, so no, I don't truly recommend this game because of those factors. Rockstar themselves should be fixing the broken state of the game, instead of leaving it to people to fix it.\n\nThe problem with this game is that you need to be online to be even able to play it. You NEED to be online to PLAY a SINGLEPLAYER game FROM 2009. I don't know what Rockstar was thinking when they force you to play online, but this is just not okay. There is no online functionality for the game besides maybe cloud saves - something steam cloud could've done just as fine instead of leaving it to their own messy launcher.\n\nBut that's not the only problem with this game. Being that it's an old game, it does not run well on modern systems, not anymore. It suffers from various performance issues. Thankfully, you can use DXVK to get around this problem - but as i said earlier, you shouldnt HAVE TO do this. Rockstar could have easily patched the game to fix the performance issues (that still happen with DXVK mind you - but compared to without DXVK it is MUCH better), instead they focused on patching who knows what.\n\nExcept after you use DXVK, you HAVE to edit a game file to let the game use more than 2 gb of ram. Again, SOMETHING Rockstar could've easily done by updating the game's code to meet the modern standards. Nobody has specs like the one in the minimum recommend anymore. After you do that, you HAVE to edit the amount of vram the game detects by using a command line to fix it. That's already 3 things you have to deal with JUST to be even able to play the game normally.\n\nSome people may see this as a small botherance - some people may see it as a huge inconvenience, but the apparent problem with this is that, once again, you SHOULDNT HAVE TO do all of this. Going past those issues and playing the game, you also have to ensure you limit the fps to 60, either using DXVK or the in game vsync (former being more recommendable as it doesn't hog as much as cpu power). If you decided to bother with all of those steps to make the game playable, congratulations. Now be severely annoyed like I did  because Rockstar has not, for all this time, patched the final mission with the helicopter QTE. One suggested fix for it was to limit the FPS to 60 - which did NOT help me. Other was to install a script file to fix it, which ALSO failed at first, till I tried again like 5-6 times. You as a player should not have to install this stuff and edit games just to fix the game, when the publisher themselves should be doing it. I expect a game to be supported if it's still being sold on Steam. And don't think they don't care about the games being on Steam - they clearly cared when they removed the classic gta trilogy from Steam (which were also left in even more of a broken state compared to how they first came out - but that is an entirely different point).\n\nPutting all of those factors aside, the game itself is very solid, story wise. I really loved all of the symbolism that was apparent throught the game, and concepts such as \"American Dream\" or \"Land of Oppurtunity\" being presented as something that was clearly flawed - which is precisely why people like Nico go down the path of killing people or doing drugs just to survive. You can't go from rags to riches in a \"strong eat the weak\" country - you either do whatever it is you have to do - like Nico - to survive, or you let yourself and your close ones get killed. There are other things the game criticizes as well, like that one conversation where Nico criticizes the food in the city for using \"chemicals that your body spends time getting it off your system\", or something along those lines. I don't think I need to mention that this isn't something they added as a joke, because it is very much there. The game's serious and dark tone might be considered bad by people, but it is because of this dark tone and seriousness that we can actually learn some lessons from it and open our eyes to some truths in our lives.\n\nThe gameplay itself isn't really that complicated, except when it comes to driving the vehicles in the game. They are based on a realistic driving system and although it is debatable how much of a good gaming experience it really is when they made it so realistic, since it introduces a huge learning curve and can end up frustrating the player, I actually ended up loving it for what it is, except when it came to driving motorcycles of any form. The game's simplicity in other regards is what makes it pretty good, in my eyes. Though it sometimes doesn't work the way you think it would (like when you are playing with a controller and have to use auto aim), it is nevertheless solid enough that those are only minor inconveniences and not the kind of problem where you'd want to stop playing the game.\n\nThis game definitely deserves more attention and love - but Rockstar really needs to fix this game themselves if they are still keeping it on Steam's store, because the current situation of the game is not acceptable.\n\n\n- Minesweeper influenced design feels like a fresh take on the Slay-the-Spire-like genre.  Now that I've won with all six classes, and done some of the unlockable difficulty levels, I feel that I've gotten my money's worth with the game, and I have enjoyed the time I've spent so far, but I don't expect great longevity beyond this point.\n\nI do have some minor gripes:\n\n* The pacing on unlocking new classes feels too slow.  It would be nice if the approach was the fairly standard one of unlocking a new class when you win with the previous one, but here there is a currency which is acquired throughout runs, and I found that I usually had to have two winning runs with the previous class to earn enough currency to unlock a new one.\n* Optimal play with some classes requires memorizing tiles which are revealed, and then on later turns these tiles are hidden.  Taking damage because I misremembered what was hidden behind a tile feels unfun and at-odds with what the game otherwise wants to be.\n* I would prefer if the harder difficulty settings were unlocked from the get-go, rather than grinding through easier difficulty settings to find the challenge.\n\nOtherwise, though, it's a fun game with an adorable art style, and not just a clone of the other Spire-likes around.  Recommended if your expectation is to get ten hours or so of strategic puzzling.\n- [h1]Dishonored 2.[/h1]\n[i]If old Samuel could see me now...[/i]\n\n[b][u]Introduction[/u][/b]\nAt its core, Dishonored 2 is little more than a mechanically and narratively contiguous continuation of the Dishonored formula. This isn't a bad thing - the first Dishonored was one of the best stealth-action games of all time - but innovation is too often overlooked in the games industry. DH2 does bring some nuance to the franchise, but new drawbacks are packaged in as well. Put plainly, Dishonored 2 is a game I adore just as much as the original, but there are aspects that certainly left me wishing for better.\n\n[b][u]Plot[/u][/b]\nThe game begins 15 years following Empress Jessamine's assassination, and her daughter, Empress Emily Kaldwin, has ruled the isles since that time. Her father and Lord Protector, Corvo Attano, advises and keeps close watch over her at court. Quickly after Dishonored 2's opening however, the Duke of Serkonos, Luca Abele, comes to Emily's royal tower - bearing a gift. He brings Emily's supposed long lost aunt, Delilah Kaldwin, who then immediately stages a coup in a bid to take the throne. She is successful, and you must escape the city of Dunwall as either Emily or Corvo (more on that later). You then travel to Karnaca, the capital of Serkonos, where you begin a personal crusade to [i]take back what's yours.[/i]\n\n[b][u]Technical Revamp[/u][/b]\nShifting focus for a look at DH2's presentation, the game is gorgeous. There's a hint of the old, comic-book-like aesthetic that was present in the original game, but the graphical fidelity has been greatly improved in this sequel. The textures, lighting, animations, visual effects, and environments are all elegantly rendered. It's easily one of the most beautiful games of 2016. As for the audio; sound effects and voices are realistic, and the OST is as iconic, if not more so than the first game's. Although, when it comes to performance, Dishonored 2 clearly falters. DH2 was a technical mess on launch, and while it runs decently now; some bugs, stutters, and crashes still persist. Overall the presentation is good, but the performance is surely sub-par.\n\n[b][u]Setting & Exploration[/u][/b]\nAs stated earlier, Dishonored 2 is set in Serkonos's city of Karnaca; known as The Jewel of the South. Gone are the dark grays and subdued browns of Dunwall, as Karnaca replaces them with bright, pastel blues and yellows. The metropolis has distinct cultural differences from Dunwall as well, whether it's the widespread use of wind-power over whale oil, or Karnaca's reliance on silver mining to employ its working class. In terms of level design, DH2's stages are much more expansive than anything seen in the first game too. There's lots to explore in every district of Karnaca, especially when verticality and hidden locations are taken into account. There's several routes toward all objectives as well; emphasizing Arkane's \"play your way\" motto. All considered, Dishonored 2's game world is exceedingly well-built.\n\n[b][u]Depth in the Details[/u][/b]\nOne of the most effective ways DH2 differentiates itself from its predecessors is through what I'd call 'structural gimmicks.' To break up the standard pacing, a couple of the game's missions have special set-pieces which can completely turn gameplay convention on its head. An example of this is the 'Clockwork Mansion' on the fourth level. This inventor's home has levers in essentially every chamber that reconfigures a room's layout - such as turning a trophy room into a grand hall. These levers can be used to access new areas or evade enemies, and even reveal traversable spaces behind the walls. It's this degree of imaginative design depth that distinguishes Dishonored 2 from most other games in its genre.\n\n[b][u]Stealth & Combat[/u][/b]\nMoving over to the core gameplay loop, not much has changed from the first game. The stealth and combat are still just as exquisitely implemented as before, with only a couple of refinements. The deviations that come to mind are that drop-assassinations can now be used non-lethally as drop-knockouts, and assassination animations are a much more brutal (but cathartic) spectacle to watch than before. Dishonored 2's central mechanics are near flawless to be sure, but this sequel suffers by adding few new gameplay elements to the mix. Except - well - there is one big feature I've neglected to elaborate on as of yet.\n\n[b][u]Emily [i]or[/i] Corvo[/u][/b]\nIn Dishonored 2, you can play as either Emily Kaldwin, [i]or[/i] Corvo Attano. When Delilah first takes the throne you get a moment to choose one or the other, after which the character you don't pick is turned into a cold, stone statue. Both Emily and Corvo have separate voice actors and personalities, but they share the same goal throughout the game's duration: to save the last of their family, and reclaim the throne for the true Kaldwin heiress. After receiving the mark of The Outsider, Emily and Corvo have different magical abilities too. Where Corvo has blink, Emily has far reach; or where Corvo can stop time, Emily can chain together the lives of her enemies, and kill or incapacitate several people at once. All in all, the decision to allow the player to progress the campaign as either Emily or Corvo was a stroke of brilliance in my estimation.\n\n[b][u]Main Story[/u][/b]\nReturning to the main story - it's another point of criticism for me. There are some magnificent aspects; such as the nostalgic callbacks to events in the first Dishonored or reappearances of some of the original game's best characters, but all considered most of the writing is retreading a beaten path. Just as in Dishonored 1, the game flows from mission to mission where the chief objective is simply to eliminate a key player obstructing your path to the throne. This is perfectly fine from a gameplay perspective, but it can lead to a bit of déjà vu from a narrative outlook. Dishonored 2's writing quality isn't poor, but it doesn't distance itself from the comfortable story-staging of its predecessor, making it feel slightly lazy.\n\n[b][u]A Reactive World[/u][/b]\nOn the other side of the same coin, the narrative reactivity of Dishonored 2's world to your choices is truly admirable. Playing DH2 in high chaos; where you murder many people throughout the game, results in huge environmental storytelling changes compared to low chaos. Here's an example. If you flood the streets of Karnaca red with blood, subsequent levels show you've harmed the city's inhabitants before you even arrive. Citizens’ moods and perceptions will have soured as they become depressed or monstrous in the wake of their crumbling city - causing suicides and murders to spike throughout Karnaca. And corpses bring bloodflies, which further tarnishes The Jewel of the South in a vicious cycle. You can, of course, avoid all this... by showing a whole lot of care in your actions toward others.\n\n[b][u]Conclusion[/u][/b]\nWhen all is said and done, the Dishonored formula is a fantastic one that it's hard to not have fun with. Karnaca is riddled with environmental detail, the stealth mechanics are flawless, combat is devilishly enjoyable, and the game judges you intelligently on your choices. The Dishonored IP is incredibly strong... The tweaks provided are appreciable; I just wish DH2 had made a concerted effort to make it even stronger. But, god-dammit, I enjoyed Dishonored 2 way too much over it's 20+ hour campaign to critique it any longer. Get the game and play it - despite all my pissy complaints, you won't be disappointed.\n\n[h1]Personal Rating: 9/10 - Absolutely Outstanding[/h1]\n- As a cybersecurity professional , I would classify this game as malware, or at the least adware.\nWhy? It opens up a number, at least 10 when I checked, of connections to various points on the internet which have no purpose in running the game. They are only there so the vendor can spam you with advertising, track you, or for other unspecified activities. \nAs such, I can NOT recommend this game. \n\nTo verify, I disconnected my computer from the internet. The game ran fine without the advertising and tracking. \nThen I connected back to the internet, and launched the game. The game opened at least 10 connections(!).\nThen, while still connected to the internet, I blocked the game's network-connecting executables in the firewall. In such a case, the game behaves differently, apparently it sees there is an active connection so it runs for a while, then when it cannot make it's for-bad-purposes network connections, it terminates and you can't play. \nThis is bad behavior that I would only expect from spyware and malware. I hope the vendor fixes it so the software runs in the manner they declare - it is supposed to not require network connectivity after the initial run as they describe in the System Requirements. \nSteam should be reigning in this behavior as well.\n- Before I begin, are you a fan of modern art? If no, I can safely say move on, this isn't the game for you. If yes, then you can appreciate that there is a lot of famous modern art. Some pieces you will find yourself drawn to and feel something about them, and others won't evoke any real response. This is true for most things in life, but we tend to try and find reasons why we feel a certain way about other mediums, while with art we are usually happy enough to admit the various factors like skill, materials used etc. don't really impact our overall opinion of the piece.\n\nKentucky Route Zero is an incredibly well made and obviously incredibly personal game, and the level of effort put into it is astonishing, and I didn't like it. I wish I liked it, it seems so much like something I should like, but I don't. The strangest thing is, I would call this the game's greatest triumph. \"Games as Art\" has been an ongoing debate for years, but artist's always make something for themselves, while most games are made to be enjoyed. The fact that I didn't like this but I can't actually pinpoint the reason is evidence that this might be something more than most other games in this space.\n\nI won't go on too much longer here because while I cannot recommend something I didn't enjoy, I do absolutely think anyone interested in narrative games try the first two acts. I did enjoy the first act and can recommend that with no reservations, but from the second act onwards my interest and patience just declined more and more. I have no problem with wordy games, I've played plenty of visual novels that took 50+ hours to complete, but here I feel more and more of the story was being told with blanks I was supposed to fill in, but I just wasn't engaged enough with the characters and setting to bother with that, so you can easily see how this would become more frustrating over time.\n\nI wouldn't change a thing about this game, to me that would be like asking a painter to add in a few more trees to a finished piece. This game exists as a piece of art. I didn't like it, but you might love it, and you might not be able say why either, and that's a big achievement.\n- Steam, for gods sake, give us a neutral recommendation button.\n\nSooo, long story short, the game is nice and has beautifull artwork. It´s also massivly too short. This are the only objective things I can say about it. \n\nNow to be a bit more real here. I bought this game, because I played another game like this, let´s call it \"Blue Sticks Bar\". And that game hooked me into this genre.\nNormally I´m someone who likes extensive interaction with a Games Story more than anything else. For this reason I hated TTG and similar stuff. But that Barkeeping game had such a complex Story and such good Characters that I fell in love with it and by extension the Genre.\n\nSo I got myself Coffee Talk. And boy oh boy let me tell ya, I´m seriously torn with this game. Partway through I thought I would give it a searing bad review. But then I played through it and noticed something. This game isn´t bad, just painfully average. And, I hate to say this, but I´m probably too mature for it.\n\nNow don´t get me wrong.\nSome things here are just wonderfull. The Artstyle? Fantastic (exept for a couple minor things)\nI´m guessing the music is also good if you like it.\n\nBut already there are cracks there. Something (mildly) dramatic is happening and some coffee house tunes are playing in the Background. It´s honestly just laughable.\nAnd that word is a great segway into talking about the Story. You know that moment when you´re browsing and find (mostly on Tumblr) some really cute little story idea? This is that the game. Problem is, that a Story that deals with, for example racism, growing up, PTSD and some other really serious matters can´t be as shallow as this.\n\nYou have to decide. Either you´re doing Babies first social awareness Storyline and leave out some of this stuff, OR you do a real mature story that I can´t sum up in one single sentence.\n\nI really want to like this Game. I´m a lonely little Geek, so a Story about interesting People in a Shadowrun-light Setting sounded right up my alley. But it was simply too dissappointing. \n\nI wouldn´t refund this game even if I could, since it had some good stuff in it. \nBut sadly I can´t recommend it.\n\n\nWow, I got through this all without swearing, nice one!\n- \"Do not ask, 'Is Pizza Tower worth my time?' Instead ask, 'Am I worth Pizza Tower's time?'\"\nSun Tzu- Art of War\n- Their last privacy agreement update (January 1st, 2021) states they will \"sell\" users information, including name, email and billing address to third party companies (including social media and advertising). There is no other way of playing the game without accepting those terms, very sad practices for a paid game really.\n- If I could get my money back, I would. AI as usual is hot garbage, cant even take turns without getting LITERALLY BODIED by the AI drivers. The new progression system really sucks. Cool that they wanted to try something different, but I really dont feel like leveling every god damn car in the game just to modify it. If you wanted multiple of same car you would have to level those duplicate cars you purchase. My experience with the physics is just... eh. I mean I sure do love loosing grip just from barely tapping the gas. Constantly fighting my wheel just to stay stable. Driving its probably fine for controller players, I wouldnt on wheel. Credits are only used to buy cars now. Also kinda runs like crap. All i wanted was a Gran Turismo on PC and this... this is not it. Game is mid, move on me thinks.\n\nEdit: I put in a request for a refund and Valve did indeed approve it. I thought I was over the time limit for sure. Don't be me and spend 100 USD for early access. Thanks Valve, you're the best!\n- For the past 4 years I couldn't get myself to finish a single game without having to force myself to do it(and even then I failed). I couldn't enjoy SP games no matter how good the gameplay or the story was. I kept buying games hoping to find that one game that would do the trick. This was FF XV for me. Despite of all my friends advising me against buying it because it was just going to be another game that would sit around in my library, I decided to give it a try.\n\nIt actually felt like I went back in time to when I could play SP games for hours without getting bored after an hour or two.\n\nI admit I skipped most sidequests and I'll try going back to them sooner or later, although it may not be the best game out there in terms of content(you can finish the game on easy skipping most secondary quests in about 20-25 hours) or story development, playing through it felt like a new experience. In fact, even after finishing the game there's still plenty of things to do and in my opinion, even playing it through again just to spend more time with Noctis and his friends is worth it.\n\nThe story is not mindblowing, the combat system is really fun but far from flawless, most sidequests aren't well written but at its core, at least for me, FF XV has something to it that other games lack. I can't say it magically restored my old passion for gaming but it has given me a reason to at least try to get into it again.\n\nIf you haven't played it yet I sincerely envy you, I would love to experience it all over again from the start, it has been a memorable journey to say the least and I hope that you are willing to give it a try. ^^\n- Falcom's Action RPG Masterpiece.\n\nbest story in the series. it follows the latest adventure of Adol and his companions, stranded in an island and slowly uncovering their secrets. the tight, but well developed cast are absolutely the best written characters in the series. from party member to your fellow castaways all have developed motivation, personality and charm. \n\nalot of the horribad translation and voice acting have been fixed, and it finally got the treatment it deserve as a masterpiece. \n\nthe gameplay is an evolution of the modern Ys game. at its core, ys 8 is an action RPG where you control adol and several other party members with unique set of skills, moveset, weapons and super attack. each character represent an attack type (slash, pierce, smash) that are pitted against various enemies with certain weaknesses. great variety of enemies, amazing boss battles, music and story. \n\non release, there seems to be a big problem for the port, but as far as i know, everything has been patched to very good level of stability. over 70 hours, the game crashed twice (and saved by the intuitive autosave system), run flawlessly 60 FPS and 1440p without a single slowdown. \n\n10/10 game go buy so we get monstrum nox on PC.\n- It may not be that similar to what most people are familiar with, as a building game, but in most every sense which counts, I believe this is the greatest building game I have ever played.\n\nThe controls are smooth, the Building Mechanics are smooth, the interplay of cuteness and silliness is so smooth, and Lillian has the cutest face in the known universe.\n\nTruly a fantastic game with enjoyable and concise mechanics, the Block Grid is as malleable as Minecraft (except that some areas cannot be mined, usually story quest locations), the ally AI is more involved than Conan (sitting at a table with Rosie to gobble some greens? cute), and the combat is slightly dangerous at first, but mostly very mellow and not in any way detrimental to the building side (the villagers even fix up the damage done to your village in story battles - at least in the 'tutorial' island).\n\nMy only advices:\n\n- If the Camera is too tight on you and too slow to zoom out, switch perspective and back, if that doesn't work, look down at the ground and jump a couple times! (your head will push the camera up into the sky faster)\n\n- Don't get too creative on Furrowfield Farm! I spent a lot of time building and customising, being slightly annoyed at the small build area of the island, but now I discover that the whole thing was essentially a tutorial, and that completing the story missions there opened up the game in a much bigger way. Now I am back on the home Island and am able to build across a much larger area. If you're still in Furrowfield, you basically haven't started the game yet, so get that story done!\n\n- IF YOU SUFFER FROM REGULAR COMPUTER OR PROGRAMME CRASHES:\nWhen loading a Game you can press (A) / (X) on Controller to Copy the Save File and Back it up on one of the other Save Slots. I recommend doing this every day you play in case of  Corrupted Save Data caused by Crashing while Sailing to another Island.\n\nI am tempted to give this game a 9/10 - which is a serious seal of approval from me. Even on my strictest day, I would never give it less than a 7 - it is fun, cute, silly, serious, touching, exciting, and above all else, architexcellent!\n- Classic Mortal Kombat with modern-day graphics & extra mechanics.\nA Fun Educational Game For learning more about the inner workings of the Human Body and Skeletal system.\nfamily friendly pg clean game for children!\n\nHere Is How To Fix The Crashing Problem! \n< Go to your library, click on MKX.\n> Locate the part that says \"DLC\", it should be right below the achievements.\n< You'll see Install pack 1 through 20 something.\n> Select all of them and they will begin to install manually.\n\nhope you enjoy playing.\nGood Luck🌹\n7.5/10\n- So Epic takes over, breaks the game, can't connect to the Epic Services so I can't play, takes away garage items, and then Steam blocks new reviews due to \"off topic\" review activity unless you change the settings manually. Went from a game a played daily to a game I literally can't play. Epic can go blow themselves.\n- WTF, this isn’t gaming! Where are my lootboxes and micro transactions?!\n\nMy main thought after I beat GRIS was, \"I don't really understand anything that just happened, but it sure was pretty.\"\n\nI was absolutely amazed how a game with zero actual dialogue could move me to tears, just on strenght of its visuals and music. In general, the whole theme of dealing with grief/depression spoke to me in a way that I didn't expect.  It's one of those games you play to \"feel\" more than for the gameplay itself.\n\nI have PTSD from dealing with my wife getting a boyfriend, and this game made me cry several times while playing it. Especially during the scene where you're swimming away from the eel. That symbolism to me perfectly captures the feeling of trauma recovery. I'd spent time finding the little lights throughout that section of the game and activating the turtle which ultimately saved me from my own darkness and helplessness.\n\nIt felt like hope. It was such a good representation of how the coping skills I'd learned and the hard work I'd put in were finally seeming to pay off. It's when you're at your weakest that you learn how strong you actually are. I cried like a baby during and after that scene. It made me realize how much I've actually overcome, and how grateful I am to be free.\n\nGris truly is a beautiful game and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a slow paced experience. The only bit of criticism I have for the game is it certainly gives \"not like the other girls\" vibes at times, but I think this is quite easy to get over.\n\nIn conclusion: the visuals are stunning,  the music is beautiful and knows exactly when to kick in, the platforming elements are fantastic, and it’s story and themes are spectacular without a single word. Truly a must-play.\n\n10/10\n- Besides the rocky and terrible launch of this game, then the atrocious \"balance\" changes, now your making a DLC that costs as much as the game? Is it a whole new game? The answer is no, and even if it was, the way you handled this games issues makes me wish I could refund this game and remove your games from showing in my store. I hope no one buys the DLC honestly, I know at least I won't.\n\nIf you want a review of the game, yes, they did seem to iron out most of the issues, however since I haven't played in quite awhile due to me spending too much time apparently gearing my techromancer just to come back and am unable to handle what I could before the \"balancing\", has turned me away from this game. Reducing a classes viability or power in a PVE/CO-OP game boggles my mind. It's like saying, \"Oh you don't like the other classes since they do less damage and are harder to accomplish the same goals? Well let me crush your class into the ground so they all feel the same. Have fun!\"\n- holy fucking shit everything about this fucking mongoloid game is so fucking bad i can't even begin to understand. this was supposed to be better than the first piece of shit, but i dunno, maybe a tiny bit.\n\ndon't be like me and get baited into wasting your hard earned money for this fucking shit even if it's on like -90% sale.\n\nspecial mention to worst fucking controls in the history of fucking gaming. fuck these fucking mongoloid fucking retard faggots for making a game this fucking bad. uninstalled.\n- The game balances out and improves on everything from the original KoF2002. \nThat said, this is a bit more fast-paced than other KoF games. If you've played KoF98, this one is faster and more combo heavy. If you've played 13, this one has a higher bar for executing combos. If you're coming from XI, this one doesn't have the tag system. Those are the most important changes from other popular KoF games.\n- ironic that the best sonic game was the one not made by sonic team\n- Fun JRPG with some action commands thrown in, good variety of enemies, and a pretty decent skill development tree.\n\nEnemies can feel pretty tough later in the game, but its more of a puzzle when trying to complete these fights so it doesn't feel cheap.\n\nGreat soundtrack too.\n\nRuns great on Steamdeck\n- This is like, the End of Evangelion of RPGmaker games.\n- This game taught me about the diversity of cultures that our small little corner of the universe offers.\n\nThen it taught me to hate them all.\n- [b][u] TL;DR[/u] [/b] Finally finish the fight on PC after 13 years.\n[b][u] Long version: [/u] [/b]\n[h1] Halo Combat Evolved Anniversary: [/h1] The very first halo with remastered visuals but the same gameplay. 20 years old now, the level design can sometimes become repetitive. Especially on the library mission. The remastered visuals look nice but I find that it deviates way too much from the original vision of Bungie. You can switch between the old and new graphics with a press of a button. \nOverall a smooth [b][i] Wort out of 10 with a touch of \"this cave is not a natural formation\".[/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Halo 2 Anniversary: [/h1] The second game in the series and the last one for the PC until 15 years later with the release of MCC. The game has remastered visuals as well as fully CGI remastered cutscenes. The remastered visuals are really well done and true to the original artwork and the CGI cutscenes are top notch with quality that can easily surpass the CGI level of some movies. Same gameplay from 15 years ago but it surprisingly holds up pretty well. I did experience some stuttering on this game ever so often but that could just be my system. Again you can switch between the classic and remastered graphics with the press of a button. Even during cutscenes. Just don't shake the light bulb. \nIn summary, I'd give this game a [b][i] Wort Wort Wort out of 10 with a slight slight tinge of heresy. [/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Halo 3: [/h1] The magnum opus of Bungie and the big final conclusion to the halo trilogy. The port to PC was a decent port (well it better be after 13 years!) with little to no technical issues. I faced a desync issue during co-op play on a specific mission until I locked my framerate to 60 fps. I tried to replicate the issue again later on but I had no luck reproducing it. If only were it so easy.\nThe gameplay is similar but sometimes bigger in scale than halo 2 and holds up well. The visuals have not been remastered for halo 3 but they still look good for what they are. \nI give this game a [b][i] Wort in the Wort out of 10. Wake me when you need me. [/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Halo 3 ODST: [/h1] Halo ODST takes place during the events of Halo 2 and follows a squad of Orbital Drop Shock Troppers that get deployed to New Mombasa. It uses the same engine as Halo 3 and so the fidelity isnt much a leap from Halo 3 but the art style is drastically different and takes on a noir style with washed out colors. Kinda reminds me a little bit of Deus ex Human Revolution tbh. Even more so because of its semi open world/hub design.\nThe PC port is as good as Halo 3 if not better and I didn't face any issues. \nThis is a solid [b][i] how many engineers did you murder before dare asked out of 10. [/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Halo Reach: [/h1] Halo Reach would be the final halo game that would be developed by Bungie. Ironically, this game was the first to release for the MCC on PC and is also chronologically the first in the timeline of the main series. Quite frankly the port was not very good. It had audio issues, visual downgrades and many more problems. However in time, 343 has corrected almost all of these issues and now it is a great port to PC. Reach takes place before the events of Halo Combat Evolved and is a prequel to the entire series. It puts you into the shoes of Noble Six, a member of Noble Team that are tasked to... well I wont spoil everything here. Just know that you're stepping into some shoes the rest of the squad would rather leave unfilled. \nThe artstyle is a grittier and more grim depiction of the halo universe and fits well within the narrative of the game. \nThis game gets a [b][i] pair of gúta out of 10 from me. [/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Halo 4: [/h1] After Bungie stepped down as developers of the halo franchise, the mantle was given to 343 industies to carry on the legacy of Halo. The very first game by 343i came in the form of Halo 4 and would be a direct sequel to the conclusion of the Halo trilogy in Halo 3. \nThe change in team came with it, the change in art style, level design and gameplay loop. I will just call this change \"different\". \nThe port to PC is pretty decent aside from some stuttering I faced during coop play. \nOverall this game is a [b][i] 343 out of 10 unless you get on the bad side of Cortana. [/i][/b]\n\n[h1] Multiplayer, Firefight and Spartan Ops: [/h1]\nEach game has its own multiplayer except for Halo 3 ODST. The multiplayer itself is fun and they have enabled cross-play between platforms making finding matches easier.\nThere are so many multiplayer game modes within each game and covering them all is beyond the scope of this short review. :) \nThere are your traditional TDM, Big Team Battle, Capture the flag and such; but there are also interesting and odd game types which are a good change of pace.\nAs for the multiplayer progression, there is a battlepass system in place where you can unlock various cosmetics such as armor parts, gun skins and vehicle skins for each game.\nThe game is updated with seasons that add more features and cosmetics.\nAlthough the idea of a battlepass may put some of us off, the system is completely free and you dont miss out on previous seasons as they are all accessible indefinitely.\nYou can even pick and choose which seasons to progress in.\nIf you want some co-op within multiplayer, then Halo Reach and Halo 3 ODST have a mode called firefight where you have to fend off wave after wave of enemies with changing modifiers or mutations. \nAn alternative to firefight is Spartan Ops, a game mode exclusive to Halo 4. It is a cooperative campaign(you can solo) where you get to use your customised spartan from multiplayer. Keep in mind that although there is a set narrative here, the quality of production in spartan ops is nowhere near the level as that of the main Halo 4 campaign.\n\nOverall the multiplayer, firefight and spartan ops are solid additions to the already superb collection of 6 campaigns. The only thing missing right now is a custom server browser which I believe is in the works. \nEDIT: They have added in a custom server browser for Halo Reach, Halo: Combat Evolved, Halo 2 and Halo 3! :D\n\n[h1] Forge and Theatre: [/h1] \nForge is where you can fool around with various kinds of halo props and items within maps and make your own creations that you can share with others. It has basically endless content.\nJust a cherry on top over all the other content that you are getting with the collection. Forge is available for Halo 2 anniversary, Halo 3, Halo Reach and Halo 4.\nTheatre mode is exactly what it sounds like. Record clips from the game and play them back later with a free form camera. Perfect for content creation. \n\n[h1] Modding: [/h1]\nAs if there wasn't already so much content in the vanilla game, Halo MCC allows you run the game in anti cheat free mode, where you can install and play community created mods.\nGoes without saying that this will only age like fine wine.\n\n[h1] Well that's it folks: [/h1]\nYou mad lads that made it up to here; thank you for reading the ramblings of a mad man. \nDustin Echoes will forever watch over you.\n- Dave the Diver is a charming little 'Indie'* that still surprises you with new mechanics even hours in. The various activity cutscenes are pretty funny as well.\n\nJust a word of warning though. Mintrocket is NOT a indie studio, it's a subsidiary of NEXON, so DtD is entirely a NEXON game, and with how their reputation is it's pretty understandable to not buy this game just because of that.\n- A criminally underrated game, I have seldom seen a developer take their original hit which was already almost perfect, and actually manage to improve on it in every way shape and form. You do not need to have played the original to play or enjoy this game. Their stories are completely seperate.\n\nThe game itself is much less linear than its predecessor. The best way I can explain the feeling of going through the environments without referencing Grimrock itself is by saying it felt an awful lot like Myst to me, just with combat. Required puzzles for progression were challenging but not impossible, some of the secret challenges were much more difficult. I admit I used an online guide more than a few times, but it did nothing to diminish my enjoyment of the game. It is immersive, challenging, and satisfying. \n\nThe only drawback I can think of is the difficulty. It feels like you cannot win with any group composition, I suggest no more than 2 of any class or weapon/armor type user. I went with a warrior, two rogues(one range), and a mage, this way you as well makes you unlikely to complete a difficult fight or puzzle and be rewarded with something you cannot use. Combat itself can be challenging as I said, but you will rarely feel like you are simply incapable of winning. There are obvious ways to optimize the way you approach an encounter the second time if you die the first.\n\nBe prepared to immerse yourself, you must pay attention to your surroundings, read and remember notes you find, explore every nook and cranny you can find, and you will be rewarded. Good luck!\n\n- Civ 5, Heroes of Might and Magic had a baby together and that baby grew up and had a baby with Endless Space and this baby has now grown up and it is glorious in every level.\n\nIncredibly polished, incredibly neat, incredibly addictive and a game that stands out from the rest. If you like Empire-builders, this game is for you!\n\nIgnore the \"Early access\". This game is ready to be sold. I have only experienced one single bug in this game and the MP works like a clockwork. It's highly optimised, full of features and pretty to look at. I wish more Devs would make their games this way, it warms my heart!\n- The British Forces give the Allies a bit of the German defensive capacities. It has the problem of adding too many buildings to a game that is, in its core, dynamic and based on movement and aggressiveness instead of turtling. The British units are diverse and interesting, bringing much to the table. \n\nThe DLC lacks a proper campaign for the Brits, unfortunately, even though Caen, Goodwood, Arnhem and Walcheren could have been done in some interesting missions. But, for a game focused on multiplayer, the Tommies are obligatory in everybody's library.\n- Great game! \nLooking foward for the next chapters of the game!\nI love the spritework, its amazing!\nEven the music is very catchy and memorable \nFor an Early Access game, this game is very charsimatic and has tons of personality!\n\nIts just a shame that it was short in my opinion, i know you are going to add more stuff obviously, but i was hoping to get much more out of it because i loved it alot xD.\n\nPirate Software, I can't stress enough how much my excitement for this game is,  the demo back in 2017 already left me intrigued, but now im excited to see how this all plays out!\n- I love this game. In fact, I've loved it since I was in highschool about 8 years ago. My friend and I used to play this game together all the time on my flashdrive. We were always discussing & trying to understand the ins-&-outs of the game and how to get a specific ending depending on what you did. Playing this brought me back to those good times in that library.\n\nThe OSTs are nostalgic, the gameplay is about the same and the artwork is amazing as ever(actually the graphics are much better with this remake).\nThe only complaint I have is that it lags at random times(though usually in the menu). The original IB on RPGMaker never did that.\nOverall I'm glad I bought this so I could support the Dev and thank them for all those years of entertainment-\nI just wish there wasn't so much lag over an RPGMaker game.\n- [h1] 8.5/10 [/h1]\n\n[b] Please note that The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles is a very independent entry in the Ace Attorney series in terms of plot. Even if you have not played any of the Ace Attorney titles before, it will not affect your understanding of the game's plot. [/b]\n\nThis courtroom text adventure game in late 19th century Japan and British have a lot of features, even with the previous Ace Attorney works are very different. With the detailed character costumes and backgrounds, the strong sense of history and atmosphere, the majestic music, and excellent characterization, along with the game's detailed 3D character animation, players can experience an unprecedented adventure. In the plot, The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles presents a layer-by-layer, cocooning type of plot development, each chapter of the story is closely linked, and ambiguous, no chapter is meaningless, and in the final unraveling of all the mystery, the feeling of shock and excitement brought to the player is unprecedented in any text adventure game.\n\nThe reviews of The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles tend to be polarized, and not without reason. The progression of the plot brings with it an overwhelming lack of tension in the first and middle stages of the game. The design of many of the cases in the game seems rather undisciplined, neither interesting nor deep... The Great Ace Attorney: Adventure, as the first half of the game, though the development of the subsequent plot paved a lot of ambushes, the design of the plot and puzzles makes it less interesting and often difficult to motivate players to continue playing. The climax of the game comes too late, whether the player can persist to this point is a huge problem. At the same time, the Steam version of the game globally locks 30 frames, and can not set the Japanese voice is also a very huge drawback, and very damaging to the player's gaming experience.\n\nThe quality of The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles is actually not that bad. But this can only be concluded after you have experienced the entire game in its entirety... And I think this is actually the biggest drawback of this game because the ability to keep the player until the climax of the plot is the biggest pain point of this work. If you are very patient, love the Ace Attorney series, and love the suspenseful story of players, then The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles will not let you down. If you do not have any of the above elements, perhaps The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles will not give you a memorable experience.\n- Stephen's Sausage Roll is a game that the developer doesn't want normal people to buy, it seems. The description is literally, \"A simple 3d puzzle game.\", there is one video that shows you nothing about the game, and it's priced at $32 CND.\n\nFortunately, I'm here to tell you to get off your ass and to buy this wonderful game. The graphics are alright, the music is OK, but the puzzles are sublime.\n\nIn each level, the goal is the same: cook all the sausages and exit the level by standing on the exit level sign in the right orientation. You cook sausages by pushing them over a grill. Like in sokoban games, you can't pull the sausage (yet...), only push it. Another huge wrinkle is that sides of the sausage can only touch the grill once. If you touch a cooked side of a sausage to the grill, it will be burned and you fail the level. This little wrinkle will make you pull your hair out in some levels as you try and figure out how the hell you are going to maneuver the sausages around so they get cooked properly. A neat thing about the game is that if you fail, you can still continue playing the level, which might help you figure out how to play it.\n\nYou'll have a section (part of an island) that has a number of puzzles for you to solve in any order, so if you get stuck, you can try another one (until you get to the last puzzle of the section). Once you complete a section, a new section will open up with more puzzles.\n\nYour little guy has tank controls, which you will find extremely useful, as turning to the left or right near a sausage will push it in different directions. A nice detail is that the all of the puzzles make up the island section. When you activate a puzzle, the rest of the island drops away into the sea, leaving you on a tiny puzzle island.\n\nEach section introduces new mechanics into the game. First you'll just be pushing the sausages, but then you'll be stacking them, skewering them (you would think this would make things easier, but no! You can't turn when you have a skewered sausage!), walking on them...\n\nI would say that these levels are on the level of Snakebird, though I found many of them easier than Snakebird's puzzles (maybe I'm better at sokoban games than I know?). These are the kind of puzzles that you walk away from frustrated, but come back to a few hours later with the solution. This is the game where there are so many ah-ha! moments that make you feel smart. You have no idea what to do at first, but eventually you get better and better. You might not see solutions at first, but you begin to see where you need to go to solve the puzzle, and then work backwards from there. It's wonderful!\n\nIf you're having trouble, there's a community guide that has all the solutions, which is super helpful (though not as much when I was playing because it wasn't complete!).\n\nIt might be expensive, but I took 36 hours to solve all the puzzles and it was worth every penny.\n- Plants, please: A horticultural document thriller.\nGlory to Undermere.\nPros: \n- the writing and its illusion of effortless brilliance\n- attention to detail and consequences for player actions\n- \"gotta catch 'em all\" mentality that actually makes you feel smart\n- the intrigue, world-building, and game flow\n- petting the cat\n\nCons: I wish there was more music, or just none at all most of the time.\n- Open world exploration by design, pants soiling horror by incident. Blends the concepts of innate human fear of deep water and unknown danger with constant, all pervading curiosity.\n\nYou have to dive deeper. You have to know what's down there.\n- Not really that great of a game. It's fairly unengaging, very slow paced, impossible boss fights just a few hours in. Unless you like games that requre hours of picking plants to craft potions you rub on your sword to give you 3 minutes of attack boost to be able to do any damage, side quest grinding, boring activites, and the general RPG stat grinding, skip this one and just get the Witcher 3 which is a game magnitudes better. CD Projeck Red really made the Witcher and Withcer 2 for the hardcore RPG fans. The experience just isn't worth the time investment on this one in my opinion. Not going to finish it and just go enjoy the third game instead.\n\nEDIT: \nTR;DR: A mediocre hack-n-slash that has been dummed down from the predeccesor for consoles.\n- First off, just want to say this isn't a Metroidvania. This is a Zelda clone. And a good one!\n\nI bought this game because I heard it really put stress on you. You have limited time to complete the game and NPCs will begin dying if you aren't fast enough. Pretty crazy, right? Well, I do have a few gripes with that, but let me point out the good stuff first:\n+ Amazing combat. You have access to both guns and swords, but most of your damage will likely come from melee weapons since they have the ability to do an extremely-easy-to-pull-off PARRY! Parrying an enemy stuns it and gives your next attack against it a massive damage multiplier. All enemies, all bosses, and most projectiles are parryable, so this is what combat ends up revolving around. Even though I call it easy, you still get that cool feeling when you walk into an ambush and clear it without taking a hit, so it never gets dull as you go through the game.\n\n+ Good dungeon design. Since this game takes after Zelda, it's not shy about inserting a few puzzles into its dungeons. The overworld as well has quite a few surprising secrets and side quests that you won't be expecting when you play for the first time.\n\n+ Sequence breaks. This is mostly for New Game+ (or New Game Extra, a separate mode where you have access to major exploration items from the start, but not your whole endgame inventory), but it was interesting to find out how many secret paths and shortcuts there were, and how tightly they were managed. The devs thought of everything!\n\nSo now for the bad stuff.\n- Underwhelming story. Guess how much is really explained over the course of this story. If you guessed \"all of it\", you would be completely wrong and here's your dunce hat. Unsighted ends up spending so much of its time on the protagonist's relationships that it fails to answer several of the more important questions concerning the game's backstory. Why was there was a war? Who started it? Where are the humans now? Why are they so disorganized? Why do they seem to have no chain of command whatsoever? How did the automatons ever win anything at all at any point when they seem so extremely outclassed? I guess it doesn't matter. Look, there's two robot-girls kissing.\n\n- Fake pressure. I heard there was going to be pressure before I started the game, so I decided to go DEFCON 1 from the get-go and rush everything. I ended up completing the game in 10 in-game days and I felt pretty good about it. Zero NPC deaths! Zero! I'm a super awesome amazing hero, right? Well, credits roll and... the only achievement I get is the one for beating the game. No one really cares and apparently you're meant to play through multiple times anyway. So... why did I ever care? Why is this mechanic even in the game? All it did was make me shy away from general exploration and side quests since all of those things are less important than, ya know, saving the world. You can call that interesting, but when it has no payoff, it ends up being frustrating.\n\n- No post-game. Did I mention, if you bumrush the game and finish with just hours left on everyone's timers, you don't get to do any extra no-timer exploring afterwards? No, the game's over. Load the save and you get set back to where you were before fighting the final boss. If you want to do any actual exploring, that's what \"Explorer\" mode is for. You know, that mode that makes you feel like you're cheating?\n\nBasically, Unsighted is another game filled with missed opportunities. I recommend this game because the core gameplay and level design is very well done and very well executed, but you should probably know this before you start:\n\nThe only pressure here is the one you imagine. Since the game does nothing to acknowledge your successes, just play it at your own pace and don't be shy about using Explorer. Shame on the devs for hailing the agony of defeat, but not the thrill of victory.\n- Medium performance issues (as of 2/28/22) but GOTY game. This game is amazing and absolutely dripping with content. FromSoft didn't make Dark Souls 4. This game is Dark Souls 4, 5, and 6 all in one. Absolutely massive game and the open world part doesn't feel like an attempt to pad the game like most games, here's why:\n- Picking up items in the open world doesn't have a pickup animation. This might not seem like a lot but go play something like Dragon Age: Inquisition and you'll know what I'm talking about.\n- You can pick up items while on horseback (also no animation), Greatly speeds up looting while in the open world\n- Summoning pools makes getting summoned for bosses is easier than ever. All you have to do is be in the same general overworld location as a pool and all location get a summon sign\n- Sooooo many more bonfire locations. Can also fast travel from almost anywhere using the in-game map.\n- packed with stuff to do. Very rarely are you walking/riding for long periods before running into a dungeon/boss/camp/npc/etc. Every single side location has something to discover, Plus you never know what you're going to get and the feeling of discovery is unlike any other game out there.\n\nThere are a lot of improvements over previous installments as well. In no particular order, here are some of my standouts:\n- POWERSTANCING IS BACK BABYYYYY. Was always my favorite thing from DS2.\n- Slottable weapon arts. Taking the weapon art system from DS3 and making it even better. This system is also tied to the weapon affinity system which allows you to switch up the scaling of a weapon at any bonfire. No more committing to a specific element or stat.\n- The open world makes the game more accessible. Hit a wall with one zone? Just go somewhere else and come back when stronger. Sekiro had this a little but this game it's extremely pronounced.\n- The statues of Marika make it so the runbacks for bosses is not nearly as grueling. These statues work as \"respawn only\" bonfires that you can choose to respawn back at and are usually just outside a boss fight room after a lengthy run. You can't rest at them or adjust your build there, but they prevent the grueling runback and allow you to smash your face into a boss over and over with minimal downtime.\n- Having a dedicated jump button but keep the power of jump attacks. Risky usually, but can also be used as a counter to low swinging attacks. This also adds into the next system of...\n- Poise breaking enemies. Is done by heavy attacking, jump attacking and guard countering. Adds even more move types to the game and makes every weapon a totally different playstyle and adds to the replay value.\n- What are guard counters? After successfully blocking and attack, you can follow it up with a special heavy attack that has high poise damage. Allows for more critical hits. You might think this makes it easier but it takes more skill than you'd think to time these ripostes and it always feels good.\n\nAs with any game, it's not for everyone, but if you love souls games, you'd be doing yourself a disservice by missing this one. If you've never played a souls game, this is the best one to try. The most accessible by far. No crazy hard tutorial bosses, the new ashen summoning bell gives some great support in difficult areas, and the fact you can always leave harder fights and come back to them later makes it so you rarely run into situations where you know booting up the game means you're gonna be brick walling until either the boss dies or you give up.\n- Never understood why everybody started hating this game.\nFirst it was too hard, so dev made it easier.\nThen it was too clunky, so dev remade the UI again and again (it's still not perfect though but I saw big improvements overtime).\nThen it was another thing and another one and no matter what dev team did, people were still mad at them ...\nI did enjoy this game since the beginning, I adapted each time the game changed and yet people kept whining because it wasn't exactly how they felt it shoud have been.\nAfter all this hard work and still getting pooped in the face, the dev team left ... how strange, right ?\n\nI'm not mad at the dev team, but I'm so sad that people can't understand that making others miserable because they don't have exactly what they want (and having paid for it is no excuse to this behavior in my opinion) will make them give up on their task ...\n\nFor what it's worth, I miss you Handyman team :(, but thank you anyway for the actual game cause I really don't feel that I've been robbed and I still enjoy it from time to time.\n- I love skyrim, but please stop hiding it on steam, i don't want to buy a £30 game i can get for £10 anywhere else. Also stop hiding the DLC's! For anyone who isn't able to get access to the DLC store pages i went through the trouble of finding them, heres the links:\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/211720/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim__Dawnguard/\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/226880/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim__Dragonborn/\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/220760/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim__Hearthfire/\nIf you don't wanna pay full price for the DLC's go to cdkeys and get the legendary edition for £5.99, if you already own the game it's not a problem it will just add the DLC's to your library.\nhttps://www.cdkeys.com/the-elder-scrolls-v-5-skyrim-legendary-edition-pc\n\n- This game will leave you satisfied.\n\nI know that doesn't sound like much of a selling point, but it is. This game won't give you a sequal hook, it won't give you a product carved away like a thanksgiving turkey, each part sold seperately or held to ransom. \n\nThis is not a game about standing victorious over your enemies, it's not a game with some kind of adrenal rush that will leave you drained and empty afterwards.\n\nThis isn't a game about saving the world, as surprising as that may sound considering the hero's goal.\n\nThis is a game about hope. Hope for tomorrow, hope for your fellow man, hope for dreams and wishes, hope for a last shimmer of light in the encroaching darkness.\n\nThis is a game that will make you ask things about yourself, even if only subconciously. \n\nBut, most importantly of all, this is an experience that will make you say \"I was happy to be there, if only for a time.\"\n\nAnd I was, in fact, happy to be here.\n\nHats off to you ladies and gentlemen, you made a cyinical old bastard smile for a good ten hours.\n- ULTRAKILL is a fine game with cool movement mechanics. However most of the guns don't feel beefy at all and, really, there's not much content to be had. Wait for ACT 3 before forking out $20 for this.\n\nedit: after getting every p rank, gaming\n- The game is decent but not worth $15 for a slightly better looking version of a 2 hour game that is 9 years old. I can only recommend it if you really like these kind rpg maker horror games, because it's among the best in its field.\n- Stunning pixel art platformer where you will travel through different eras fighting hordes of enemies even using the ability to change time! Super recommended, a must try if you like platformers!\n- Just look at my game time if you wanna know how passionate I am about this game\n- Always have to be online, even to play single player. Why?\n\nThis would be a perfect Steam Deck game, but they fucked it up.\n\nUPDATE OCT 20th: So they added off-line mode just for Steam Deck, which is great, but not allowing off-line mode on your PC is strange. Hopefully they update it again.\n\n【グループB】\n- Only originally bought this to support the artist, since I'm a huge fan of his pixel art work. It's amazing, and there's a tonne of eye candy to fill your eyeballs with. However, I can't recommend this to everyone as after the first few hours it's become a bit of a chore.\n\n- The game is a \"clicker\" type with rpg/upgrade elements. It's too slow to play in the background/absent mindedly but not fast enough to keep your attention fully.\n- Each round/attempt at a boss takes way too goddamn long. \n- Barely any interaction with the world. You build tower defense style, and equip new items, but beyond that you don't have any special abilities, no \"oh shit\" once per loop power, no ability to target specific enemies, nothing. Just watch everything play out and hope your little guy doesn't get pulped.\n- Crafting/Supplying is sort of hidden away and if you don't know about dismantling you'll never grind out all the items you need to build new stuff.\n- Lore/Journal entries are hidden away and require resources to unlock using a little button on the bottom of the screen that's easy to miss. I only found it 20 hours in. The writing is cringey and obviously done by someone who probably enjoys Adam Sandler films.\n- The card system is a neat idea, but jesus christ there's too much garbage shuffling. Imagine playing MtG with a deck of 100 cards and 90 of them are lands, and everytime you get a new hand you reshuffle the whole deck so all you get is more lands. Oblivion (destroys a tile) rarely, if ever, pops up. \n- Character skills are kinda bad? You might get a good one every level (which again, takes forever) but half the time it'll be useless \"leave 10% of food/resources at camp\" when you're not doing a resource grind run.\n- So much trash equipment you have to sort through and breaks game flow.\n\nAnd the biggest \"don't recommend\" from me would be the issue with how combining tiles works. If you put two tiles beside each other they sometimes change the tiles to something else. Example - put a Vampire Mansion beside a Village and you get a town full of ghouls that after 3 loops around the map turns into an upgraded town. But you still get trash equipment from the quests it gives, and putting a Vampire Mansion beside any other type of town doesn't change that town at all. So there's no reason to experiment, and it really limits the gameplay. You'd think they'd focus on that aspect gameplay wise, especially with experimentation to get the most bonuses out of all your tiles... but no. There's a small list of things that interact with each other, and that's it.\n\nI still highly recommend it since the game is cheap, the art is amazing and the artist/indie devs should get support. But I think it's a good 2-3 major updates, expansions or fan modding away from getting really, really amazing.\n- if we showed this to senators in the 90's video games would be banned today\n- the game itself is pretty ok and fun for what it is, and runs great on deck. but man, F**K THE ALWAYS-ONLINE-DRM WHICH AT TIMES TAKES AGES TO CONNECT, GETTING THE GAME STUCK IN THE MENU WITH NOTHING TO DO!!\n\n>> Update after 20h played:\nI really enjoy playing the game. It is good, it is fun and runs great on the Steam Deck, which is especially important to me, as I tend to travel a lot as part of my job.\n\nThat being said, however, is core of the issue: The Always-On-DRM actually prevents me from playing this game on the go. Having this sort of DRM is, in my opinion, only predatory and inexcusable in any way. I get that the online-components of the game will not work when I am on the move, but I am mainly interested in the single player experience, from which I am also locked out. I am even locked out of the main menu without a stable internet collection, which is just ridiculous.\n- Do NOT buy this game! This game does not even have a minimap/GPS/coordinate system. You will definitely get lost.\nMultiplayer is fully of bug and lags so much.\nDo NOT buy this game!\nDo NOT buy this game!\nDo NOT buy this game!\n\nThis game is so f*** stupid\n- While still a work very much in progress, Nuclear Throne is currently one of my favorite games. It's a roguelike dungeon crawler with heavy \"bullet-hell\" elements and a little RPG sprinkled on top. When you begin a session of Nuclear Throne, you choose from one of several well-designed & freakish \"mutants\", each with their own special attributes which, in itself, does much to add variety (there's also a random-select option which is a fun idea in this particular case). The goal of each stage is to exterminate all of the enemies. After doing so, a portal opens which takes your mutant freak to the next level. There are a great many weapons with which to inflict meyhem on your adversaries. As you gain experience points, in the form of green goo earned by killing enemies & also found in cache jars, you'll be able to choose new persistent perks for your character (such as more HP or certain weapons doing more damage). Every so-often, you'll encounter a boss. The bosses tend to pop in during the height of an already-in-progress battle which makes beating them all-the-more difficult & hectic.\n\nOriginally, this game did not have controller support which was a great disappointment (though I had been ejoying it anyway, using the keyboard and mouse). However, a recent update rectified this and the gameplay using a dual-analog controller (such as that of the Xbox 360) is just fantastic. Like Ultratron before it (another very similar game which is also worth a look; I also wrote a review for it, if you're interested in checking it out), Nuclear Throne throws you straight back to the arcades of yore and plops you in front of a Smash TV cabinet.\n\nAs a roguelike dungeon-crawler, the replay value is extremely high (due to the fact that the level and enemy layout is totally different from one session to the next). The rather extreme difficulty doesn't hurt either, as playing entails dying and thus restarting... a lot. Fortunately, said difficulty isn't of the variety that compels you to smash your controller/keyboard in frustration. Every death feels like the fault lay squarely on *your* shoulders (if only you had moved to dodge a little faster or conserved ammo a little better!), as opposed to the game feeling like it's cheating. Another stand-out feature which I think I need to bring up is the soundtrack. ...Just wow! Nuclear Throne's score is totally original and extremely surreal. It goes *miles* in lending its own atmosphere to the game. \n\nSome might consider the current price of $12.99 to be just a *little* steep for a game in this class, but considering how well it's made overall and the fun I've gotten from it (especially being in its currently pre-release/beta state), I consider it to be well worth the price. As of the time of this writing, the developer(s) is very active and updates are coming quite frequently.\n\nUPDATE 01/12/16: I hadn't played this game in quite a while (at least 6+ months) and I wanted to check out the progress that the devs have made, etc. Well... The game starts but as soon as I select a character, it totally locks up. I can't play it at all. To make matters worse, I've heard that the devs have since \"abandoned\" development of this game (so it's not likely that whatever is causing the crashes for me is going to be fixed any time soon - or ever). Bummer man. I loved this game...\n- To be honest, this game is a bit of an acquired taste. At first I didn't get it: Few options to customize your army, at the beginning of a battle every unit has its predetermined place on the map, there's an unforgiving time limit to reach your objectives and the graphics could be much better. The first encounters with an entrenched enemy ended in a bloodbath for my units, despite overall superiority in numbers and total command of the air. And when I learned that you don't necessarily keep your veteran units after a successful battle but sometimes have to start the next scenario with new ones, I came close to deleting the game.\n\nLuckily, I  didn't. Like any decent strategy-game, UOCII takes some time to learn. The game's mechanics and its reliance on logistics are the main differences to most others I've played. The first lesson: Your success depends heavily on understanding both your own and the enemy's supply network. Finding his vulnerable spots while protecting your own is elementary. Once you figured out where to strike and with which units, your chances improve dramatically. The AI is quite good and will help you find your own weak spots soon enough – a single forgotten enemy in your rear can easily stop the most impressive offensive, if it decides to block the one railway line supporting all your units and your HQ. +-To make things more interesting, the game relies on Headquarters, which you have to move around together with your regular units. These HQ can and must be improved over time to learn additional “skills” like bridge-building, special orders, emergency supply etc. During a battle, they must be kept within range of your units to be effective, giving the game a bit of an role-playing-aspect: One or several generals moving around, each commanding a part of your force, never too close to the firing line, all the while learning new skills and helping your units to do a limited number of special tricks. Nice flavour.\n\nI could write a lot more, but to sum it up: UOCII is a really rewarding strategy-game with some new and interesting features I haven't found anywhere else. It's not perfect – more options to customize or to place units would be welcome and the difficulty in some of the later DLCs is quite brutal -  but all in all it's very much worth its price. Still enjoy it after several years and look forward to the next DLC (Africa) :-)\n- Blows every single PFS game of the last decade out of the water, even those shitty D**M games that people who never played FPS games before seems to worship in order to look cool. Smooth and fast gameplay with a lot of variety. Great visuals even on medium/high settings. Story and writing is shit but pretty much on the same level as rest of the Borderlands series with the exception of the Telltale one. Writing has always been the worst part of the series, dont be delusional retards.\n- The game vaguely reminds me of Yume Nikki and Strange Telephone due to thematic similarities, but in the end, I think it managed to be something completely different - I don't want to compare it directly to Undertale, but I got those narrative vibes as well. Unlike its exploration-based relatives, UNREAL LIFE is somewhat of a linear game, but the areas tend to loop around into the hub when using waypoints, occasionally involving some backtracking and optional achievements (including a game within a game). It took me about 6 hours to get 2 bad endings on the same playthrough, that said I am missing more than half of the achievements and probably other endings as well. Despite its modest art style, I think the locations and the world design were very good, granted the game settings are very limited for the price. The writing and characters were the highlight of the experience for me, I would say I enjoyed about 95% of the dialogue and world-building, despite being a very text-heavy game. The game tells a story in a unique way where the character can extract memories from the objects that she touched, unlocking potential hints that you will need to solve puzzles.\n\nYour room works as a hub area to which you can return for manual saves or the minigame, additionally to connecting all areas with a waypoint system, but you don't have to worry too much about those as the checkpoints are very frequent. Generally, the gameplay is just exploring 2D levels, picking up items, and occasionally solving creative sequence puzzles. The character keeps track of 3 different memories that may contain clues if you managed to miss them - it's hard to do because the important text is color-coded. I want to give the devs credit for actually putting some originality into puzzle mechanics, they were fun and not difficult enough to drag the game down. However, when the character learns about a hidden item from the memory, you have to click in the correct spot with no indication, which is perfectly fine, I only wish I realized it sooner. For any Yume fans out there, the game works as a psychedelic visual candy, with many dream-like environments and themes to navigate. \n\n[i]In a way, playing through this game reminded me of the first time I finished watching Spirited Away, the journey so immersive it left me in a state of melancholy. Do you ever get a feeling that you changed as a person after finishing a game? [/i]\n\n[h1] Pros: [/h1]\n\n+ fun characters, enjoyable narrative \n+ multiple endings and optional achievements \n+ creative puzzle based on memory mechanics \n+ nice variety of locations\n+ awesome soundtrack \n\n[h1] Feedback: [/h1]\n\n[u] Some Nitpicks [/u] - I ended up playing on a controller, but if you are using a mouse you have to drag the character around, it would be nice to have the clicking option instead - if it has one I don't know how to activate it. I was slightly confused by the main menu controls when using a controller, but if you can't figure out the buttons you can select the options with the mouse. I wish you just had the visual Q like \"new game\", \"load game\" and so on. Sometimes to progress you may have to talk to characters multiple times, so just make sure that you exhaust all dialogue before moving on. On a side note, you can softlock the game if the water turtle pushes you against the platform (not a big deal, reload 10 second checkpoint). Overall, I don't have any real issues with the game, mostly the story felt like sliding on a big stick of butter.  \n\n[b] Overall Thoughts: 9/10 [/b]\n\nIs it worth $20? Well, it's a really good game for this niche genre if you like those types of ambient/psychedelic games like Dreaming Sarah - it feels bigger and more ambitious than most. There is no question that devs put so much love into the project, but it's still a niche game at the end of the day. My skepticism slowly faded away as the game kept being compelling in the storytelling and enjoyable locations. As someone that plays many games that occupy the same space, I can't really imagine a game that offers much more than that. For me, it was a special game, and by 'special' I mean like it hit a nerve, got pretty personal. \n\n[code]Review By: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/31294838-Hidden-Gem-Discovery/ [/code]\n- [h1][u]Wonderful game with a great battle system, but terrible netcode[/u][/h1]\n\n[h2]Foreword[/h2]\nI got to know \"Naraka: Bladepoint\" through a friend.\nAt first I was very skeptical, so I only bought the Standard Edition, and later the Ultimate and Deluxe Editions.\nFirst of all, this game has a steep learning curve with its battles.\nExactly why the game may not be suitable for everyone.\nUnfortunately, that doesn't make the playerbase any better, but read more about that below.\nNevertheless, the game and especially the combat system offers a lot of potential and has a lot of posivites to offer.\n\n[h2]Positives[/h2]\n[list]\n[*]Regular updates with ever increasing content\n[*]Few to almost no bugs and if they are, then they are fixed very quickly\n[*]Steep learning curve - Especially at the beginning the game is not easy, but you can quickly get into it with friends\n[*]Pleasant graphics\n[*]Nice sound design, which is location dependent\n[*]Potential to grind for higher ranks and for the Hall of Fame\n[*]Different game modes and events\n[*]Extremely extensive combat system - many possibilities to conter weapons\n[*]Extensive stats, either ingame or with Naraka+ mobile app (app is absolutely top!)\n[*]Well thought through character designs\n[*]Extremely individual character editor - From Thanos to Bruce Lee everything is customizable.\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Neutral[/h2]\n[list]\n[*]Climbing system - It's really good compared to other games. However, you still sometimes get stuck on edges or can't get to the platforms above.\n[*]Microtransactions - I'm personally not a fan of them, but it's not a must in this game and doesn't favor anyone.\n[*]Answers of Discord team members very questionable on some questions\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Negatives[/h2]\n[list]\n[*]Terrible netcode - players with highpings are treated preferentially\n[*]Few European players - Extremely many VPN players with many different Asian characters and languages in the voicechat\n[*]Voicechat is not well thought through\n[*]Partial performance losses\n[*]Ranking matches are partly wrong - Either with new players (Bronze) or experienced players (Asura)\n[*]Partially bad English, as well as German translation\n[*]Some abilities are combined absolutely disgusting and unfortunately more or less meta\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Review written out[/h2]\nNaraka has become a real love-hate relationship game for me.\nI love the extensive combat system and also the steep learning curve from noob to a slightly experienced player. (I am Platinum 1 - Solar 5 at the time of this review).\nSo while the combat system could be frustrating at times at first, I love it all the more now.\nOnly the climbing system, as well as some combinations of abilities or ultimates could be revised.\nFor example, it is common practice (meta) that many players use Ultimates that stun and ensure that you immediately get into the next Ultimate.\nThis is sometimes a bit frustrating, because these combinations are played very often and other heroes, especially the new ones, are not really played because of it. \nHowever, you can work around these combinations or counter them yourself. Unfortunately, this is not always easy, especially for new players.\n(For example, the combination of Valda - Viper - Tianhai).\nHowever, a victory and the killing of opponents, especially higher ones, with whom you are unfortunately sometimes matched, releases a lot of endorphins in Naraka, so that a victory feels extremely rewarding.\n\nUnfortunately, this brings me to the part that makes it extremely difficult for me to decide on a positive rating for this game.\nThe game, for being released in 2021, has a horrible netcode for a martial arts battle royale game.\nThere are extremely many Asian players who connect directly or via VPN to the europian servers.\nThis is especially noticeable when you activate the voice chat, which by the way, has no individual regulation for volume or a mute function per player.\nUnfortunately, those players have a ping beyond 150ms.\nSadly, this is a big problem for people with low latency.\nYou partly punch through enemies bodies.\nVarious focus attacks are therefore not always blockable or the opponent lags at you, while the player for himself has no lags at all.\nThis is not only unfair, but should actually no longer be a problem in 2022.\nFor example, it would be enough to not let players with a ping greater than 150ms/200ms move.\nAccording to the Discord community manager, there is a region lock and most of the names are just \"memes\" . \nBut you don't notice anything about the region lock in the game and we can theoretically connect to other servers.\n\nAnother big problem is the matchmaking.\nEven with Bronze or Silver, you are matched with Asura players when there is a lack of players.\nThis is not necessarily nice, but you get a lot of points for survival and you also learn a lot of techniques.\n\nAs negative as this all sounds, the game still gets a positive rating from me.\nI love the sound design, which comes into its proper place in the battles and is different for each location on the map.\nThis reminds me of Prince of Persia in some areas and provides more excitement in fights.\nIn addition, the varied battles, no matter how hopeless they sometimes seem, are all the more rewarding if you win.\nEspecially when you're killing another team, consisting of 3 people, as the last survivor of your team.\nThe map design is also absolutely great. Every location has been carefully thought through. \nGreat lighting design really highlights some of the locations.\nYou can overlook small bugs like misplaced branches (a branch hangs in the air next to a tree).\n\nBut my favorite part is the grinding to a higher rank. \nThe ranking system and especially the Hall of Fame encourage you to play.\nGetting into the top 100 of a much-played character feels very rewarding.\nSo does slaying a moonbane.\n\n[h2]Epilogue[/h2]\nAll in all, despite the flaws, Naraka has a lot going for it, and even though the larger issues can be extremely frustrating, the game saves itself with the extensive battle system, the incredibly great locations including sound design, and the extensive ranking system including Hall of Fame.\nI love the game because of the thoughtful little things, even if I hate it extremely at times.\n\nEven though the game can quickly become frustrating for new players, you should be aware that it has a lot to offer if you are willing to learn.\nThe accompanying app is an extremely well thought through and great gimmick in this regard.\n\nI would be happy to take you by the hand and introduce you to the game.\nJust visit us on our [URL=https://discord.nox-eagles.de]Discord[/URL].\n\nI would like to thank all of you who have read my review until the end.\nI'm looking forward to your opinions :)\nWith best regards\nYour Holt\n- If you notice that Kagami voice sounds different, that’s because the guy who voiced him in the first game, Brad Venable, died at the beginning of last year. This time, Kagami is voiced by Austin Lee Mathews, who voiced Roche (Final Fantasy VII Remake) and Ash Carbide (Cold Steel III and IV). \n\nRest In Peace, Brad. We may forget Kaniza’s name, but we won’t forget yours. And thank you for being one of the funniest character in the game.\n- This game has such a HUGE potential like Stardew Valley in its early days!!\nCollecting stuff, helping people by crafting potions its so rewarding and lovely pls dear developers keep working on it. I BEG YOU! :D\nSure it has some bug right now but even on day one they managed to get some fast fixes and tried their best to make it work for everyone. \nThe controls were a bit tricky in the beginning (used Playstation 5 Controller) but its just a matter of time, its just not the normal controls like in other games.\nThe music was pretty nice and chill and also the animations were super cute, i love watching little Rubrum built his sandcastles over and over again. >3< \n\nOverall a good game, but could become even more better in the future, keep going guys!!\n- Definitely recommend !\nBut let's be honest here, it's early access and it fits the status of the game completely, threre are a couple of issues which would require change as soon as possible.\nHowever, the devs are incredibly responsive, they do listen to the community and as a result, the game is already much much much better than it originally was.\nA lot of work was already put into the game and a lot more is incoming.\n\nThis said, the game's title isn't too catchy and doesn't really reflect what the game really is.\n\nYou start the game by controlling manually controlling a train (you can control more than one later), the map is divided between the track of your opponent and your track.\n\nThe goal is to utterly destroy your opponent or at least survive waves.\n\nYou will need to travel around your track and dock to mines to build mining facilities, collect ores and bring them back to your HQ. There is also another spot you can use to build a specific building which will help you like radars.\n\nYou will use that ore to start research (new weapons, speed and whatnot) and upgrade your train (called an AMP) and build more defenses. Each building is protected by a force field which will make them hard to destroy and also protect you while you are docked to build, upgrade, repair or collect ores.\n\nYou can move freely on the track and control the speed of your AMP, change direction, change track direction and get a sattelite view to help you fight the enemy.\n\nBasically, fighting works as in an artillery game...\nThe map is always covered with fog of war but when an enemy or you fire, you will produce noise which will be clearly indicated on the map. This is when you will be able to use your recon ability to launch a projectile which will show you the area for a couple seconds and you can then fire.\nEach time you fire, you have to take into account the wind which can make your projectile miss, firing right now use a bowstring but it is going to disapear. Your firing range is also limited so you do have to travel near the opponent to be able to hit it.\n\nAnd that's pretty much it. The concept is quite inovative, it works pretty well and it will get a lot better in the future.\nIf you're scared to purchase the game right away becaue of the early access tag, I advise you to keep it in a corner and wait for it to evolve until the development reach a more advanced point because the game is pretty unique and quite beautiful.\nRight now controlling and managing the trains can be a bit tedious and not really easy to master but I think we can trust the devs team to find a solution to the problems.\n- Dandara is inspired by a legendary warrior who fought slavery in Brazil in the 17th Century. The similarities, however, seems to stop at the name and the fact that she is a black woman fighting a vague concept referred in the game as \"opression\". \nThe game mechanics are very unusual as you can`t really move back and forth and the art style is often charming, although sometimes it gets really generic with some enemies  inspired by Egyptian culture (I thought it was supposed to be about Brazil). The difficulty escalates quite suddenly at certain points in the game, and the fact that you have to be standing still at all times to attack your enemies is pretty frustrating. After you get used to the movement in the game, it is quite fun to jump around without the frustration of having to walk slowly through a huge map as you do in some games of the genre, especially before getting upgrades that allow you to teleport or move faster.\n The story and dialogues could also have been polished a little more. Everything is very vague making it feel a little bit like a waste of an interesting idea. Dandara is a little rough around the edges, but  pretty unique for a metroidvania style game. Worth checking out.\n- I thought I could overcome the Chinese Language barrier since I read chinese webnovels, but as it turns out trying to decipher game content is a different ballgame from novels. \nSo far, what I can make of the story is making me cringe and I can't quite figure out the combat mechanics, but I'm hoping that English translation will make it better (optimistic). Probably 5.5/10 for now and I'll revise when i get the English experience?\n- This game can be great at times but extremely frustrating most of the time. 80% change to hit, miss every time. I can't keep playing a game with so much crappy coding.\n- This game is shit, and the devs should eat shit for shitting this shit on top of gamer community's head.\nCombat? You need a piano keyboard to dodgeparryhitlowhithighlowthendodge. Its a clusterfuck! Reaction time? None. I tried to dodge, I got damaged, Parry same story. And don't get me started on fucking archery! HELLOO ITS 2021, PUT A FUCKING CROSSHAIR so I can hit something !!\n\nWow, what a piece of shit. 18 hours of my life spent TRYING to make sense of this clusterfuck of a game. Pity I can't get a refund AND throw dung at this whitewashed game, like people did to Deuscht.\n\nI hope you devs sit on it and rotate.\n\n- Wanna spend 20% of the time scared, 60% of the time confused, 15% of the time infuriated, and 5% of the time laughing your ass off? THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU!\n\nFor the rest, save your money.\n\nIt's so buggy, dark, poorly optimized, and confusing; you'll spend more time pulling your hair out than the rare moments that it actually manages to pull off a jumpscare. Also, it is NOT procedurally generated at all. Watched a YouTuber play this game and got the exact same map and jumpscares... er... \"jumpscares\" as they did. Not worth $10. If they can fix the bugs and tweak a few things, though, it'd at least be worth 5.\n\n- This is a story about relationships.\nThis is a story about opposites.\nThis is a story about reflections.\nThis is a story about redemption.\nThis is a story about damnation.\nThis is a story about reconciliation.\nThis is a story about gods.\nThis is a story about paradoxes.\nThis is a story about love.\nThis is a story about hate.\nThis is a story about life.\nThis is a story about death.\nThis is a story about forgiveness.\nThis is a story about condemnation.\nThis is a story about time and time loops.\nThis is a story about multiverse theory.\nThis is a story about murder.\nThis is a story about betrayal.\nThis is a story about trust.\nThis is a story about freedom.\nThis is a story about happiness.\nThis is a story about sadness.\nThis is a story about boredom.\nThis is a story about a Princess.\nThis is a story about what looks like a Frog at one point.\n\nThis is a story about everything and nothing.  A poem and a screed.\n\nIt begins with a simple instruction: Go kill the Princess, and a simple choice: will you kill her, will you free her, or simply walk away?  Oh, you can also decide to let her remain a prisoner; choosing to do essentially nothing is still a choice.\n\nIt ends with a question: who is she?  Also, who are you?  More importantly, what are you to one another?\n\nThis review also ends with a question: \"Should you buy this game?\" and an answer: \"Hell yes, you should!\"\n- Overwhelmingly positive. pfft come on!\nThis game is walking and a puzzle simulator. Everything damn thing in this game is missing. \nThis game is not even a shooter, can almost pass by every damn zombie.\nAll you have to do is run and solve puzzles.\nBeen solving puzzles for 13 hours. Barely got time to shoot anything.\n- This is probably one of the best \"battlefield\" type games out there, i was super disapointed at these days battlefields and want it to go back to those good ol'days battlefields. I got this and some more, amazing maps except from some. I still think the game is amazing, but no game is perfect due to the poor progression system... But they are addressing this with updates to fix this, which is amazing.\n- While the game isn't on standard with the new Warhammer games, it does feature a very interesting time period. Sadly though, I cannot recommend this game in its current state. The game wasn't perfect, sure. But over recent time they have added elements that will disrupt your experience, if you are looking for a somewhat realistic and immersive Total War. PM me if you need a further explanation.  \n\nI'd buy it for 3 to 5 dollars when it goes on sale - then I would say it was passable and good for some hours fun until my previous points kick in.\n- While i'm not far into it, so far it is great. All negative reviews are due to the stuttering. I have a 3070 and I googled a solution.\n\nWIth Nvidia GPUs go to Nvidia control panel and change the global shader cache size in 3d settings to unlimited. Also limit the fps of Elden Ring, I have it set to 60 fps. So far no problems on my end. Hope this helps somebody choosing to get the game.\nIf u have AMD GPUs I don't know specifics so please ask google sorry for not being able to help, but I know it is a similar process.\n\nNow 30hrs in the game is so good too\n\nNow done with the game it is amazing\n- Stellaris is the contemporary 4X sci fi galactic empire grand strategy to play.  The spiritual successor to ancient space exploration games like Master of Orion and Star Wars: Rebellion.  Start out with just your homeworld and send out scout ships and colonies until you've got your own star empire. \n\nManage your population, tell them what to build, design your own spaceships and fleet structures, and then get pounded into the dirt by the far too cheaty AI... yeah, it's another one of those games where because it's hard to make the AI smart, Paradox decided instead to just make the AI units cheat and become ridiculously overpowered.\n\nI have to say the game is probably far too difficult even if you set all the difficulty to the easiest levels, it's unclear what the developers were thinking, but you can mod the game easily in Steam Workshop to make it viable to play single player. \n\nAs with all Paradox games the DLC pricing is murder, and it adds very little to the core game experience, so my advice is to grab this on sale if you were a fan of MOO, go straight to Steam Workshop and mod it until it's playable, and then you'll have a perfect time sink well worth your money.\n- After playing thousands of games both singleplayer and multiplayer, unlocking all achievements and getting every solo map medal, I think it's time for a review:\n\nIf you like tower defence games: I recommend.\nIf you like any previous Bloons games: I recommend.\nIf you want something casual and chill: I recommend.\nIf you want a bit of a challenge: I recommend.\n\nThe tower type variety is interesting and diverse, with 5 tiers of upgrades each (plus special \"paragon\" towers)\nThe game devs have been providing free updates for years.\nThere's lots of achievements and medals to get.\nThere's online co-op, boss events and even different game-modes.\n\nThe game is more expensive than it used to be, but literally any sale price makes it worth a buy!\n- Bullet hell? Check.\nAwesome animations? Check.\nBoss fights? Check.\nSongs from favorite artists? Check.\nParty mode? Check.\nMultiplayer/online mode? Check.\nBest physics? Check.\nOk that list is good... for now\n- A Visual Novel meets The Stanley Parable by way of Disco Elysium. This game contains a shocking amount of depth of content and thematics behind it's excellent voice acting and 3-colour sketchy visual style. Well worth a play if you're intrigued.\n- What should i say, the dream has come true.\nKept us waiting, huh.\n\n---\nOLD REVIEW JUST FOR DOCUMENTATION\n\nif you're new, here's your list of the main games\n\nmetal gear (msx)\nmetal gear 2 (msx)\nmetal gear solid (ps1)\nmetal gear solid 2 sons of liberty (ps2)*\nmetal gear solid 3 snake eater (ps2)*\nmetal gear solid 4 guns of the patriots (ps3)\nmetal gear rising: revengeance (pc)\nmetal gear solid peace walker hd (ps3)\nmetal gear solid v ground zeroes (pc)\nmetal gear solid v the phantom pain (pc)\n\n*: mgs2 and mgs3 have a ps3/x360 HD ver.\n*: there is also mgs2: substance and mgs3: subsistence which are expanded editions: the former has bonus VR missions, snake tales, skateboarding and extras. and the latter includes extra content + metal gear 1 and 2.\n\nthank you for all the mem(es)ories kojima san!\n- The Witch's House has been my most favorite RPG Maker horror game for years and now I have the remaster which I can buy to directly support the developer. Needless to say how good it is so I will only talk about what is changed and what still remains.\nThe game is still suspenseful and very atmospheric. Some people may worry that the updated graphic and engine may take that away but trust me it is still there and not going anywhere.\nSome sound effects/dialogues have been changed beside the graphic which I am not against it at all. Still very like the remaster.\nThe control is still the same which is as clunky as before when you are not used to. I think the developers know that and decided to not change it so I won't complain. Just say it out for you to know because the game is very old so the control is still there in the past with many other RPG maker games.\nI very like the new graphic and I think they deserve much more compliments for this. However, I like the weird-big-eye Viola model and her less hair skinny portrait more. It look weird and funny at the same time. The new model makes her more beautiful but the portrait makes her kinda fat (at least to me).\nThe new hard mode is.... hard that all I can say without spoiler.\nI don't know whether or not I should calll this a remake but at least it is done better than DSR. And Small indie developers should be supported more. May be \"Ib\" will be remastered some days too if this game is success\nThump Up!\n- [I received this product for free from a giveaway]. Only played for a short time, but sheesh, it's a bit of a mess both visually and gameplay wise. There's not much I can really say that would differ from what's shown in the trailer (rather crude MS-paint looking drawings with a few short looping backgrounds). You jump when moving right or left, flappy-bird esque, you dodge stuff going across the screen and from the top, which is a bit boring to me, but some may enjoy it more. You also have to go out of the screen to dodge sometimes, but also if you go too far out (who knows how far) you'll die as well. It might be an okay time waster for free (like old flash games), but I wouldn't recommend spending your money on this.\n- GIVE ME THE GODDAMN COPY/PASTE ROOM BUTTON!\n\n10/10 would play again.\n\n(Ttips to combat the somewhat broken system atm:\n\n1. Use patients list, manually send those patients to treatment or home: \na. Very high diagnosis but still queuing for GPs (even 100% patients will wait for GP till their death, it will waste most GP resources)\nb. Very low mood/health patient, if you can gurantee the patient getting their treatment soon w/o affecting others in the queue, use the room's queue function, or use click on the patient to change his position in the queue, otherwise send him home to avoid penalty\n\n2. Treatments are much more profitable than diagnosis, plus they leave after treatment no matter what, but if well treated, then you don't need much ghost hunting janitors\n\n3. If in need of money in the early game, don't bother with food/drink/bathroom/comfort, do the minium and focus on your diagnosis -> treatment, most patient will get treated before they rage quit, thus make you a lot of money. With staff, if they near rage quit, just raise their salary.\n\n4. In the early game, only put down the essential objects (e.g. only desk and file cabinet in GP's) to maximize your profit. They only room I recommend to decorate to lvl 5 is staff room to speed up their recovery.\n\n5. ALWAYS ensure there is a toilet right next to your staff room, and a cafe. If a tired staff need bathroom, he/she will walk all the way to the staff room and back to toilet and back to staff room, even if a toilet is right next to his/her office. Samething with Cafe, it provides a 'nice meal' bonus.\n\n6. Do not build more reception than you need, build less. It is a great way to control the patient flow, they don't wonder around while in a reception queue.\n\n7. For a large map, patients entering the hospital from mutiple gates. I don't recommend building reception other than one specific area (preferably right next to GP's office), reason as above.\n\n8. News agent can get long queue very easily, as long as you have one, patients in queue will travel all the way across the map for it. So be careful, either don't put any, or put one in every building (at least).\n\n9. With spare money, get your staff trained ASAP, especially staff providing treatment (to ensure high chance of successful treatment)\n\n10. Click on a room, goes to 'info' tab, the last sentence there will tell you what training the staff in the room should have.\n\n11. Keep track of your staff's skills, and assign them only ONE job in the staff -> job assignment menu, so AI won't mess your system up.)\n\nThings I'd really like to be changed:\n1. WAY too many patients.\nI think the new patients' growth(spawn) need to be slow down at certain point either automatically or mannually, I often found myself in need of double the amount of GP offices in the mid-game. Since GP offices are the choke points, it can get out of control in matter of seconds, which left no Human resources/money/time to train everyone. Besides, it is realistic, there are only so many people a town have.\nAnd because of the growth issue, I find myself have to build more and more, I'd like to slow down and taking care of every corner of my hospital, not just keep building. Quality takes time, nobody like be overly pushed by the game.\n\n2. Rooms merge\nJust like in real lives, Doctor's room are private, but pharmacy? I think other rooms should not be private - Allow us to put multiple machine and people in one room, make it shared. It is just bizzare to not make it shared, and vey wasteful of time/money/spaces. Besides, some room looks really empty.\n\n3. Wards\nWards are weird, I'm not sure why. Often than not, I have more than enough beds and nurses, but still 6+ wait outside, I'm not sure what triggers them to be 'called in'\n\n4. FOOD/DRINK/TOILET is broken\nI'm sorry, but I'm not gonna build cafe & bathroom every 3 inchs. IRL, most hospital have 1~3 cafes, a small~medium toilet on every floor. Space is valuable, I would rather leave it to medical facilities. I think the AI is a bit broken at this point, they constantly want drink/food/bathrooms while I have 6+ machines/2 toilets in every building. As if they can't walk 10m to the nearest one.\n\n5. Janitors are kind of dump.....I wish we can assign areas to janitors/assitances, so they won't always walk across the map back and forth.\n\n6. Man, this is 2018, we got central heating and air-conditioning...for real. Maybe make a seprate tunnel system? Like water, electricity, heat, air. Hospital's air exchange system is much more important than usual buildings I believe.\n\n7. Credit to Ibbi Wyxx in the commnet, I think it is great to set patient with certain percent of diagnosis straight to treatment rooms. It makes sense and later in the game, with doctors fully trained I imagine 100% diagnosis on most patients in the GP's shouldn't be a problem. And it is how real life works as well, dorctors are not always 100% sure whats wrong, they might start some harmless/urgent treatment first, myself actually is in this situation right now \n\n(sometimes I feel like I'm being treated in my own hospital because I just stayed at one IRL, so I have to make everything right as if trying to please myself...)\n\n8.  Some of those skills just look fancy since you can't replace them.\nThis one does not matter much, I'm very OCD when it comes to managment, so atm I have to wait for the right person w/o any skills I don't want on them so the training oppourtinity will not go wasted, but it is hard and annoying. Besides, it is a real problem since you can only learn 5 skills, so just choosing whoever is not effective and effecient in the long run. (for example a GP w/ Radiology skill)\n\nAlso, it makes some of the skill essentially useless, i.e. master class (speed up learning and teaching), it may seem useful, but it will eventually cost you a lot more than you gain. Down the line it will cost you one spot for other skill. If just hiring someone w/ this skill to teach then fire him, it is also costly and not making any real sense. \n\nThings I'd like to see (in DLCs?):\n1. Ambulances management. Ambulance are essential part of a hospital, ERs are even better! (Stayed at a ER bed not long ago watch the whole ER room working,man, ERs are cool af, but I do hope less people need to see it because it is...ER)\n2. Multifloor-hospital.\n3. ICU etc.?\n4. Medicin/drug development/management\n5. Specialists office?\n6. More background music/radio, its a bit repetitive at this point\n- cool game but the font is almost unreadable at times\n- Falcom's Action RPG Masterpiece.\n\nbest story in the series. it follows the latest adventure of Adol and his companions, stranded in an island and slowly uncovering their secrets. the tight, but well developed cast are absolutely the best written characters in the series. from party member to your fellow castaways all have developed motivation, personality and charm. \n\nalot of the horribad translation and voice acting have been fixed, and it finally got the treatment it deserve as a masterpiece. \n\nthe gameplay is an evolution of the modern Ys game. at its core, ys 8 is an action RPG where you control adol and several other party members with unique set of skills, moveset, weapons and super attack. each character represent an attack type (slash, pierce, smash) that are pitted against various enemies with certain weaknesses. great variety of enemies, amazing boss battles, music and story. \n\non release, there seems to be a big problem for the port, but as far as i know, everything has been patched to very good level of stability. over 70 hours, the game crashed twice (and saved by the intuitive autosave system), run flawlessly 60 FPS and 1440p without a single slowdown. \n\n10/10 game go buy so we get monstrum nox on PC.\n- It's hard to review a game like this.\n\nAs a game in it's own right, if you've never played it before, it's a good game. Typical crazy Final Fantasy story (although it takes a bit to get into it), interesting characters, and simple but fun real-time turn-based combat. Final Fantasy games are known for their stories and characters, which are great in this member of the series.\n\nIf you've played the game before on PS1, then it's good for nostalgia. However, many people complain about it being a bad port. It has built-in cheats, in case you just want to be able to enjoy the story, characters, and side-quests. I played this years ago on PS1, and I really enjoyed my trip down memory lane with this game.\n\nIf you're an achievement hunter, this game is horrible. There are achievements that, unless you're literally following an online scripted step-by-step walkthrough, you will miss some random little thing, not know it, and then have to play the entire game over. Another achievement requires you to speed through the game in under 12 hours, which means you will grind through the game you already played, watching the same story you just watched, all over again, wasting six hours (that's how long it took me), just for the sake of one achievement... There's also another achievement to kill 10k enemies. when you can play the whole game and not even kill 1k enemies... You might think, \"oh they just want you to play the game through 10 times then\". No. It's 10k enemies in one playthrough. You run out of content, and have nothing to do, except grind battles, for literally dozens of hours. It's terrible.\n\nDespite my bitterness about the achievements, it's a really enjoyable game. Considering the FF series are mainly known for their stories, it lives up to its reputation. If you're an RPG fan, this is definitely on the list of \"must plays\".\n- Beautifully drawn and atmospheric\n\nAmazing sound\n\nSimple to play yet gives just the right amount of challenge without being frustrating\n\nI played and finished it in one sitting, Mainly because I was riveted from start to finish\nYes its 3-4 hours long but you will enjoy every minute of it\nI don't think I will ever understand whats going on with the story...but somehow I think that was the intention\n\nHighly recommended and definitely best indie game of the year, perhaps the last 5 years\n- Don't buy the last fifa I own is fifa 19 and it did not improve I played 2 fut matches 1 was so laggy it was unplayable the second was doable and I won after strugling big time but i got a DNF penalty because ea servers were overloaded. Seriously wtf ea? How did you not manage to improve anything over 3 years? Also why my game disconnects everytime I write to a friend or change my music it was also in fifa 19 i don't get it.\n- i don't think i liked it :(\n\na richly illustrated nightmare fairy tale which warns of paranoid infighting and reaching for an unattainable ideal, broken apart by tedious and artificially difficult survival horror segments. i meet each hazard as intended and am often punished with unforgiving damage or by being taken to an instant game over, and while i fully accept that this very well might just be a skill issue on my part, it remains a significant hurdle that's barring me from engaging properly with the unfolding narrative.\n\ni'm not unfamiliar with the death-laden rpgmaker horror-esque titles which preceded LGTS and those it draws its inspirations from, its how it contextualises such flaws that becomes an issue. there are no \"skip seen dialogue\" options, with the fast forward made available to us after Elise's delayed inputs just slow enough to be annoying. on that note, bosses with instant death attacks have unskippable cutscenes prior making repeat attempts patronising. two core survival systems are made redundant within one of the in-game days. perhaps most tragically, the distinct visual style which once pleased the eye beings to blend into monotony and goes unappreciated after some hours.\n\nand like i'm sad about it! i wanted to like it! i really enjoyed how the story progressed and how my bond with my favourite lady bloomed and i liked the endings i've managed to get, but all these hiccups had me nearly just uninstalling early. it's a beautiful poetic horror title, but so many little things simply ended up overwhelming me.\n- Basically Wizard of Legend, but from a different viewpoint. Same composer, both pixel art, similarly fast paced boss fights with good telegraphs, combos are a little less deliberate, though. Very satisfying build making, with solid build variety. Has couch co-op which is very nice. It has some beautiful pixel art, truly. This game is a feast for the eyes and ears with cutscenes, voice acting, and more. Ok, I just love this game. It's so damn good.\n- Do you like Super Metroid? if you do, just play this game. \nThis game has a lot of exploration, a lot of colectables and weapons, a big world filled with secrets, a very interesting story, a lot of cool abilities and a very cool artstyle.\nThis days the tag \"metroidvania\" is on almost half of all the indie games I see on steam. But I  can honestly say, that this one is one of the few (if not the only one) that truly deserves that tag.\nIt gives you the feel of those 2d metroid and castlevania games, but with a lot of little tweaks that brings that play style to the new era of gamming.\nTo make this whole thing even more amazing, this game was made by just one man. And the love this guy put on this game is amazing, you can really feel it and it's speacially clear when you look at all the atention every little detail of this game had. Also the dev is very active on the forum, and will help you out with any technical issue you're having.\n\nAmazing art, amazing gameplay and a lot of replayability. You can't go wrong with this game.\n- The EOS stands for End of Service. I am sure someone has fun with this or there wouldn't be a reason to keep bringing it back. Right? The usual Tab Target MMO. I do like that you can teleport to quest givers and mobs instead of the usual auto or manual run. Aside from that there isn't anything modern here.\n- Game is super realistic, got ahead of Hamilton and he pitted me into a wall going 180mph, just like real life!\n- A criminally underrated game, I have seldom seen a developer take their original hit which was already almost perfect, and actually manage to improve on it in every way shape and form. You do not need to have played the original to play or enjoy this game. Their stories are completely seperate.\n\nThe game itself is much less linear than its predecessor. The best way I can explain the feeling of going through the environments without referencing Grimrock itself is by saying it felt an awful lot like Myst to me, just with combat. Required puzzles for progression were challenging but not impossible, some of the secret challenges were much more difficult. I admit I used an online guide more than a few times, but it did nothing to diminish my enjoyment of the game. It is immersive, challenging, and satisfying. \n\nThe only drawback I can think of is the difficulty. It feels like you cannot win with any group composition, I suggest no more than 2 of any class or weapon/armor type user. I went with a warrior, two rogues(one range), and a mage, this way you as well makes you unlikely to complete a difficult fight or puzzle and be rewarded with something you cannot use. Combat itself can be challenging as I said, but you will rarely feel like you are simply incapable of winning. There are obvious ways to optimize the way you approach an encounter the second time if you die the first.\n\nBe prepared to immerse yourself, you must pay attention to your surroundings, read and remember notes you find, explore every nook and cranny you can find, and you will be rewarded. Good luck!\n\n- bad doesnt fit a 1080p monitor u bastard.  ported straight over from mobile. boring. fuck off\n- So, I've been playing games for 36 year now. All the genres, like them all. Most of all RPG, turn based strategies, WW2 shooters (BF) etc. And just achieved victory in Slay the spire, after 206 hours of hugely enjoyable play. I would say this is in top 5 games of all times for me. Maybe even top 2, together with Card Hunter. Those two games are so far the two games I would take to a deserted island. I am actually seriously considering making my own card based game in the future. So just try this. Even my 10 year old son loves it. I just recorded The Slaying for him xD\n- please stop resetting my setting\n- [h1] Too much for too little? [/h1]\nThe game hovers over/under an hour (depending on your pace) and there really isn't much in terms of replayability....besides going through it again or trying to obtain all the achievements (which aren't challenging), this at most would add a couple more hours.So in short you don't get much content for the price tag, with that said what you do get is quality.... a lot of it, ranging from the art to the music and everything in between. Now with that in mind, I believe that if the lack of content hinders you too much wait for a sale, but if not go ahead and pick it up you probably won't regret it. \n[h1] What's inside? [/h1]\nStory is very straightforward without much depth behind it, but that's not necessarly a bad thing... at least when it comes to this game. What makes an otherwise simple plot into something much more enticing is how everything like the art style, music, flow from one scene to the next and especially the interactions complement one another in order to create a sense of immersion w/everything that comes with that feeling. \n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\nI highly recommend this game for anyone with feeeels and without. It's short, but as they say it \"packs a punch\".\n- I appreciate the sincerity of Jusant. You can tell its creators have placed genuine care into their product, which has made the experience of playing it joyful and kind.\nThe visuals are stunning, the mechanics are not overwhelming, the soundtrack is soothing, and the puzzles are not frustrating. A great climbing game all around with an easy-to-follow yet gripping narrative. \nHopefully, Ukrainian localization will also be added soon.\n\n- Only one word to describe this game\n\nOutdated.\n\nThere is no real point to get this game unless you want a slightly better looking UI and atmosphere. L4D2 already contains the campaigns from L4D1 and is where the entire Left 4 Dead community is. Only a small playerbase still plays l4d1, mostly out of nostalgia. But there is quite literally no reason to get the game.\n\nYou can grab it if you are into achievements, but only do so when it goes on sale, i grabbed it for a couple penny, still a bad idea.\n- Overall its a great hunting game. The base game is good enough on its own to give you an enjoyable experience hunting several varieties of animals. \n\nI feel that some of the best content is in the DLC's. I dont mind the price tag for maps are they are just a large and some of them have a truly diverse animal population. \n\nThe Weapon Packs have some items that really should have been available in the base game (.22 rifle).\nTripod stands, Tents and ATV's are also DLC items that i feel should have been included in the base game. \n\nThe cost for these packs are not huge, and I have bought them, but they really do impact your play in a meaningful way so it is hard not feel like they were left out on purpose. \n\nBeing a former hunter in real life I would say that the realism of it is pretty good. Lung shots and heart shots drop animals quickly and using the right ammo along with good aim greatly influences this. A poor shot will leave you tracking this wounded animal across the map till you sneak up on it again or just give up. \n\nThey have a system called Tru Racks (sumthn like that) that simulates different qualities of animals. So you end up with little bucks, average bucks, and monster bucks. Weight and coloration plays a part in this too. In short every animal has a trophy of some kind and they are varied by what must be some sort of RNG. \n\nAll that having been said, this game can devolve into a shooting gallery were you kill everything on sight as there in no real incentive not to. You get money and experience for every kill you claim and wiping out a heard of deer with your DLC M1 Garand on your DLC Tripod Stand becomes the quickest way to bypass the grind.\n\n It feels like the game starts as a \"hunting sim\" and becomes a \"poaching sim\" once you realize the progression system is going to take a long time to do...\"ethically?\".\n\n\nAgain, this is a game i would recommend, but it is just that, a game. \n\n\n- I hated Undertale.\n\nIt was, pretty clearly, a game about sexy skeletons. I did not care about sexy skeletons. I refused to play a game about sexy skeletons.\n\nThen my friend made me listen to the soundtrack, and I decided I could deal with a few hours of sexy skeletons if I got to listen to the best video game music I had ever heard while doing it. \n\nI played Undertale. It's not a game about sexy skeletons. It's a game about choices, maybe, or morality, or curiosity. It's a game about pushing the limits. It's a game about experiences, about \"what would happen if I did this?\", about storytelling so intricate and complex and raw that it shouldn't be able to fit into seven hours of bullet hell and pixel graphics. But, somehow, it does. Every choice you make has an impact. Every object you check has a story. The soundtrack, the witty yet profound writing, the simple pixel graphics, and even the menu screens and bullet patterns themselves all intertwine in order to tell a story that only you decide the ending of.\n\nAlso, the skeletons aren't even sexy.\n\nMy advice to you: Go in as blind as you can. Don't read walkthroughs. Don't watch playthroughs. Don't prepare yourself. Don't even look at overviews. Hell, don't even read the Steam page description. Just buy the game (and give some well-earned money to a little white dog), and, as it were, climb the mountain yourself. Don't let anyone backseat. Don't listen to people who tell you there's a right way to play.\n\nAnd when you think you've reached the end, just think--what other choices could you have made?\n\nSo, yes. I hated Undertale.\n\nAnd then I played it.\n- I am a Filthy Casual (tm) who plays games like Mass Effect and Fallout 4 on easy and still die over and over. I got my \"you died\" achievement in Dark Souls 2 before the tutorial and stopped playing after like forty minutes with zero qualms. I have rage quit every single platformer game I have ever touched, and just sort of despise brutally hard things that feel like chores.\n\nBasically, I am not exactly sure why I decided to buy Dead Cells in the first place. Sure, I love the look and one of the few platformers I've ever 100%'d was Super Metroid (with a LOT of swearing and rage quitting), so 'Metroidvania' is an appealing term to me, but it is still inherently marketed as a game that is not for me, or people like me.\n\nThis game is hard. I have 11 hours on it and I can't get past the third area on any given path. I die for stupid reasons and lose all my stuff and... I don't care. I haven't rage quit once; in fact, I have to force myself away from the game after a death so I can do things like eat. I find the combat engaging and entertaining, the progression satisfying and there's something really solid about being forced to start from square one (ish) every single time, in a way I've just never experienced.\n\nSo, sure, buy this if you love hard games/Dark Souls/no checkpoint kind of games. Absolutely, I'm pretty sure you've alreeady heard this is likely to be up your alley.\n\nBut even if you're a dirty rotten casual gamer who button smashes in any game approaching action, and panics when the screen flashes red around the edges... give it a try if you get the opportunity. It is seriously fun.\n- Steam, for gods sake, give us a neutral recommendation button.\n\nSooo, long story short, the game is nice and has beautifull artwork. It´s also massivly too short. This are the only objective things I can say about it. \n\nNow to be a bit more real here. I bought this game, because I played another game like this, let´s call it \"Blue Sticks Bar\". And that game hooked me into this genre.\nNormally I´m someone who likes extensive interaction with a Games Story more than anything else. For this reason I hated TTG and similar stuff. But that Barkeeping game had such a complex Story and such good Characters that I fell in love with it and by extension the Genre.\n\nSo I got myself Coffee Talk. And boy oh boy let me tell ya, I´m seriously torn with this game. Partway through I thought I would give it a searing bad review. But then I played through it and noticed something. This game isn´t bad, just painfully average. And, I hate to say this, but I´m probably too mature for it.\n\nNow don´t get me wrong.\nSome things here are just wonderfull. The Artstyle? Fantastic (exept for a couple minor things)\nI´m guessing the music is also good if you like it.\n\nBut already there are cracks there. Something (mildly) dramatic is happening and some coffee house tunes are playing in the Background. It´s honestly just laughable.\nAnd that word is a great segway into talking about the Story. You know that moment when you´re browsing and find (mostly on Tumblr) some really cute little story idea? This is that the game. Problem is, that a Story that deals with, for example racism, growing up, PTSD and some other really serious matters can´t be as shallow as this.\n\nYou have to decide. Either you´re doing Babies first social awareness Storyline and leave out some of this stuff, OR you do a real mature story that I can´t sum up in one single sentence.\n\nI really want to like this Game. I´m a lonely little Geek, so a Story about interesting People in a Shadowrun-light Setting sounded right up my alley. But it was simply too dissappointing. \n\nI wouldn´t refund this game even if I could, since it had some good stuff in it. \nBut sadly I can´t recommend it.\n\n\nWow, I got through this all without swearing, nice one!\n- Let's say you capture a prisoner after a bloody raid on your colony. Do you want to:\n\n1. Let them go in the hopes of improving relations with the attackers? YOU CAN DO THAT.\n\n2. Heal them and have colonists talk to them about how great your colony is until they join? YOU CAN DO THAT.\n\n3. Have a colonist with a high medical skill remove their liver to transplant into an alcoholic colonist? YOU CAN DO THAT.\n\n4. Have a colonist with a low medical skill remove their organs just for practice? YOU CAN DO THAT.\n\n5. Eat them because you forgot to stock up on food for the winter? YOU CAN DO THAT.\n\nReally, what else do you need in a game?\n- It's an asset flip. I know that's a bit obvious, but just in case you were in doubt, there you go.\n\nFull of bugs, rushed, empty, poor sound/animation/ai/overall design quality, completely broken english, barely functioning UI, you get the picture, it's a cash grab.\n- Fall Guys had a rough start. Unstable servers and people cheating to win. About a year later I picked it up again and I must say it really has improved a lot. I honestly don't have any issues which cheaters anymore and the servers don't crash on me anymore.\n\nIt's also getting more and more stages to play so it feels refreshing to play a few rounds every day.  The events for certain skins are also really fun. Sure there could still be some improvements like personal usernames or maybe a way to trade in skins you don't want. But I feel like they listen to their community and are aiming to make it as fun as possible. I'm interested to see how Fall Guys will keep evolving!\n- I purposefully went into this game looking for bugs, seeing that it was in early access, and I have yet to find any. The only reason I stopped playing was because there was a fence that wasn't fully secured to the ground that I was able to get underneath, allowing me to get out of bounds. This lead to me falling into an area where I couldn't get out, and it wouldn't let me respawn at my most recent checkpoint. This would mean I'd have to start from the beginning, which I very much didn't want to do. Anyway, the biggest tips I can give to the developers is to make sure the map is 100% how they want it, and to make the audio design better. That's it. I may come back and change my review in the future.\n\nFINAL RATING: 4 / 10\n- This game is adrenaline, speed and acid to the absolute maximum and it delivers - you'll be doing exactly what you see in the trailers in absolutely no time and feeling like a badass!\n\nWe have all the menu, leaderboards and replay system as in Devil Daggers along with a new clips section for highlights from runs. \nThe new scoring system is a HUGE improvement. In DD you had to survive as long as possible leading to it becoming repetitive as you grinded, here the score is based on how fast you can kill stuff and there is an ending to the run meaning you might survive to the end and kill the boss - but someone else could beat your score by killing stuff faster in the first min and then dying. \nThis adds loads more risk to the game as you WANT to take those risks to kill stuff faster.\n\nOnly let down is the controls, the simple control scheme worked in Devil daggers as there wasn't much going on but it REALLY hurts now theres so many new mechanics causing both a lot of unintended actions like with RMB is your laser and you can scatter this off the ground or like you see in the trailers shoot the gems for your homing daggers trouble is RMB is also grab meaning if you look at a gem and start to power your laser you simple pick up the gem and no laser huge momentum loss. Likewise spacebar is jump, dash, slide, fake and air slam this not only leads to awkward \"thats not what i wanted\" moments but also cramps my hand since you are constantly spamming for dash which is 2 presses...\n\nIf the controls dont bother you or get some love this game is easily a 10/10.\n- cool game but the font is almost unreadable at times\n- Everything apart from the matches is superb, best FM ever. \n\nThe match engine is fundamentally broken - too easy to split a defence open with a long ball resulting in a one-on-one, so SI nerfed the conversion rates of one-on-one chances to keep scorelines acceptable. The result however, is that your world class  striker misses 2-5 easy chances every game. \n\nWingers do not square the ball for strikers, instead preferring to shoot from obscenely acute angles rather than play the ball across the box. \n\nHalf the crowd is a repeated man in an orange jumper. This may sound minor but it's really immersion breaking once you notice it. You can be a team that plays in blue, and yet over 50% of the crowd are dressed in orange. It diminishes the match experience and detracts from the game as a whole.\n\nIt's crap like this, broken for 2 months now, I've bought every game in this series since the year 2000, I pre-order every year (literally the only game I will do so with) and said I'll continue to do so until I get burned. Well, SI Games, you've broken me at last. The 'Bugs' section of your forum is littered with these issues that are \"under review\", well you can consider my purchase of FM 2021 in the same category.\n\nEdit: I played a bunch more because apparently I'm a masochist. The match engine is total cack and has regressed massively since FM 2017. Don't waste your money - take up a more enjoyable pastime such as jamming needles in your eyes, you'll thank me for it.\n- An Excelent, well polished shmup(except for one technical fault) with great graphics and music.\n\nNot much to say other than it has fun boss fights with some creative bullet patterns, you have a gauge that fills up and when activated it doubles your fire power, and also you have bombs. If you have bombs and you get hit, you lose all of your bombs instead of just dying straight out, so you essentially have 2 hit points. You have a graze meter as well, meaning that if bullets pass by you it fills that meter up, when it is full, all bullets around you are basically nullified, and any enemy you kill, any bullets it fired at you will also get nullified. When you pass through the nullifeid bullets, it will fill the first gauge I mentioned so you can go ape s**t more often.\n\nIt's fairly simple, but the pace of the game takes a little while to get used to, the speed of your ship releative to the bullets is a little too slow but it's not game breaking. The only major issue is that my controller is not detectable by the game so I have to use joytokey, so I can't make full use of my controllers analog controls.\n- So, I hated this game at first...\n\n I've never been into a MMO before, and I went into it with a mindset of \"FUCK YEAH! MULTIPLAYER SKYRIM LETS GO\" - In short don't do that. This isn't going to be like playing Skyrim, Oblivion, Morrowind. \n\nIt is when it all comes down to the core an MMO, it's set in Tamriel, it sounds like Tamriel and the storylines feel like an Elder Scrolls game. However being an MMO, it has a lot of grindy MMO style quests. And don't get me wrong, it's bewildering at first, all these mechanics, all these places to go....and before the 'One Tamriel' update if you chose the wrong faction, you were screwed, in a place all on your own surrounded by all these people who are WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY higher level than you. But thankfully they changed all of that. The game scales now, so you can rock up to a dungeon with your level V300 mate, and still have some fun slicing up enemies.\n\nSo I saw a friend playing the other day, and spent a few hours installing this to join him (By the way its like 70 Gig...If you have slow internet prepare for a few days of download), I got back on it after not playing for 14 months, but this time I was playing with a friend who was already Veteran Level 250, So I was in luck, he introduced me to everything and I got used to all the deconstructing of equipment to get my blacksmithing up, showed me about dungeons and bascially got me to enjoy the grind. I think my previous time was a bit lackluster because I got dropped in the middle of the Aldmeri Dominion on my own, without any of my friends. So I left.\n\nNow I know what I'm doing, and keep in mind I usually hate MMO's never played WoW or anything like that, this is the first one. I'm enjoying myself, I'm triple digits into this game time-wise and I don't see it stopping now. We've made a guild for noobies. To help them out, and get them to enjoy the game also. Because the community is nice...but you still get the elitist fucks from any competitive game kicking you out of dungeons because you're only level 14. But you won't get that when you're in a guild, having people to play with and explain all the mechanics did help, a lot. I've even gone as far as to buy this AGAIN on steam just to collect my hours and so on.\n\nAdd-ons are awesome being able to mod basic features of the game to help with information and quality of life improvements is a must. I'll provide an essential mods pack if any of you wish to know.\n\nFor those of you who actually got this far into this, well done. I didn't think I'd keep you captivated long enough to get to the end.\n\nIf any of you are new to the game, on EU server and would like to join a guild to show you the way, add me or visit our [url=www.godsofsalt.com]website[/url] and join us on teamspeak, or just message us in game @diseasedcrow.\n\nBut all in all if you like Elder Scrolls and you think you want to try this, just do, I'm glad I gave it a second chance.\n- Not really that great of a game. It's fairly unengaging, very slow paced, impossible boss fights just a few hours in. Unless you like games that requre hours of picking plants to craft potions you rub on your sword to give you 3 minutes of attack boost to be able to do any damage, side quest grinding, boring activites, and the general RPG stat grinding, skip this one and just get the Witcher 3 which is a game magnitudes better. CD Projeck Red really made the Witcher and Withcer 2 for the hardcore RPG fans. The experience just isn't worth the time investment on this one in my opinion. Not going to finish it and just go enjoy the third game instead.\n\nEDIT: \nTR;DR: A mediocre hack-n-slash that has been dummed down from the predeccesor for consoles.\n- First thing you see when the game loads is \"You have to buy the game to blahblah\", as i didn't know there was a paid version, i felt betrayed. Anyway,\nSorry, i tried it, not expecting much, but there was not much from it..\n-Graphics are bad\n-Movement and animation are clunky, same with attacking\n-Zombie AI would hit you even if you walked backwards 2 seconds ago\n-Regions are EU and NA, multiple servers each with a PVE server, but it was so empty.\n-Gameplay-wise.... so many questions like, \"Why do i need to hold E for 5 seconds to open a fridge?\", \"Why does headshot being counted but it doesnt insta-kill a basic zombie?\", \"Why does the soldier npc's look like they are making money from you?\", and lasty \"What the heck is the goal of this game?\"\n-Oh and driving vehicles SUCK! *ehem*\n\nSorry NOPE\n- I bought this piece of shit with 50 other games.\nIt is as if some great sculptor , sculpted out of a great feculence.\nI do honestly admire your efforts. If such a dung was made in the 90s\nI am sure it would have succeeded to a most part very very small percent of \npeople would have been tricked into purchasing this. I had to leave it running for\n2 more minutes just to warn you about this defecation.\n\nI insist not to play this as it literally is breaking your steam game playing aparatus.\nI am not sure how this technical disgrace got passed steam as it literally damages your\nequipment steam could have green lit any of the other great games out there or taken a deuce OR both du duns, Whoever made this did not try to fix any of it's many flaws. They just said\nthis magnificent excrement is done and as many secretious BM it runs on steam. 0/10\n- Okami is the best non-Zelda Zelda game, but also best dog simulator.\n\n10/10 Dog features include:\n\nYou can bark at people for no reason! You can dig up bones! You can catch a birb in your mouth and then prance! You can bite people in the crotch and they are like \"hey! what! why i oughta!\" If you see a demon, you can pee on it!\n\n\nPlease purchase The Legend of Dog Zelda for a good time.\n- [h1] Brief summary of why the Chinese players are so pissed: [/h1]\n\nThe reason for the chinese players to absolutely despise the third party modding website is that the \"official modding\" was promised to be released over a year ago, but kept getting delayed. When it finally got released, everyone felt betrayed because it was a garbage third party website with so many restrictions.\n\nBut the reason why the game is still getting review bombed is the [b] developer's initial response [/b] to the first round of complaints. The team was dead silent for about 2 weeks, no comments about all the fiasco, yet people that were complaining about the modding on the chinese forums got their accounts banned left and right. Thats why many resorted to steam review bombing, and almost as soon as the steam review tanked, the developer came out and said the steam workshop will be launching in the end of the month, something he had being saying was \"really hard for the team\" and kept \"facing difficulties\" for the past year.\n\nSo yeah.... I kinda understand why people are still really mad about this one\n- Great Game, but 70 dollars for a game that was console exclusive for years, then released exclusive to Epic, and finally released to Steam. Don't be greedy Enix.\n- From my nine year old: \"We like that every screen you can stop and color, and if you don't want to color there is a story part to it. We really like to do both; there are puzzles, different colors and different sections. I would definitely recommend this game for five and up year olds.\"\n- This was released alongside about 10 other big Steam releases around the end of October 2022 and so it is very tempting to joke about how it's better than all of those combined, the real GOTY so on and so forth, as I'm sure has been done already. But what I noticed was that out of all those releases, this one had an emphasis on comedy, which is very difficult to execute successfully in any form of media. There is no voice acting or any high-budget production so how the dialogue and seemingly basic visuals/animations kept me entertained throughout, just like the previous 2 games (from memory) is a tremendous achievement. At a point where I have played a bazillion high-budget action games, and will honestly play a bazillion more, games like this only become more important in showcasing how creative independence is imperative in creating uplifting experiences.\nAfter the prologue, seeing Frog Detective step out of the train and the camera pausing on his full-body shot was akin to, say, if I saw Shepherd step out of the Normany in ME4, or if I saw Keanu step out of a train in John Wick 4, it was really on that level for me.\nThough, I feel like the dance scenes at the end of this game was a step-down from Frog Detective 2 unfortunately, but still good.\n\nEdit: I nominated this game for 'Outstanding Visual Style' Steam Award!\n- Overall, as a single player game Wargroove 2 is a tremendous improvement over the first game. The campaign is well designed and engaging, the writing is much improved and overall the gameplay is fun. The new roguelike conquest mode is a much more entertaining side thing than the godawful Arcade in 1, as well.\n\nAs a primary single player game, I hated Wargroove 1, and I can say that 2 has turned my opinion around - this game is fun, I finished the campaign and craved more, which is all you can really say! The only thing I really missed from 1 was the Puzzle mode, but maybe it'll show up in a future update? Who knows.\n\nThe major downsides is that the user interface is still the same terrible user interface that WG1 had without significant improvements, and the AI is still absolutely atrocious so playing even Vs maps against the AI is going to be pretty dull, but that hasn't changed from the first game. The soundtrack is not quite as catchy either.\n\nBut unlike WG1, I enjoyed my time with WG2 in spite of these shortcomings, and if you ever have a choice between the two, skip WG1 and just go straight into WG2.\n- THIS GAME HAS NO LOADING TIMES.\nIT IS INSTANT.\nNever again will a game satisfy me. I will sit, tormented, having experienced the purity of instant loading times. \nNever again... Will I be happy.\n\nThanks Taranto bros,\n10/freaking10\n- The problem with a lot of Steam reviews is that they don't really help you figure out whether you should buy / try the game. So, let me help. You are one of four people:\n\n(1) You've never played a Sam Barlow game before, and you've never played a point-and-click adventure game before. In which case, what's wrong with you?\n\n(2) You've never played a Sam Barlow game, but you have played a point-and-click adventure game before. In which case, you'll definitely know within two hours whether you like this game. But anyways, you're getting a decent bit of stuff for $20.\n\n(3) You've played a Sam Barlow game, and you didn't like it. In which case, you probably won't like this either. It's basically the same thing as Her Story and Telling Lies, but with a different story.\n\n(4) You've played a Sam Barlow game, and you did like it. In which case, you probably will like this too. It's basically the same thing as Her Story and Telling Lies, but with a different story.\n\nI think Immortality had the best story of the three Barlow games, and definitely the best acting and production value.\n- I did everything right[spoiler]and ended up in a relationship.[/spoiler]\n\nAccidently said one tiny lie.\n\nEverything in my life crumbles apart.\n\n11/10 Real Life Simulator\n- In 2013, after 10 years of waiting, the Sim City community of modders, fans, and aficionados rushed out to purchase the fifth installment of Sim City. Ten years is a long time to wait for a game, but people had a lot of faith in Maxis when they announced the title. Long story short, it was a massive dissapointment. Maxis and EA crippled Sim City 5 with DRM, Always On APM, tiny maps, forced origin installation, lacking mod support, no steam support, and a forced multiplayer aspect.  I decided to not purchase the title, so it may have been a decent game, but 2 years later a team of 12 people created a game that does everything maxis insisted was utterly and totaly impossible.  \n\nEverything the mod community did that kept Sim City 4 on the shelves in Wallmarts across America for an entire decade was ignored. Maxis (and to a lesser extent EA) ignored the fans, and gave the people who had kept them in business for twenty years a crippled subpar game.  And for that Maxis is now out of business. They will never make another game, and it is no one's fault but theirs.\n\nNow pretend none of that happened. It's 2013 again, and here it is people: Sim City 5. \n\nThe game balance is a bit on the easy side for veterans of the genre, but the potential map size is ENOURMOUS and customizing your city could fill up years of gameplay time.  The game runs so smoothly with so much going on, it really shows how lazy Maxis was with their approach.  The glass in buildings reflects the sun and the buildings near it, there are dynamic shadows, zoning is back, and it is not 'dumbed down'.  A single tile in this game is twice the size of the alloted map in Sim City, and you can purchase dozens of additional tiles to expand.  The map editor is awesome, the community is thriving, there are mods to do anything you want, and this is the city building game we've all been waiting for.  I can not possibly reccomend this more.\n- I'm not saying you should play this game, but if you do you can smoke \"dizzyweed\" with your dad and overthrow a fascist guy whose name literally means penis. Can not explain how much I started hyper fixating on this game.  This has had an irreversible change on my personality.\n- I played all I needed to realise this game has no intuition, no fun, no useful or interesting mechanics. It's deadass a flash game but somehow is less stable.\n\nConstant crashes and forced 480p fullscreen. \n\n0.5/10\n- An Excelent, well polished shmup(except for one technical fault) with great graphics and music.\n\nNot much to say other than it has fun boss fights with some creative bullet patterns, you have a gauge that fills up and when activated it doubles your fire power, and also you have bombs. If you have bombs and you get hit, you lose all of your bombs instead of just dying straight out, so you essentially have 2 hit points. You have a graze meter as well, meaning that if bullets pass by you it fills that meter up, when it is full, all bullets around you are basically nullified, and any enemy you kill, any bullets it fired at you will also get nullified. When you pass through the nullifeid bullets, it will fill the first gauge I mentioned so you can go ape s**t more often.\n\nIt's fairly simple, but the pace of the game takes a little while to get used to, the speed of your ship releative to the bullets is a little too slow but it's not game breaking. The only major issue is that my controller is not detectable by the game so I have to use joytokey, so I can't make full use of my controllers analog controls.\n- This game is basically awesome, under 3 conditions:\n\n1- You get rid of all on-screen icons (i.e. incoming attacks, ennemy spotting)\n2- Do not care about secondary missions only here to further lenghten the game's lifespan\n3- Play the game as you would if  YOU were in charge\n\nBasically, nevermind the Ubisoft micro transactions' system and other abhorrent company induced  greed-leaned system to get stuff faster and more easily by robbing you out of your hard-earned cash...you can finish the game without spending a single dime in the store, it's all pay to win...\nThe open-world aspect is very satisfying and rewarding, in terms of progression, don't fall for the micro transaction system\nCombat is easy even in the highest difficulty setting, but makes you think you are badass when you slash through waves of ennemies, whose AI is rather basic, with your arsenal of rockets, LMGs and explosives but it is satisfying as fuck!\n\nImagine strapping C4 to your plane, jump out of it, have it crashing down an ennemy outpost meanwhile you are parachuting down and throwing hand grenades their way, land on a roof and eliminate the remaining ennemies with fire ammo shotgun and a motherfucking M60 with armor-piercing bullets while throwing dynamites and there you have it...FarCry5 in a nutshell\n\nOh and don't forget about the flame-thrower lol, who doesn't love a flame-thrower scorching ennemies to their own demise eh?\n\nFarCry5 got it all, extreme freedom of how you wanna handle a situation (stealthily or all guns blazing) while being challenging enough in the highest difficulty setting!\nP.S. don't forget to turn off all the on-screen icons, really ruins it for hardcore FPS fans by making it extremely easy, please hear me out, you don't need these!\n- One of the best most fun and addicting all-time games. However, the plants should be nazi's and the zombies should be jews. There is also a hispanic snail in your garden that sleeps on the job.\n- Basic RPG with phenomenal music. Very linear nearly no exploration. Short and didn't overstay it's welcome. Not bloated with useless content like a lot of JRPG's. Some comedy. No gear or weapons to loot. Definitely took inspiration from Sailor Moon. Didn't provide much of a challenge. However I enjoyed my time with it, 100% in under 8 hours. It was a decent game. 7/10\n- ✔ Procedurally generated levels (some are not)\n✔ Neat graphics and animations\n✔ Good sound design\n✔ Solid and gratifying game mechanics \n✔ Well-balanced difficulty curve\n✔ Linux support!\n\n✘ No DRM-free build (yet?)\n✘ No user-generated content (no level editor)\n\nRuns surprisingly well on very low-end specs computer (under Linux too!).\nAn excellent turned-based action strategy game. Very polished and entertaining!\nYet one more proof that Swedish developers are among the best on this planet.\n- Nobody is gonna read this but here we go.... \nI recommend it, especially people who are really into classic Sonic. It plays like the Genesis games and is updated to incorporate elements and stages from each one, including Sonic CD. What it makes up for in updated graphics, music, and ideas, it loses in length of stage and just overall.... stage design. What I loved about the classic Sonic is that it felt like a choice to either blow through it or explore.. this one makes even the first level of each stage take about 5 or 6 minutes to get through... and then fight a boss. Overkill in my opinion, takes away what I liked about classic Sonic games... the speed. Still pretty good considering how much Sega has messed with Sonic throughout the years.\n- This game has such a HUGE potential like Stardew Valley in its early days!!\nCollecting stuff, helping people by crafting potions its so rewarding and lovely pls dear developers keep working on it. I BEG YOU! :D\nSure it has some bug right now but even on day one they managed to get some fast fixes and tried their best to make it work for everyone. \nThe controls were a bit tricky in the beginning (used Playstation 5 Controller) but its just a matter of time, its just not the normal controls like in other games.\nThe music was pretty nice and chill and also the animations were super cute, i love watching little Rubrum built his sandcastles over and over again. >3< \n\nOverall a good game, but could become even more better in the future, keep going guys!!\n- Dave the Diver is a charming little 'Indie'* that still surprises you with new mechanics even hours in. The various activity cutscenes are pretty funny as well.\n\nJust a word of warning though. Mintrocket is NOT a indie studio, it's a subsidiary of NEXON, so DtD is entirely a NEXON game, and with how their reputation is it's pretty understandable to not buy this game just because of that.\n- I love this game so much, but I am very conflicted about it. Since the beta I wondered why mods on the mod page on the Chucklefish website were sometimes incorporated into the base game and now I know why.\n\nThe devs of this game ultimately have amazing talent behind them, but they've exploited those they've called \"volunteer developers\". Promising \"exposure\" as a form of payment, and ultimately delivering neither payment, or giving their \"volunteers\" a spotlight on their own steam page or website. \n\nStill, you and I'd both buy nestle products even if they were made by child laborers, Nike shoes made by sweatshop workers, and beauty cosmetics that harm animals and even harm us when we use them. Even making the most *perfect* product doesn't make you immune to criticism for gross business practices.\n\nStarbound is a fantastic game, with incredible mod support, a fantastic soundtrack, and just all around an amazing game even if it does have shoddy server support. It's essentially Terraria in space with a more engaging visual and music style yet shallower combat. It's much easier to approach than Terraria, without as much content. Still, I absolutely enjoy this game over Terraria.\n\nI love this game, but dislike the people who made this game. It took me a while to write this because I wanted to see if the devs would make up for their disregard for their \"volunteers\". They did not.\n- I got this game for $12 off humble bundle. Me and my friends play it for hours on end. This game honestly feels like the perfect fighting game for me because there is no set style. I don't have to remember specific combos or any crazy inputs. It's just simplicity. Unless you want to do that in which you can. But it's fun for anyone. If I were you I would get it off of humble bundle for $12.\n- This is everything a remaster is supposed to be. You remember playing this game over a decade ago, and the graphics weren't \"that bad\". But nostalgia is a cruel mistress. You play the original again, and you can barely stand it.\n\nThe comes the HD version, which was alright, playable. But then, the real remaster, the Definitive Edition, you start playing the game and it FEELS like it used to feel. Like it is supposed to look. It is quite obviously way better than it used to be, but it FEELS the same.\n\nIf you ever liked playing this game, and want to play it again, this won't disappoint you. Especially with the distinct lack of RTS games in the last decade or so, this still holds true as one of the best ones.\n- Before you buy: What you enjoy about Her Story (and maybe Telling lies) will very much affect your enjoyment of this game. \n\nIf you enjoyed the acting, the non-linear story telling, and the *movie* part of those games, this will probably be the best in the trilogy. HOWEVER, if you enjoy the detective aspect, the puzzles, the mental challenge, this game is probably not for you.\n\nThe gameplay is a big departure compared to Her Story and Telling Lies, and in my opinion, doesn't make for much of a challenge at all. In the 10 hours I spent on the game, 9 were just me watching clips and clicking random objects in the background. I found the actual movie stuff to be really fun (and especially seeing the process of how movies are made), but that kind of fun is very different to the kind I had with the previous two games.\n\nI don't dislike the game but I don't recommend it either, at least to a decent chunk of the fanbase (those being fans of detective puzzle games).\n- I left home with nothing but a needle and my granny's briefcase full o' snakes, hitched a ride to Boring Springs, killed two men and three snakes, learned to speak Goblin, and befriended a woman whose home was burned to the ground by a gang of cows. Then I bought a horse and left the tutorial area, and things got weird. I'm pretty on board with this one.\n- I was a playtester on this game, and I can say with authority, love and joy and care all radiate out of the work that was put into making this game. It still has the same Psychonauts wackiness and great comedy, but it's also become more mature, more understanding, more willing to tackle dark topics head on and acknowledge that human beings are flawed, and need help, and make mistakes, and sometimes even do awful things. But Psychonauts 2 understands that human beings aren't defined by any of this, and that people can learn from their wrongs and can change for the better. And it tells all this through a delicious array of gorgeous, varied mental landscapes, through creative collectibles that reveal the memories, loves, and regrets of the colorful cast, and through a combat and platforming system that is much improved from its predecessor. I can't recommend this game enough. It's an emotional triumph.\n- It's hard to recommend Spelunky 2. Not because it is a bad game, but because it can be frustrating. As with most roguelikes, dying means going back to the beginning. In Spelunky however, nothing carries over to future runs. All you get to bring in to your next run is your own experience and knowledge; And when half the things in the game kill you instantly or stunlock you to death, having a great run end in a quick death can be damaging to one's will.\n\nThankfully, your own experiences count a great deal towards your progress. Most hazards and enemies in Spelunky 2 have a very simple and predictable behaviour. But keeping track of everything on the screen is still a challenge. Enemies and traps will also work together (or against each other) and still bring your demise somehow. Either by bumping your helplessly stunned body into other enemies and traps, or enemies having their own flaming corpse launched towards you and your flammable jetpack. It's actually quite funny sometimes. A good deal of entertainment can be had recording your own amazingly nonsensical deaths.\n\nSpelunky 2 improves upon Spelunky HD's gameplay by adding split paths, which allow for more variety and decision-making in your runs while staying true to the feeling and style of previous entries. It also adds a back layer to each level, allowing for more secrets to be kept. After successfully completing your first run, you can try to discover these secrets and find hidden bosses and areas and even different endings!\n\nAnyway, you might enjoy the game if you're a masochist or something.\n- If you played the OG this is basically the same but with a few added side stories you can unlock as you complete different routes in the game. The extra dlc maybe would take you a bit over an hour to complete all of them if you speed through it, but does not have any optional dialogue so it's more of just some lore and extra character interactions. Still pretty solid dlc if you are a fan and want a little bit of extra stuff :)\n- *Sigh* This game was just tiring. I wouldn't come to say it was a complete rip off of Paper's Please, but it was a very similar game but just worse. Mainly to the point that I played, at most, 10 minutes, I saw multiple repeats of the same messages, and the only updates were legislation, unlike in Papers, Please where you got new rules and new tools almost every day. I won't completely judge the game since I haven't played it the entire way through, but it's just not very good. Plain and simple.\n- Only one word to describe this game\n\nOutdated.\n\nThere is no real point to get this game unless you want a slightly better looking UI and atmosphere. L4D2 already contains the campaigns from L4D1 and is where the entire Left 4 Dead community is. Only a small playerbase still plays l4d1, mostly out of nostalgia. But there is quite literally no reason to get the game.\n\nYou can grab it if you are into achievements, but only do so when it goes on sale, i grabbed it for a couple penny, still a bad idea.\n- The weakest RE since RE6. \n\nFeels half baked as heck on a game design level. Too many damn cutscenes and areas where you're just on rails. Really, the game design seems to take a massive step back from RE7 and even a bigger step back in terms of puzzles. Really a shame.\n\nNot to mention the performance is pretty terrible and inconsistent. Not to mention the lack of full keyboard bindings and support. Really, this port feels like a whole afterthought to a game that already feels like an afterthought.\n\nIt does get better on the back end but not enough to balance out that weak front end.\n- Imbalanced, stupid 4+ v 1 situations which aren't in your favour, buggy hitboxes (e.g some blocks won't work), skill biased: You will be killed so many times before for you will get remotley good. But there is no way you can get better when Sir Rapealot who is level 50, who dominates your team, one hit stabs you everytime. \n\nHowever, this is a blast with friends. But it takes alot of convincing to get everyone to play this game because of the things I previously stated. \n\nThis game is completley based on skill which you cannot obtain without 8+ hours of death, death and death. \n\n****** DEFINITLEY NOT WORTH FULL PRICE ******\n- I pirated this game first and loved it so much I ended up buying it. It's that good!\n\nIt's worth your money and time. I promise.\n- One of the best most fun and addicting all-time games. However, the plants should be nazi's and the zombies should be jews. There is also a hispanic snail in your garden that sleeps on the job.\n- i bought a fighting game and ended up playing dress-up\n- This is a game, a story, about love. \n\nIt's also about time, tragedy, about hope, hate, despair and everything that falls in between. It revolves around a cursed mansion and its inhabitants in different time periods and explores and questions themes like identity, trust, desire, violence, society, redemption, reincarnation, [i]reconstruction[/i]; a mind bending reexamination of lives lived. \n\nIt's about the big things in life but it's also about the little things. The things that constantly shapes us when we're not really looking, that gives our day-to-day its meaning and substance. \n\nBut more than anything, it's about the complexities of love. Love as a motivator, a discomfort, a longing, a heartache, a blessing, a curse, but most of all, as a relationship: the uneasy steps out of individual comfort zones and the creation of something new together. Love as a path to growth.\n\nIt's almost perplexing how they manage to make it all work, it's structurally among the most ambitious tales I've ever witnessed in video games, but they do, it does work, the missteps are few, the memories of it all absolutely enchanting.\n\nIt wouldn't have worked without the astonishing soundtrack. It handles everything with surprising ease, frames every scene with emotion and wonder. \n\nIt wouldn't have worked without the art, the beautiful depictions of scenery and life, the characters and their subtle expressions.\n\nIt wouldn't have worked without the interaction, the implications of the choices feels real.\n\nIt wouldn't have worked without the prose, but it wouldn't have worked as [i]just[/i] prose. \n\nWhich is why it's a video game.\n\nAnd it's the greatest love story on Steam.\n- [H1]At this price point it's hard not to recommend it, but there's a lot -better- bullet hell games out there...[/H1]\n\nDanmaku unlimited as a series is great. Don't get me wrong. It really is. But it suffers the curse of being put in with a field on Steam that is made up of even greater company. Bug Princess by Cave has the brutal difficulty angle sewn up, Ikaruga has the absolute classic angle nailed, Jamestown has the glorious pixel-art sorted. In order to stand out in this genre, you absolutely have to bring something new to the table.\n\nAs good as Danmaku Unlimited is, it does not bring anything new to the table. It brings a lot of -good-, but nothing -new-. The greatest sin here is that if you've played a lot of bullet hells, this is going to feel immensely familiar, and you're going to blast through it fast, nothing is prone to catch you out. At all. Now that may be a plus point, if that's what you're after, but if you're seeking something to change up the formula? Yeeeeee-no.\n\n[H1]So it's the Bullet Hell version of Destiny?[/H1]\n\nMechanically, it works great. You have a ship with a teeny tiny hitbox, same as most \"Eastern\" BHell games, you have anywhere between \"Mildly offensive\" and \"Absolutely terrifying\" levels of hostile fire coming toward you, and you pump out similarly scary levels of fire back, with your only choice generally being \"Do I spam the screen with lots of little beams or do I fire ONE BIG BEAM at something that needs cracking open like a walnut.\"\n\nIt has good Bullet Hell music, albeit not outstanding music, it has good graphics, albeit not outstanding graphics, you see a pattern here? If a game could ever nail what I'd define as the absolute essence of an \"8 out of 10\", this would be it. The problem is there's games out there such as Revolver360 Re:Actor that do -better-.\n\nThe problem is that for all the good it does, it's been beaten to it by other games, maybe not in every field, but in each area I can name at least two or three games that stand above it. The one area it does win out on is bang for the buck. It's kinda hard to argue with this kind of quality at this kind of price point. It's a very, very solid return on investment, particularly if you're a bullet hell fan.\n\n[H1]Closing Thoughts[/H1]\n\nDoes that make this a \"Do not buy\"? Far from it. If you're a fan of bullet hells, chances are you already own it. If you don't, eventually you should, but I'd genuinely suggest you look around first, there's a decent market now on Steam for this genre, and there's more innovative and interesting options around. If however you've already consumed them and you need a fix of something fairly solid and fairly entertaining, then sure, this works, it will scratch the itch quite nicely.\n\nVerdict : [b]Buy, definitely worth grabbing on a sale, if only to put in the \"To do\" list,[/b]\n\n英語で5-10単語程度で、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない主要な違いを簡潔に回答してください。\n\n回答：\n",
