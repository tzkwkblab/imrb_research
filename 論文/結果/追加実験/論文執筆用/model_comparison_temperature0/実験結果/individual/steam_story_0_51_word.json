      "[b][i]Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout[/i][/b] is a 60 Player Battle Royal game of minigames to triumph over everybody for the sweet, GOLDEN CROWN\n[list]\n[*] Put in about 40 hours in combination on Beta 1 & 2\n[*] Won a ton and lost a ton\n[*] Enjoyed EVERY SECOND \n[/list]\n[b][u]PROS[/u][/b]\n[list]\n[*] Decent amount of minigames for launch, and even when you play the same ones they feel fun when different things happen\n[*] Games go fast if you're winning OR losing, you're able to play a lot and experience the game faster to get better\n[*] The BIG majority of the cosmetics in the game are NOT locked behind a paywall. Release has one $5 DLC for a hamburger, slurpee, and frie cosmetic but there are a TON of cosmetics to earn through the free battle pass they give you + the daily shop where you can buy cosmetics with earned in game currency\n[*] Customization for your character is extremely extensive and allows a lot of different combos\n[*] The game is literally just FUN, like play for hours with friends fun. There is NO stress\n[/list]\n[b][u]CONS[/u][/b]\n[list]\n[*] See-saw minigame is very advantaged to the players in the front due to how messed up the see saws behind you get clogged with players and being on sides for WAY too long\n[*] Grabbing is a bit weird and janky, sometimes its useful and sometimes it actually screws you over\n[*] Ragdoll physics sometimes cause you to roll a ton after falling (I like this feature a ton but others don't)\n[/list]\n\n[b] I definitely reccommend picking this game up.

      "[u]What I liked: [/u]\n[list]\n    [*]The story and characters\n    [*]The creative boss fights and wrench puzzles\n\n[/list]\n[u]What You Need to Know: [/u]\n[list]\n    [*]This game is not a normal metroidvania game that those looking for would like. The game is linear and with some backtracking mostly for optional stuff. The game is heavy on story and you will read A LOT, but you can skip it if you want.\n\n    [*]I’ll start with the gameplay. The simple combat you have is using a normal laser, bomb/missle gun, a heavy laser/swap gun and your wrench to kill or stun enemies. You get these at certain points in the game and as well as upgrades to your wrench to electrify it. This is used mostly in traversal and puzzles, not combat though.\n\n    [*]The game is overall very easy for those looking for a challenge unless you start the new game with one hit mode. The enemies and bosses you encounter are all unique in they look and attack patterns that each requires a different approach to killing them.  With some having to be avoided, stunned or more creative ways to get past them with tools acquired later.\n\n    [*]The bosses are the best part of the game. You have so much creativity in the design of each one that I wish there was a boss rush mode to replay them, minus a few. The developer didn’t make them insanely hard which most people, even me expect when hearing about bosses in games. They aren’t that hard, just require a certain way to defeat with even the annoying or unexplained bosses were still creative like a stealth boss, tag teaming with your companions, and using your wrench that fits and sets the game apart with the design of these bosses\n\n    [*]The game has chests you open for the “light Metroidvania” aspect that you get materials to craft passive abilities that you also find through various ways. This feels like an afterthought as it’s the only thing that makes this game from being just a straight linear game. Nothing wrong with that, but since it’s optional and not fully useful unless trying to 100% and find optional bosses. The abilities are useful, you can have 3 active. Each hit takes the abilities away until you get orbs to heal the slot from doing basic stuff, which in the world isn’t that bad, but during boss fights are worthless. So for me they felt like an afterthought or didn’t want them to be required to progress, which also makes since.\n\n    [*]The story is interesting and I didn’t skip it, it’s a mixed bag on tone though as the game is very heavy on religious and philosophical ideas, which I find interesting. It will get serious and then undercut with an out of place joke or 4th wall breaking reference. The game can also just use a character to preach at times. It felt like totally going against what the character vibe is. This makes the characters not as consistent and makes the characters that are very one simple even more shallow. The 2 most interesting characters were enemy agents that one would preach but that was his character and it fit with who he was and the other was a female that had mixed emotions over what she was doing and hated life. The four main characters didn’t have the same level of depth and at times would get annoying.\n\n    [*]The game does have one entire level and other areas that had elevators that would require so much backtracking to use these properly. Why they don’t have buttons to call elevators to the level your on is so stupid. That one entire level was annoying instead of interesting because of this. They can also not explain how to defeat certain bosses or what to even do.\n\n    [*]Overall the game was a blast to play and seeing this world and its characters, the interesting religious story and showing the many facets of it along with interesting villains. The fact that one guy made all these interesting bosses to fight blows my mind. But even the few mistakes or inconsistency I can’t wait to see what he creates next.\n\n [/list]\n\n[h1]My Score: [/h1]\n[b]B[/b]\n\n[b]Paid: $17[/b]\n[b]Completed in: 17 hours to 100%, even less if not backtracking[/b]\n\nGames similar I recommend: \n[list]\n    [*]Shovel Knight\n    [*]Ori and the Blind Forest\n    [*]The Talos Principle \n    [*]Axiom Verge\n    [*]Looking to try next: Owlboy\n\n [/list]",
      "[h1]The Good[/h1]\n- Cop System.\n- Best progression in a need for speed game in years.\n- Genuinely fun and engaging, builds on the foundation of nfs2015 while taking the good mechanics from payback to make a compelling game. If the need for speed hype was still around people would stop asking for most wanted again because want it or not this is it, even if it falls short on a few cases.\n- Feel of \"speed\".\n- Insanely beautiful, runs super well, amazing lighting. Looks good on both day and night.\n- Day and night have different purposes in the game, and the fact you can choose is pretty cool as well. You can sweat if you want or if you want just races you can stay in the day.\n- Visual customization with community decals, let's go!\n- Online entirely optional, is kind of the same as nfs2015 instead of payback having the singleplayer map but instead allowing free roam drivers which is pretty cool\n- Car profiles like we have in forza, no more taking a racing car into the offroad! They actually perform as they should!\n- Good map\n- Crossplay\n- Character customization\n\n[h1]The Bad[/h1]\n- Cop System. It has a lot of rough edges that will piss you off. Yes it's the difficulty players wanted but also too much rubberbanding, \"rhino incoming\" taking half your screen not actually letting you see the rhino, game basically requiring you to abuse ramps because there's no proper way to actually deal with cops, etc.\n- Story is short and shitty. Payback as mid as it was did the \"corrupt cop\" storyline better\n- Progression system is taken back by the included powerful starter cars which came from the deluxe edition. It's fine since it's included but I hate how good features are destroyed with certain executive decisions\n- No post-release support, as it's the case with EA games\n- Need origin to play\n- Lots of bugs\n\n[h1]Neutral[/h1]\n- Overall teenager aesthetic. I like the neon style, but the overall teenager stuff and spanish characters (which are here because of the la casa de papel trend) just don't click with me. I just cringe all over the marketing material and how the characters engage\n- 21:9 support is fine not considering the map which doesn't scale to 21:9 unfortunately\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nThis is it boys. Need for speed is back!",
      "This game can be great at times but extremely frustrating most of the time. 80% change to hit, miss every time. I can't keep playing a game with so much crappy coding.",
      "This game was a real treat. I played the 1st Valfaris and became an instant fan. I love that this is direction went by the developers, I feel it was a really good evolution of the series and mixing it up with a shoot em up gives it that extra punch/kick/slash. The graphics, characters and bosses are just so awesome and you can feel the grittiness of the mechs. Aside from the awesome game play, the environments and atmosphere has really leveled up. Love the boss destruction sequence as you can feel that accomplishment of kicking its ass. looking forward to Valfaris next installment. Congratulations with this metal AF game!",
      "-This game is like the combination of old PC sidescroller like Duke Nukem (pre-3d), NES Contra, and arcade Metal Slug with 80s /90s cyberpunk and action movie tropes.\n-The cheesy humor, plot, and music is top notch. Might look like a shallow nostalgia at a glance but once you played it, they even spiritually nailed the silliness of similar games/story in that era. The guns, the character acting and lines, the costume design, etc.\n-It's not as fast paced as I thought it would be. But actually that makes it relaxing to play. Easy to get into and the challenge is just right for me without being frustrating. \n-I like how the enemies and characters are pretty diverse. \n-I haven't finished the game but I feel like this game will have similar replay value like Streets of Rage 4. Not because of there are many things to do or getting better at the game but because it's somehow just simply tight, fun, and arcadey to replay.",
      "[b][i]AMID EVIL[/i] is very much [i]Quake[/i] 1 level design in a [i]Hexen[/i]/[i]Heretic[/i] universe.[/b] It's well done. We're a bit spoiled this year with outstanding '90s FPS shooters. Personally, I prefer both [i]Ion Maiden[/i] and [i]DUSK[/i] over this title for the following reasons:\n\n1) I find [i]AMID EVIL[/i] to be a bit generic in terms of theme; the fantasy setting could use a bit more to set it apart.\n\n2) I prefer real or low fantasy weapons/guns over wands and totally high fantasy weapons. Now, don't get it twisted - I appreciate that these high fantasy weapons exist, but yeah, they leave something to be desired. I miss reloading and all of that. \n\n3) The level design in [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is much more 'sprawling' (for lack of a better term) just like the original [i]Quake[/i]. Most levels are indoors in what feels like an underground compound (at the time of writing this review). I personally like the backwoods feel of [i]DUSK[/i], or the dystopian cityscape of [i]Ion Maiden[/i] far more. I want to look up at the sky in most levels.\n\n4) The enemy design is different than the other two games I mention, which is good - but they all mostly have a 'same' kind of feel. The enemies are all super fast, so most of your efforts are focused on running backwards while fending them off. It's fun, but gunplay isn't quite as fun as the other two games for this particular reason.\n\n5) The font and overall menu system definitely feels 'Early Access'. I know the font is being worked on, which is desperately needed. \n\n6) My favorite way to play the game is Endless mode - and I feel like that's a flaw in itself. It's the opposite for me with [i]DUSK[/i]. I want to fall in love with the campaign, but eh, there isn't really any story or anything all that interesting to suck me in. The secrets are super easy to find compared to the other two games, too.\n\n7) No multiplayer. Now, I really don't care about this - but who designs a game in this genre without building this in from the ground up? You know the community is going to whine about this. Questionable design decision to say the least.\n\n[b]Well, it sounds like I just dumped all over the game.[/b] Please don't get me wrong. [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is a welcome addition to the genre. The *great news* is that this is not just some reskin of [i]DUSK[/i] - it certainly is it's own thing. And that's really important. \n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+Fairly polished game for Early Access\n+It's the most modern version of the original [i]Quake[/i] we've seen this year\n+Well optimized\n+Lots of content right now\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-The universe is generic\n-No multiplayer\n-The font is too hard to read\n-Music is nothing to write home about\n-The secrets are easy, and there really aren't all that many of them\n-Weapons could use more 'oomph' to them; also we should be able to use the special ability when we want to as opposed to it autotriggering\n\n[b]I was psyched out of my mind for [i]AMID EVIL[/i] - and while it is certainly good - I think I'll be focused more on [i]DUSK[/i] and [i]Ion Maiden[/i].[/b] Because, let's face it, gaming time is valuable and we can't play everything.",
      "I vividly remember the moment when I gave up on Fallout 3: I was the ruins of some city, with a grey sky looming over the shredded grey concrete shells of buildings, and vast chunks of broken grey highway was wrapped up against, around, over and under huge chunks of grey concrete. My companion had gotten stuck somewhere in the grey sea of rubble for the umpteenth time, and it just suddenly struck me: This game isn't fun. It's just depressing.\n\nA few years later, I recalled this experience to a friend of mine, and he assured me: \"Fallout 4 isn't grey. It's got colors. And it's good.\" Having banked 1410 hours in game, I would have to say he was right.\n\nIs Fallout 4 good RPG? Nope. The story is rubbish, the characters extremely shallow, and the skill tree is very meh. If you hate VATS, like I do, the skill tree is complete rubbish. Is it good because it is bug free and has good DLC's? Nope. Is it good because it's the best shooter ever? Nope. Fallout 4 is good game because it's fun, and it's fun because it's a decent shooter, with an OK open world, good atmosphere and a sense a humor. Slap some of the 1000's of existing mods on that, and there's a decent chance that the next time you emerge from the elevator of Vault 111, switching to the catchy tunes of Diamond City Radio as you ready your gun and take in the not-grey landscape, you'll be smiling, just like I do.\n\nUpdate: Due to the recent Skyrim \"update\", breaking mods and introducing paid mods, and a similar downgrade being reported as coming for Fallout 4, I can no longer recommend this game, or any other Bethesda product.",
      "One of my favorite Final Fantasy games, the story, characters, and setting are just too perfect. The music is amazing and I love the ARPG style combat. I think they did an amazing job of deviating from the standard JRPG with this game.\n\nWhy on earth do I not recommend it then?\n\nBecause the Steam version is BROKEN. The last update Square Enix did gave the game a horrible stutter and memory leak so that the game's extremely painful to play. There's no mod that fixes it like Nier: Automata either. The only way to fix it is to roll back your game version, which means no Ardyn DLC, no Comrades DLC, a bunch of other DLC items get removed, and you're stuck playing an inferior version of the game.\n\nMost developers would fix that ASAP. But Square Enix doesn't understand the PC platform or value their PC gamer customers enough to be bothered with fixing their broken games. I say this as one of the biggest fans of the Final Fantasy franchise there is. I love Final Fantasy from the bottom of my heart. But Square Enix's business practices are unacceptable.\n\nImagine if a car company put out a car and it turned out the brakes didn't work and the car company just said \"Well, we moved our factory staff onto the next product, so you'll just have to drive around without brakes.\"\n\nThat's basically what Square Enix is doing with this game.\n\nFIX YOUR MISTAKE, SQUARE ENIX.\n\nFrom a loyal fan and customer who's bought nearly every Final Fantasy game on multiple platforms.",
      "\"it's a puzzle game dressed up as a wargame\"\n\n1. puzzle games don't have this much randomness\n\n2. it uses authentic hex wargame conventions/mechanics so it's more of a puzzle game built out of a wargame\n\n3. you can take the puzzle element out of it by customizing your game.yml file to allow +5 turns, then play each scenario slow",
      "Would be nice to get a definitive upgrade rather than paying full price for dragon quest xi definitive version",
      "Great game! At times it can get frustrating (boss battles), but the good out weighs the bad by a landslide. Even when i did get mad, which was a lot, I never stayed mad for long. There is just far too much to enjoy about the game. The art style is just simply amazing, the movement of your character around the world is just so satisfying once you get used to it, the puzzles aren't too easy or too hard, and everything in the game just goes together pretty much perfectly. All in all this game is extremely well made. Would recommend buying if you want a super unique experience 11/10",
      "This game deserves a more in depth review than it has had yet, so I'll do my best.\n\nBetween the campaign and the puzzles there is some good content that will make you think hard.\nThe Campaign's final battle was suitably epic.  Unfortunately, beating the campaign and trying all of the puzzles and only failing on 2 out of 17 puzzles, both of which I think were bugged, only took me 13.8 hours.  paying the 6 USD sale price for 13.8 hours of good fun, I think I got my money's worth, but I've had better deals. \n\n what would give this endless hours of fun would be if the multiplayer or offline vs. CPU modes were good.  Unfortunately I've tried searching for multiplayer games without being able to find any.  It seems like this game got buried in mass of games being produced nowadays and noone bought it, so unless you have a steam friend you can buy this game for and convince to play it with you or this game shocks everyone with a second wind of sales then multiplayer just isnt going to happen.  Multiplayer also lacks a menu where you could potentialy see what other players games are going on and have an option to observe those games if those players allowed observers into their games.\n\nthe Offline VS. CPU mode didn't impress me either.  This and multiplayer are the only modes where you can build your deck from the full complement of cards in the game.  The Campaign, while fun, doesnt even use a deck in 6 of the 9 missions, and when it does use a deck, your card choices are heavily limited.  Unfortunately, the CPU AI is pretty bad, so I can't realy test what cards are good or bad effectively in the VS. CPU mode.  Another feature I would have liked to see for the VS CPU mode would have been the ability to play with or give the CPU a random deck.  there is no random deck option, you have to pick your opponents deck, so you know what they have.\n\nOne thing that disappointed me from Steam's side is that in the window for \"similar to games I play\" on this game's store page, it didn't list Pox Nora.  This game is infact similar to Pox Nora and less buggy than that game.  Last I played Pox Nora was like 2 years ago though but I have over 390 hours in that game.\n\nOverall I'll give this game a 6.8/10  I wanted to give it a higher score, and I still do reccomend it.  It is good fun and takes a good amount of thinking hard for about 13.8 hours.  Understand that if you do buy it, chances are you probably wont find yourself playing it much longer than that.\n",
      "Okay this is a weird situation. I personally don't like this game all that much, but I do still recommend it nonetheless. That's because despite me not being personally huge on it, I can't deny that it is a very well-crafted game that definitely will give people the experience they want if this is the type of game they're looking for. I, turns out, am not part of the crowd that is targeted for said experience. I just found the whole trial and error stealth RTS style of this game to just not be my cup of tea, but again I can't deny its very well-crafted. I also think the art style and voice acting and story are all very well done as well. So yeah, if you're fond of games of this type, then go for it. I'm sure you won't be disappointed. I, for one, don't think I'm entirely sold on it though.",
      "Disclaimer: This is review from player who prefer story-rich game and haven't played any game by Arkhouse Telegraph.\n\nThe good:\n+ Outstanding 80's-esque visual pixel artstyle. It reminds me of few SNES/Atari/Gameboy games.\n+ Fairly good soundtrack.\n+ Some cutscene/area have fascinating atmosphere.\n+ Run well with Steam proton, so it's likely this game is playable for Linux/Steam Deck user. Although the platformer area might show too many small detail for 7\" display.\n+ Game OST/artbook is available for free on Arkhouse website.\n\nThe bad:\n- While i understand nature of this game require player to find out most thing and go through trial-and-error, some parts definitely need to be explained better. I refer to lack of autosave (for most part of the game), not letting player know about manual save (you can do it by head left after exit for cylinder elevator until you see display/sign \"< S\" and suggestion to visit block H (where you get some guidance).\n- While the manual say i can play R. U. N. E. 3000 first, i have hard time understanding the story and lore/world building. Conversation such as \"DO? DORODO!\" is mostly gibberish and i only can make vague guess based on few specific term (\"V2\", \"50/50\", etc.) and area i've visited. Short recap of previous games (even it's on the manual) could be really helpful for newcomers.\n\nThe ugly:\n* I experience a bug where i fight boss i'm not supposed to fight yet. In detail, [spoiler] after i exit from P block to get symbol cracking code, i was thrown to G block where i fight G-Cat/10th boss. The worst part is the boss HP bar started with red color and auto 3-60 cannon never perform attack. Fortunately the bug doesn't occur again after i load from manual save.  [/spoiler].\n* The gameplay variation/idea is very interesting, but the execution is mixed bags (more explanation on below paragraph)\n\nSaturn Quest: R. U. N. E. 3000 has lots of gameplay variant/modes (Adventure, Shoot'em up, Platformer and many more) to keep the game fresh. While each area/boss have different reason why it's challenging/difficult, many of those is very unbalanced. For example, [spoiler] Bioplatus M-3D/6th boss [/spoiler] require you to have extraordinary eye-hand coordination and multitasking skill. Among all enemy that resemble boss fight, i only managed to beat 6-7 boss without using cheat.\n\nThis game also has very few checkpoint on each area/boss. On adventure/platformer area, you could restart from beginning after spending 10-20 minutes where you have to avoid same trap or collect same item again. On boss fight, that means you'll need to repeat whole fight most of the time. It's could be annoying because since you're forced to find out boss behavior the hard way or repeating tedious part of the fight.\n\n3 HP and lack of difficulty option could be irritating for most modern player. There are time when i found out i only lose 3-10 HP when i use cheat and beat the boss. If there's easier difficulty where i have 6-10 HP, i could beat more boss by myself. But don't get me wrong, i feel really satisfied each time i beat boss (which i deemed can be beaten with practical amount of effort) without cheat. If the developer bother add easy difficulty which has higher player HP, give more Nana and slightly lower boss HP, far more people could enjoy this unique piece of artwork.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nWhile i have some rant, it's really unique experience even though i've played few hundred games. In overall, i have more positive sentiment than negative sentiment of this game. But even though i choose \"Yes\" when Steam ask \"Do you recommend this game?\", i'd rather choose \"Neutral\" or \"Information\" instead. If you're fan of 80's game or really like difficult game, you might come to like this game. But for most people, i'd recommend you to seek other game. Although if you really insist to play this game, you could use Cheat Engine and modify HP/Nana using value type Double (also called float64 or 8-byte float).\n\nP.S. I definitely will play the sequel (Episode IV-VI: White Meteor Saga according to the artbook) [b]IF[/b] the developer bother add easy difficulty option and more checkpoint during boss fight/exploration.",
      "Their last privacy agreement update (January 1st, 2021) states they will \"sell\" users information, including name, email and billing address to third party companies (including social media and advertising).

Sure the game has nice graphics but the game play, toxic online players, and poor physics make this one of the most frustrating games I have ever played.

      "The latest S tier Deckbuilder Roguelike, joining the ranks of Slay the Spire and Monster Train for me. I think that's all that really needs to be said.\n\nIt leans heavily into kiss/curse type effects, if you like the ability to manipulate rng and do some busted stuff with your sequencing you will love it. It is more of a thinker on a turn to turn basis than other games of this genre, but if that isn't a turn off then it's a really solid game with some unique characters/mechanics that feel fresh.",
      "I like the game, but I'd recommend waiting for the full release.\nDon't get me wrong, the game is beautiful and it's got great potential. The problem with it is, mostly, the keybindings. They are incredibly uncomfortable to use and you cannot change them.\nPlus, the dialogues sometimes feel never ending and quite pointless.",
      "Edited\n\nI Didn’t have high expectations for this game. I read the reviews and expected a mediocre game from ubisoft. I was let down big time. I was given a watered down version of Syndicate that had terrible game mechanics.\n\tAs I navigated the first enemy compound I came across it felt difficult to navigate through the grass and between the buildings. Clearly not developed as a stealth game. Once I had given up on the whole stealth aspect of the mission I was very easily able to slaughter all of the guards in the compound. I trying using the bow but it’s hard to use compared to Tomb Raider and Far Cry Primal’s easy to use bow. Sword combat could have been improved but it wasn’t the worst I’ve seen. No skill required, just click the mouse button rapidly to kill all of the guards in your path. The devs clearly didn’t try that hard because they knew that people would by their game anyways because of Ubisoft and Assassin’s Creed fanboys.\n\tAssassin’s Creed: Origins could’ve been an amazing game that would revolutionize the series but no. The devs had to ruin that possibility by being lazy and making a watered down version of Syndicate. I’ve played Syndicate quite a bit and I thought it was a good game. Don’t get this game for the full price or even for $35. Let’s hope Ubisoft gets their shit together and doesn't fuck up Far Cry 5.\n\nThank you for your time.",
      "WHERE ARE MY OG DS FANS OF THIS GAME? REJOICE BRUDDAS!\n\nNo but seriously, I loved this game to DEATH when it first came out on the DS and to now see an HD version of this game on steam. It's quite a whiplash but a good one! To anyone who loves mystery/ detective games, YOU NEED TO GET THIS!!! Good story, soundtrack and gameplay <3 AHHHHHH!!!",
      "DO NOT BELIEVE WHAT EVERYONE ELSE IS SAYING. This game is a bloody masterpiece, it just takes the proper skill and knowledge to properly play it. There are proper real life mechanics which are fun as well as true to the real life process of making games. I personally have less than half an hour of experience with this game, showing that this is a captivating game that really draws you in and makes you beg for more. This is one of the games which will definitely be up there for GOTY. winkyface",
      "This version comes bundled together with some kind of horrid bloatware called \"Steam\" which functions as a type of DRM meaning you do not actually own the game. Avoid at all costs, buy it on CD instead!",
      "Imagine releasing an \"update\" that breaks peoples games/ mods, JUST SO YOU CAN PUT A BANNER AD IN THE MENU FOR BL3. Just WOW.",
      "UPDATE: This remains to be one of the best games I have ever played. The company that created the game though... One more launcher that is completely unnecessary. The performance with the 'next-gen' update is horrible. I have half the fps I used to have on the very same rig and that is after going lower with the settings that I used to have. Why did you have to do this b U Ll $I t?\n\n\nThe best way to embrace the true greatness of this game is to look on how the series has improved since the first and the second part of The Witcher. You simply won't find anything that hasn't changed for the better.\n\n- Vast open world that IS NOT randomly created and filled with dull stuff,\n- Story which engages you from the first 10 minutes to the very end,\n- Graphics, even despite the whole controversy of a thing called downgrade, still makes this game THE BEST LOOKING RPG ever created,\n- Soundtrack, it finally goes back to the style presented originally in The Witcher 1, something that makes you forget that's just the video game, it gives you the feeling you are in there, in some village, city or that you are fighting with someone / something, which turns every single battle into an unforgettable memory,\n- Every single side quest, and believe me, there is A LOT of them, is actually a little story that keeps you playing with the same force as the main quests - I call it - a new quality in RPGs,\n- Choices and their impact on the story - even a small choice that seems insignificant at the time can wage on the whole world around you,\n- THIS GAME IS MATURE, finally a game dealing with a lot of subjects which are usually handled very childishly or not at all,\n- Combat - nothing more to add, it's decent, though it's nothing to be praised really, you won't be able to mash buttons and win - you have to dodge, use signs, and on higher difficulties get yourself ready to have an oil for a specific enemy and a bomb to be able to put an end to his or her misery.\n\nThe Witcher 3 is not a game without its flaws, although nothing that can't be fixed - some balance issues, economy basically showing Geralt as a very wealthy person (who he should not be), small performance problems like stuttering in Novigrad and in my opinion very limited after the end content (fixed by the expansions). Many of the things I struggled with have been already fixed and there is no need to disclose them. \n\nAll in all, one of the best games in the last few years (even a decade).",

      "[h1] Brief summary of why the Chinese players are so pissed: [/h1]\n\nThe reason for the chinese players to absolutely despise the third party modding website is that the \"official modding\" was promised to be released over a year ago, but kept getting delayed. When it finally got released, everyone felt betrayed because it was a garbage third party website with so many restrictions.\n\nBut the reason why the game is still getting review bombed is the [b] developer's initial response [/b] to the first round of complaints. The team was dead silent for about 2 weeks, no comments about all the fiasco, yet people that were complaining about the modding on the chinese forums got their accounts banned left and right. Thats why many resorted to steam review bombing, and almost as soon as the steam review tanked, the developer came out and said the steam workshop will be launching in the end of the month, something he had being saying was \"really hard for the team\" and kept \"facing difficulties\" for the past year.\n\nSo yeah.... I kinda understand why people are still really mad about this one",
      "Before you play this, make sure you play these games in order. That is:\n- To the moon\n- Finding Paradise\n- Imposter factory.\n\nAs for this game, it is another gorgeous story that takes you on a journey into the realm of memories. I encourage you to play these games blindly and to read nothing about the story because that's what I did, and I was surely surprised and mindblown. As for the ending of this game, I am still processing it to this day!\n\nI can't wait to play the next game by Freebird Games.",
      "Fall Guys had a rough start. Unstable servers and people cheating to win. About a year later I picked it up again and I must say it really has improved a lot. I honestly don't have any issues which cheaters anymore and the servers don't crash on me anymore.\n\nIt's also getting more and more stages to play so it feels refreshing to play a few rounds every day.  The events for certain skins are also really fun. Sure there could still be some improvements like personal usernames or maybe a way to trade in skins you don't want. But I feel like they listen to their community and are aiming to make it as fun as possible. I'm interested to see how Fall Guys will keep evolving!",
      "As a Spider-Man fan, this game is a real treat. It was fantastic 4 years ago on release for the PS4, and it's even more fantastic now that it's finally on PC. If you're a Spidey fan, especially one who deeply appreciates the mythos and the message is represents, then this game is 100% for you. The writing, visuals, audio and gameplay are all wonderful, through and through. It's a true labour of love, Insomniac did an incredible job. Bring on the Miles Morales port!",
      "It's one of my favorite games of all time, yet I cannot recommend it. And it pains me.\n\nLike many others, I think that the latest update, alpha 17, was a huge step in the wrong direction. Instead of being a zombie-survival game with awesome building mechanics where you could build huge and massive bases, it simply became a zombie-killing grindfest, where bases don’t matter, because zombies chew through concrete like it was nothing.\n\nAlso, don't get me started on the zombie AI. It was fine in alpha 16 and the zombies acted as you would expect; dumb. In alpha 17, the pathing of the AI is just ridiculous, where the zombies are able to estimate the path of least resistance, as if they were not only sapient, but extremely intelligent. This has led to the current base building-meta; mazes and ramps. /facepalm\n\nThe skill system was utterly destroyed as well. In Alpha 16, you could improve cardio by running, you could improve mining-efficiency by, well mining - so on so forth. Now, you just kill zombies to gain exp, get perk points and then spend said perk points. To be fair, they have buffed exp gains from other activities recently, but you still simply gain and spend perk points - yet another horrible downgrade.\n\nAlso, let’s talk about loot. In Alpha 16 you could loot items ranging from quality 1 to 600. Weapons and certain tools had components of individual quality that you could then combine to form said weapon/tool, that would have the average quality level of said parts. The quality would determine the damage/durability of the weapon etc. This system was great and gave an incitement to go out in the world and continue to loot, even if you had, say the AK47, because you could improve it vastly by finding better parts. This has been replaced by a system where all weapons/tools are looted whole in a quality system ranging from 1 to 6. Yes, 1 to 6. Minimal difference in damage/durability, but hey, at least you can attach mods to the weapons now. The amount of mods you can attach are determined by the level of the item. You can now improve the damage of your rifle by painting it in another color. Great…\n\nThe performance of the game… hehehehe. All the new textures and lighting of A17 has brought so many performance issues, and yet again, it used to be just fine in Alpha 16. Don’t bother mentioning it to the devs, they’ll just give you a douchy response about your rig being a potato, even though you’re running with high-end parts. \n\nIn conclusion, no I would not recommend the game. However, you can opt in for playing Alpha 16, which I would recommend – if you can accept that the game might never evolve any further.",
      "The core game is fun, and scratches an itch for miniatures combat that I often have.\n\nTwo reasons I don't recommend: \n(i) the single player AI is quite easy once you figure it out.  You can face challenging scenarios but it's because at higher difficulty levels the AI adds sheer weight of numbers. It doesn't get appreciably smarter, so the only challenge you face is how to funnel larger, dumb formations of enemies to come at you.  The campaign mode is just a series of battles against randomly generated forces with extremely thin randomly-generated narrative interludes of about a paragraph in length, with no strategic map, or concepts of supply or resources. It does not meaningfully extend the length of time single player is fun.\n\n(ii) Multiplayer relies on too many things that are opaque to people who have just played single player.  There are a lot of rules and features (like how you get sub-commanders - it comes down to arcane placement of cavalry troops in setup), that are not documented in the rules or in any tutorial.  Unless you are willing to read the forums for both this game and the original game and try to glean this information, you will be perpetually at a disadvantage against the majority of the community who have been playing since the first game.  \n\nIf you like miniatures tabletop gaming and have lots of spare time to devote to the game to learning it in spite of the game not fully explaining its mechanics or giving feedback to you on enemy actions, it will be worthwhile.  Otherwise, the single player experience by itself doesn't warrant buying at full price. Worth it at 50% off.",
      "Great gameplay with baaad user experience. There are no tooltips or explanations as to what is going on at all, just kinda gotta figure it out. Otherwise the gameplay is smooth and there's a climb mode called spiral, slay the spire style, very fun. 5 different classes all able to level their decks and get new cards and abilities until lvl 30 I think, got my enchantress to 20 but still more to go. Story mode is more of a tutorial but still interesting.",
      "PC version doesn't have rebindable controls for controller for some reason\n\nupdate: i have finished the game, still no rebindable controls, i can give a real review now. i wouldn't rate it negative but i wouldn't rate it positive either. this is a \"eh\" review.\n\nthe game is two games at once and neither of them are great.\n\n the roguelike part is like 20% of the game and is very simple and shallow, there's like 5 weapons and they all play the same, its also super easy. its ok but its not as good as a real roguelike.\n\n the cult building part is 80% of the game and is a bit more fun but past the earlygame its a bit eh too. choosing what you get doesn't really matter since you'll unlock everything pretty fast, and the doctrines 90% of the time are a choice between 2 useless things and 10% of the time a choice between a busted thing and a useless thing. the randomly generated quests the followers give you are just chores like revisiting old dungeons you already completed and the reward is pretty much nothing. its ok but its not as good as a real colony builder.\n\nnone of the systems in either part of the game are particularly deep.\n\nas of the time of this review, the game is still quite glitchy, though being patched by the devs.\n\nthe game is about 15 hours with side content and 18 hours for a completionist run. no real replayability \n\ni'd just recommend you get a full on action roguelike if you want to play a roguelike, or a full on colony builder if you want to play a colony builder. this game does both but is not great at either of them. \n\n game is very cute tho and the soundtrack is great. like 5/10",
      "Do you kinda like 4X games, but mostly the first 2-3 hours of the game where you're exploring and hacking a basic civilization out of the wilderness and desperately fending off natural threats while trying to keep people fed and productive? If so, this game is for you. Nice tight gameplay loop where things never get stagnant for too long; always novel threats and opportunities, and you're not tied to any one settlement for very long, so victory and defeat alike are more temporary. Not to mention a really astounding amount of fun, polished content for an early access game! Eremite, Hooded Horse, I salute you.",
      "This was released alongside about 10 other big Steam releases around the end of October 2022 and so it is very tempting to joke about how it's better than all of those combined, the real GOTY so on and so forth, as I'm sure has been done already. But what I noticed was that out of all those releases, this one had an emphasis on comedy, which is very difficult to execute successfully in any form of media. There is no voice acting or any high-budget production so how the dialogue and seemingly basic visuals/animations kept me entertained throughout, just like the previous 2 games (from memory) is a tremendous achievement. At a point where I have played a bazillion high-budget action games, and will honestly play a bazillion more, games like this only become more important in showcasing how creative independence is imperative in creating uplifting experiences.\nAfter the prologue, seeing Frog Detective step out of the train and the camera pausing on his full-body shot was akin to, say, if I saw Shepherd step out of the Normany in ME4, or if I saw Keanu step out of a train in John Wick 4, it was really on that level for me.\nThough, I feel like the dance scenes at the end of this game was a step-down from Frog Detective 2 unfortunately, but still good.\n\nEdit: I nominated this game for 'Outstanding Visual Style' Steam Award!",
      "[h1] Look at my hours real quick. That's about. 4 hours? [/h1]\n\nFallout 76 is boring. There's no other way to put it. The Core objective of Fallout 76 was to gear the Fallout 4 engine for multiplayer. They succeeded! The art is visually amazing, even down to the 2D art shown all over this store page, so what's wrong?\n\nConsider who's still playing this game. Who's desperate enough to play this game? Well, It's not a lot of people. And they aren't very good people. It's just people. Existing. I had 0 conversations during my 4 hours. \n\nLets talk playing. The game is boring. Since I just mentioned the objective, lets talk about the NPC's ETC. [b] I got this game for free, I cannot emphasize how little this game means to me. It's terrible. [/b] The NPC's & story were not part of core development therefore the game suffers. You get stuck doing some quests you don't care about and play a game you'd rather not play. The NPC's are essential as expected so, you cannot kill them either. \n\nMicrotransactions Via Atomic Shop & Premium plague the game [i] but lets talk about more! [/i] There's free events like a crate dropping & player trading outposts. Wanna know what's wrong here? The game boils down to, find a player trading outpost and buy sh*t, or just dropping crates? well the crates are full of nothing. the games gear-towards premium really gives you nothing in terms of loot so you're playing what is a hollow, unfinished, boring, game. Even in 2021! \n\nCreatures & enemies are cool however there's a big issue of the game not being cool. You may say its worth it to play just to engage the wild-life but even they feel soul-less and void of life. I don't know how you make a game so devoid of soul really. I've met mannequins with more personality than anything I met in Fallout 76. \n\nThe world isn't interesting, it's a barren void forestry area. Sometimes you get a tiny bit of quest, however aside from this game being a complete and utter lore-destroyer for those interested, what it does leave is not good enough to compensate for all of the cons. Honestly, if this was a mod for 4, I'd feel better. But even when getting this for free, I feel scammed.\n\n[b] I'll end this by repeating my hours. 4. At no point was I excited. Enthralled. Interested. I sat for 4 hours, wanting to tear my hair out and scream, because I was so bored. I had tests in school, more interesting than this. The entire 4 hours I spent playing, I wish I had played anything else, & I got this for free! I genuinely wish you the best of help if you end up buying this game. It's horrific. [/b]",
      "Oh, that The Resident Evil (The RE)… One of the best stories in the gaming industry! The Capcom is well done that decided to remake games. Many players criticize The RE3, but I understand them, the game is quite short, there are no horror elements in the game. But the game has become easier, for example, a knife does not wear out. The players did not forget to criticize the Nemesis too, saying that there is no element of surprise and persecution, and there’s no sense of the constant presence of someone, who can mutilate you. The Nemesis means in English as “a good script”. However, the game creators tried to convey the atmosphere of The RE and the horror that the doomed city is filled with. Well-chosen actors, excellent voice acting, correctly conveyed the atmosphere of the city. I would add more moving elements on the destroyed streets of the city, like people or zombies\nTotal score: 8.5/10",
      "What starts as a simple game of jumping over some spikes quickly becomes something so much more. Geometry dash is like Minecraft. No matter how many times you quit, you always come back to it (as you can see by my 700 hours of playtime). For $3.99 you get such an amazing and memorable experience.

      "I really liked the concept of this game of navigating through orbits to collect crates and then successfully landing on the exit.  However, there just isn't enough content to justify it being sold as a complete product, especially at its current price of $6.99.  You see everything there is in the first couple of levels.  No new mechanics are added to the game as you progress.  The developer admits that the game is too simple and the fix was to add artificial difficulty to make the game longer.  For instance, rather than have intuitive controls using toggles, it requires the player to activate thrusters with one hand and turn them off with another.  The level design stops adding anything new and just adds more tedious narrow paths that must be navigated rather than an actual challenge or puzzles.  Finally, the DLC appears to be “pay to win” rather than getting any new content, it just gives the player access to aircraft that should be included already in the game.  By level 9 it is near impossible to progress any further with the default ship as it cannot accelerate fast enough to get through the small orbit and requires purchasing the DLC to advance the level.",
      "The best driving simulator, period.\nUnmatched soft-body physics, customization, sounds, graphics - everything in BeamNG is close to perfection - and the game is still in early access! The only feature it lacks is visual customization (liveries, stickers, bodykits etc), but these aren't available in many autosims (looking at you, Assetto Corsa). Lots of quality mods which include cars, maps, and a freaking JATO rocket ensure you'll have hundreds of hours of fun here. Touge, track, drift, rally, time attack, offroad, rock crawling, drag - and with zero level loading screens; just a few seconds to switch your car. Zero DLCs, intuitive interface, and built-in gamepad support are also here. 10/10 worth your time and money.\n\nUpdate v0.24: where negative reviews come from\nAfter the major UI overhaul a lot of negative reviews were posted. Many of those call the game \"literally unplayable\" - which is obviously greatly exaggerated, unlike the other stated problem: lost controller presets. That one is actually unpleasant to deal with (judging from the reviewers' words, since I myself didn't experience a single problem with my DualShock4 nor with the game itself), but yet it was not a force majeure that could not be avoided, as every major update comes after a teaser - which should be a sign for everyone with a custom preset to save or write it down, just in case the update affects it.\n\nTo sum up, BeamNG.drive is still a nearly perfect-rated game - and a lot of the negative reviews are, to put it mildly, unjustified.\n\nUpdate: I love the new Covet.",

Trust me there are a lot of people in the game that will back you up and want to help, so don't let one bad experience make you quit the game for good.\n\nThere are a LOT of maps to learn and a lot of small details in every one.

Look at the places they check as they sweep rooms. Watch the paths they take. Look at how they engage in gun fights and how they rotate around the map. \n-Spend the extra few dollars to buy a version with some operators - it'll make game play more fun for you and you'll have an easier time finding operators that work best with your play style. \n-Squad up with friends - being able to communicate and laugh in a discord can really improve the game experience, even if it's just one other person.\n-Best way to really understand an operator is to play them, so take advantage when there are siege events that allow you to play whoever you want.

Let's compare w Mario Maker, the most similar game to this one:\n\n[edit: Updated to compare to SMM2 instead of 1]\nWhat Mario Maker 2 Does Better\n- Mario\n- Different themes/gameplay physics across multiple mario games\n- Much larger playerbase\n\nWhat Levelhead Does Better\n- Oh my god the search functionality\n    - Search by creator, difficulty, tags, what's popular, etc.\n    - TL;DR you can find the awesome, and avoid the crap\n- Level discovery\n    - Can actively advertise my levels\n    - Get rewarded for playing people's levels\n- $20\n- Dying doesn't take 12 years to respawn\n- Fun, short campaign to slowly unlock more creative tools after seeing how they are used\n- Local Co-op (or online with Parsec)\n- Leaderboards (if you care, I personally don't)\n\nI cannot stress enough how AMAZING it is to not have to suffer through crap levels. The search functionality is soooo good; as a casual player, it is the sole reason I stopped playing Mario Maker 1. Mario Maker 2 is better, but it still falls terribly short. I think the best part is that Levelhead gives people control over the visibility of their levels, as well as incentives to play other peoples, and that is something that SMM2 unfortunately lacks.",
      "Bad game. The story is bad, the graphics are meh, gameplay is bad and there isnt any nudity unlike the first one (to be clear the game doesnt say it has nudity so whatever) but at the end of the day its just a really bad game regardless. I understand that having the mirror name doesnt require nudity but everything is just slapped hastily slapped together to make a finished game. I had really high hopes from the devs of mirror but this was a big letdown as this game has nothing going for it unlike the quality nsfw elements that the first game had as its strong point.\n\nIf you are a weeb and you like the move the slot type games its ok but otherwise no need to play.",

      "This HD remake of the PS2/DC classic Rez breathes some new life into a very old gem, however the update only harms its own image due to simple design mistakes and the enhancements that only highlight those mistakes further.\n\nThe PS2 controller made targeting slow and the game was intentionally timed to the slow pace at which you could target enemies. This meant the sound fx and visuals tied to targeting and shooting were all in sync with the music - that's at the core of the Rez experience. However the massively improved VR controls make targeting and shooting VERY fast. As a result all the sound effects and visuals play at once in a cacophony, the enemies die, and then you have a long 4 - 8 beat stretch of nothing as the backing track plods along, waiting for new enemies to spawn.\n\nWhat makes this worse is that the graphic updates end up being largely absent. Enemies filled the middle ground of the scene, captured your attention, and were the source of many particles, effects, the music, and animation - but since they all die quickly you're often left staring at the sky box with nothing happening. Then looking around in VR during these wait periods you can see how empty and simple the levels are because the HD parts are in the effects not the environments.\n\nThis all becomes especially noticeable in Area 5 when you demolish a mini boss and you're left sitting for 2-3 minutes floating through a desolate low-poly void with half the song missing. It feels like the game is broken. They should either have put a limit on the speed at which you can lock-on to enemies (matching to the BPM of the track), added more enemies to match the faster pace of this version, or filled the spaces with stuff to interact with so you can trigger the SFX/VFX where the music and visual upgrades are hiding.\n\nNo new player is going to know that the game is -meant- to be synced to the music and even if they try it is entirely out of sync with itself. This aspect demolishes the intended audio/visual experience which is the point of the entire game. It's very sad to consider how stunning Child of Eden was when it took advantage of the expanded memory, gpu, and peripherals it had available, and it goes to show how much potential has been squandered here. This would have been obvious if it had been properly play tested.\n\nTo add salt to the wound, Area X (the new VR part of the game made for Infinite) failed to work on my Quest 2. I couldn't target anything so I just couldn't play that at all (I hear it's basically just 1 extra 15 min level anyway). Truly disappointing in every way.",
      "I didn't want to review this until I was completely done. I've now 100%'d the game. Quite simply, I think everyone should play this game! It's perfect for puzzle players with easy and difficult puzzles, most of which feel very satisfying to solve, has fantastic commentary about all of the perspectives of today's society (it's not just a one-sided view!) and is a genuinely well-crafted game.\n\nMost facets of the game are positive so I have to point out the negatives in the game.\n1: There is no save/load system, it's all automatic checkpoints and you have to go and back up the files manually if you want to see the results of different choices.\n2: The choices you can make, or miss, have some light dialog consequences but they occur over many hours of time. This is something I don't really expect from a puzzle game that used to always tell you \"you can return to any place you want at any time.\" In this game, you can't. The time of day and weather of locations can irrevocably change, the ending itself has some major changes, yet there's no way to see it all without replaying the game (a tough pill to swallow for a puzzle game) or watching the results on YouTube. I'm kinda against that sort of thing unless your game can be played multiple times and be different each time, which this won't be, because it's the same puzzles each time.\n3: The engine is Unreal 5 and it's very unfortunate. Although the game may have been easier to develop for multiple platforms in a faster time via doing this, but it has proven that Croteam's old Serious Engine was a much better engine. Unreal 5 has horrible eye adaptation, anti-aliasing, lighting, and geometry options that are all proven to be horrible via this game. Don't get me wrong, the game runs and looks fine for the most part, but all of it could look better and run better had it been built on any other engine. Yes, *any* other engine. I'd sooner have played this on the Source engine. Epic's Lumen and Nanite technology is still too unproven, early, and crappy to be the generational leap they claim to be. I hope the developer can better tune this stuff so players can have better framerates, less ghosting, better lighting, and eliminated distant object pop-in.\n4: The game's pace at the start and end are worse than they could be. The beginning spends too long (and a lot of later optional dialog depends on your exploration of this) in an open world without puzzles while the end has a final puzzle that includes a frustratingly tedious walk-about aspect that needed to be shortcutted somehow. Everything in between (including the breaks you get back in the open world bit) is perfectly crafted and paced, though.\n\nThese things said, I still insist that if you enjoy any form of puzzle game, like Antichamber or Portal, you play this game. You will enjoy it!",

      "I played the demo and instantly became enamored.

I jumped up to Hard to try to unlock a new ship, and I haven't been able to beat a run since then. It's probably just that I'm bad, all things considered, but be aware that the changes made with difficulty increases are probably more impactful than they may seem.\n\nAlso I wanna say to the devs: thank you for launching the game with mod support and working on making it easier!

      "This is a really clever game; smart and witty dialog, hand drawn graphic-novel style art, and creatively written missions.  I've only played through one set of 7 day missions but there is definitely a desire to go back and try to win in other ways.  In this game you have to manage the resource of your superheroes - not just which ones you think will survive the mission uninjured but to find compatibility and relationships between the superheroes.  There are some contrived bits, some superhero style (groan) humor - but overall this game lets you feel the joy, awkwardness, and humanity of relationships.  I *really* cared about these characters and their trials.  Love is love is love.

      "Ranking based on my \"clicking time\" is an odd designer's choice ... Is it a cheap way to add challenge? Apart from that, the game seems nice. Positive review for now, but it is kinda close call for me ...\n\nI admit, it is so fun to play, however, I have just completed 2 scenarios for the warrior and for the rogue and .. why is it so easy? Is the game goint to get any more difficult?\n\nI have just beaten summer campaign. Still absolutely no challenge.

It makes sense and it would be fun to define decks for more effecient play ... time based, however, adds frustration instead of satisfaction.

      "Digital Eclipse’s Making of Karateka is a fantastic interactive documentary giving a Criterion Collection quality exploration of a game as well as persevering it to allow people to play it. The collection focuses on Jordan Mechner’s early years in game dev up until the release of Karateka and its ports. The collection is structured in chapters chronologically with each chapter being comprised of timelines that showcase a smorgasbord of information dealing with Mechner’s early works and Karateka. This information includes content such as concept art, magazine articles, interactive viewers that allow you to see how the animation process of Karateka was designed, and present day interviews with people like Mechner, some of the old Broderbund crew who worked on Karateka, and game devs inspired by the game such as Tom Hall and John Tobias. The way this all is structured is really engaging. The interviews dealing with Mechner’s early years are especially charming as he and his dad reminisce how the whole family inspired and worked to help Jordan make Karateka like how his dad dressed up in a karate gi and essentially did the motion capture for the Karateka MC and how he composed the whole soundtrack. Making of Karateka also does a splendid job preserving not only Karateka and two of its most popular ports, but it also has playable prototype builds. It also has previously unreleased games Mechner made before Karateka complete with earlier design builds as well, one of them being Death Bounce, an Asteroids inspired space shooter. There’s just so much clear love and care put in this collection’s creation and it’s truly splendid to see, especially because video game history and preservation isn’t considered as a serious undertaking compared to older artistic mediums such as literature and film. Video games, being the youngest of the mediums, was born in the age of mass corporatization where being a product that sells is considered to be far more important than being of piece of artistic media that should be celebrated. Films managed to emerge right before rampant commercialization happened so they were still able to be considered art that needed to be preserved, but games haven’t been as lucky and tend to just be considered expendable products, especially by major publishers. It’s just so heartening to see something like this exist. I do have one problem when it comes to this whole package though, I think Karateka is just a straight up bad game. \n\nKarateka may have been a technical marvel at the time, as the documentary materials extensively shows, but it has completely aged like milk and is just not a good game to actually play anymore, especially in the present when a vast plethora of games have surpassed it in all regards. It’s slow, clunky, and repetitive, combat is just mainly spamming kick and moving and back forth, the hitbox on the eagle is an absolute pain in the ass, and running is super awkward and can lead to enemies’ one-shotting you if you don’t get into combat stance fast enough. There’s no lives or continues so you just gotta slog through all those boring fights and unskippable cutscenes all over again. I’m admittedly not a big fan of 80’s games, but I can pick up games like Super Mario Bros., Tetris, or Galaga and have fun with them and respect their quality, plus they’re still quite accessible. Karateka is just miserable, to the point I’m surprised people even liked it at the time. Like it’s kinda sad to me the most fun I had with Jordan Mechner’s older games in this collection was his blatant ripoff of Asteroids he made in high school. Similar to my thoughts on Night Dive’s remaster of Rise of the Triad this year, I feel Digital Eclipse gave a gold star treatment polishing to a turd, an influential one, but a turd nonetheless. Digital Eclipse also did their own remasters of Karateka and Death Bounce, they’re more playable but they still don’t really salvage the games at all to me. The Karateka remaster does add the option of giving yourselves extra lives and it does play a little better but it adds the leopard that got the cut from the original game and that section is just awful. The Death Bounce remaster is okay, though I feel the Rover is just kind of bullshit, though arcade space shooters ain’t really my forte.\n\nOverall Making of Karateka is a wonderful documentary and preservation package for a game that has unfortunately not stood the test of time at all. Regardless if you have any interest in video game history I whole-heartedly recommend it. Definitely looking forward to Digital Eclipse possibly making this an entire series and cover games that were influential and actually good, like Doom or Monkey Island. Man, I want a Doom one so bad…",

      "Techland sold out to Tencent. Let this be a reminder to gamers that no matter how beloved your favorite game studio is, sooner or later they'll have a downfall. \n\nI've been a fan of Dying Light since the first game released in 2015. So it pains me to see one of my favorite series' fall like that with the introduction of microtransactions and garbage live service elements. \n\nThe story in DL2 is somehow worse than the original. While DL1's story was pretty generic, at least it wasn't crap. DL2's story is more generic and all of its characters are absolutely obnoxious (except for Hakon). I don't know why western devs and movie makers think writing obnoxious characters is good. Don't get me wrong, you can write an entertaining character who's obnoxious, but in DL2 they characters are just obnoxious, not entertaining. \n\nThe combat gameplay in DL2 feels off. When you swing your melee weapons sometimes they don't connect with zombies right in front of you when they should. And the gore seems broken. Even with the Gut Feeling update. The gore might look good but it doesn't feel like its actually tied to the combat. For example, you could drop kick a human enemy and somehow all of their hands and legs would rip off after hitting a wall which makes no sense. Somehow DL1's gore is more realistic. With DL2 being a Chinese game now I think the gore might get downgraded later on. \n\nI might be a minority on this one but I never really had any complaints about the parkour. I thought it was a definite improvement over the first game and with the Good Night, Good Luck update they improved it even further. I also don't mind the lack of guns in the game. DL was always focused on melee combat and the lack of guns makes the game more challenging whereas in DL1 nighttime became a joke as soon as you got a powerful shotgun where you could also buy ammo for very cheap instead of it being scarce like in Resident Evil. But being OP and shooting volatiles was still fun in its own way NGL. \n\nSpeaking of night, it's laughable how initially Techland completely nerfed the night time experience just to appeal to casuals. Instead of making the night scarier and more complex in DL2 for the millions of fans of DL1 they thought it was a good idea to appeal to people who dropped the game because they were scared of playing a HORROR game. I'm sure the devs had fun wasting their time reworking a core mechanic of the game months after the game was already out when they could've avoided this altogether if they didn't have the bright idea to remove roaming volatiles. But at least they added them back in and made it similar to how it worked in DL1 though it's not perfect yet. It's BS that volatiles NEED to be hit a certain amount of time before they die now. It feels like artificial difficulty. \n\nTo Techland's credit, they did add a community map creation feature which I think more devs should do for their games. Even if DLC2 sucks and Elyseum is never included in the game, fans can now make their own maps and modes and have fun. I hope they keep expanding on this feature. It's also nice that Techland actually listens to feedback and include requested features as soon as they can. They promised at least 5 years of support and before the buyout it really did seem possible. \n\nI really wanted to love Dying Light 2. And I still do to some extent. But the game fails to live up to the first game even over a year after its release. And after the buyout, I don't think this game will ever do. My hype for DLC2 is almost zero. But that's only because I know almost nothing about the DLC except leaks and rumors as Techland didn't announce anything. I really hope this won't affect the updates Techland makes to change the game for the better but at this point I'm not sure anymore.",

      "Minesweeper influenced design feels like a fresh take on the Slay-the-Spire-like genre.  Now that I've won with all six classes, and done some of the unlockable difficulty levels, I feel that I've gotten my money's worth with the game, and I have enjoyed the time I've spent so far, but I don't expect great longevity beyond this point.\n\nI do have some minor gripes:\n\n* The pacing on unlocking new classes feels too slow.  It would be nice if the approach was the fairly standard one of unlocking a new class when you win with the previous one, but here there is a currency which is acquired throughout runs, and I found that I usually had to have two winning runs with the previous class to earn enough currency to unlock a new one.\n* Optimal play with some classes requires memorizing tiles which are revealed, and then on later turns these tiles are hidden.  Taking damage because I misremembered what was hidden behind a tile feels unfun and at-odds with what the game otherwise wants to be.\n* I would prefer if the harder difficulty settings were unlocked from the get-go, rather than grinding through easier difficulty settings to find the challenge.\n\nOtherwise, though, it's a fun game with an adorable art style, and not just a clone of the other Spire-likes around.  Recommended if your expectation is to get ten hours or so of strategic puzzling.",
      "In life, failure is as inevitable as success – this is the underlying principle of great puzzle games. You're equipped with all the tools you need to succeed and it's your responsibility to utilize them effectively to achieve the goals set before you.\n\nHUMANITY places you in control of a luminous Shiba Inu, tasked with guiding hordes of people towards a light that transports them into the unknown. The game unfolds like a series of puzzle boxes, each with a fundamental set of rules: shepherd your humans to the light, prevent them from falling from great heights, and use the provided tools to avert their untimely demise. If navigating the crowds from point A to point B wasn't challenging enough, the game rewards your efforts to collect Goldys – the epitome of human accomplishment – which in turn unlock progress and assistive tools for easier puzzle-solving.\n\nInitially, the toolset is simple, with arrows for direction and commands to jump. These rudimentary tools soon amalgamate into a complex web of commands, making the gameplay increasingly intricate. It would be easy to liken HUMANITY to Lemmings, but doing so would disregard the platform challenges that uniquely define this game. As a player, you'll find yourself questioning how to access certain areas of a level to place commands and realizing that the stream of people you're guiding are also instrumental in your own journey.\n\nThe tranquil aesthetics of HUMANITY are a signature of the team behind Tetris Effect, Child of Eden, Lumines, and REZ. Coupled with the pseudo-futuristic techno music, these visuals create an immersive and cohesive experience, reminiscent of an interactive design studio’s portfolio. The game's sleek aesthetics provide a calming backdrop for the perplexing trials that await you.\n\nThe crafting of a good puzzle game demands talented designers capable of devising some of the most challenging levels. HUMANITY embraces this notion by enabling anyone to create and share their levels, ensuring a constant influx of new challenges from the community.\n\nFans of games like Portal, Baba is You, The Witness, or The Talos Principle will find HUMANITY an easy recommendation. As with those games, failure is not a dead end; instead, it forms part of the learning process propelling you towards success.\n\nHUMANITY is a true Goldy of puzzle games. Underneath its engaging gameplay, it communicates a deeper message – one that resonates with its players, and, much like its puzzles, equips you with enough tools to reach your own conclusions.\n",

No, because of one simple reason:\n\nA lack of content with no mod support.\n\nDuskers is a little like No Man's Sky in the sense that the first few hours are filled with fun and wonder, but everything afterwards becomes a disappointment because the game turns out to be far more shallow than it initially seemed. As a player, I yearned to explore more of the randomly generated galaxy in Duskers because I wanted to see what other horrors, mods, and derelict types I would encounter in the empty universe - but in the end, it turned out that there was really very little else to see besides what you find in the first couple of hours. \n\nHere's a quick rundown of where the content was most lacking:\n\n--Enemy types: there's only 4 different enemies. FOUR. They also behave pretty much identically with the exception of the last one.  This was definitely the biggest interest-killer for me. \n\n--Derelict types end up mattering very little. Government A? Salvage C? Military B? It really doesn't change the layout in a particularly noticeable fashion, with the only differences being 1-2 extra ship defense turrets or something like that. \n\nI really, really wanted to give Duskers a thumbs up - I loved the aesthetic, I loved the atmosphere, and I loved the unique command line interface - but unfortunately, after a few hours, I came to realize that there's really just not enough actual content here, and that's heartbreaking for fans of this niche genre like myself.\n\n",

      "i would say yes there are many bugs especially in the ne update where the cell doors remain open in normal mode and the guards take the new prisoners in the new cells and leave them there handcuffed forever. however this is one of the funnest games iv'e ever bought and it has brought me countless hours of enjoyment, the bugs might be annoying at times but mostly a good restart should do it :). overall i think this game is very worth getting, it lets you play the game how you want to play it and doing so will give you hours of fun as theres always something to do wether its create mor cells or make a execution room. and the mods are great you can really see the creativity in the prisons people have made i would definantly reccomend the checkpoint charlie military prion texture mod too.",
      "An Excelent, well polished shmup(except for one technical fault) with great graphics and music.\n\nNot much to say other than it has fun boss fights with some creative bullet patterns, you have a gauge that fills up and when activated it doubles your fire power, and also you have bombs. If you have bombs and you get hit, you lose all of your bombs instead of just dying straight out, so you essentially have 2 hit points. You have a graze meter as well, meaning that if bullets pass by you it fills that meter up, when it is full, all bullets around you are basically nullified, and any enemy you kill, any bullets it fired at you will also get nullified. When you pass through the nullifeid bullets, it will fill the first gauge I mentioned so you can go ape s**t more often.\n\nIt's fairly simple, but the pace of the game takes a little while to get used to, the speed of your ship releative to the bullets is a little too slow but it's not game breaking. The only major issue is that my controller is not detectable by the game so I have to use joytokey, so I can't make full use of my controllers analog controls.",
      "If you notice that Kagami voice sounds different, that’s because the guy who voiced him in the first game, Brad Venable, died at the beginning of last year. This time, Kagami is voiced by Austin Lee Mathews, who voiced Roche (Final Fantasy VII Remake) and Ash Carbide (Cold Steel III and IV). \n\nRest In Peace, Brad. We may forget Kaniza’s name, but we won’t forget yours. And thank you for being one of the funniest character in the game.",

Very fun and has endless replayibility",
      "Basic game, extremely well done. Like going home and eating your mom's food after decades on the road.\n\nEditing the review to mention some of the flaws of the game:\n- the level design in general is not that great, with every tiny room requiring some mindlessly easy puzzle to be solved first. Eventually it just feels like a chore.\n- not sure if it's something with my steam deck, but I had to put both the game's and the screen's brightness to the max to be able to see things; before that I was constantly missing objects and having trouble with moving around because some soil path looked like a hole in the ground or something.\n- while the game is 2d, there's a lot of different layers of height and depth that get mixed in together and may be hard to tell apart. You often don't know if some platform can be climbed onto or jumped out of until you try to do it.\n- battle system gets repetitive after a while.\n\nDespite those problems, the game is still great and more than make up for those things in other areas.",
      "This is trash, I mean if you eat shit for breakfast I'm sure you'll like it.  You have to pay to have access to graphics better than the PS2's, also your stuff gets deleted every week. All there is to do is punch a couple zombies.  Don't get this game.",
      "Really overrated. Sure the graphics are fancy schmancy, but in the end it feels more like a dumbed-down Left 4 Dead.\n\nPurely from a gameplay perspective, the class specializations are excessively numerous with not that many differences between many of them (and notably, every class can use the same weapons anyway), and the solo mode sucks (no bots, are you kidding me?).\n\nOn other aspects of the game, there is that XP and (cosmetic) items grinding that seems to be the current trend/cash cow. And the fucking ridiculous buying of weapons and ammo within missions because, you know, killing monsters gives you money and in a world completely wrecked by zombies there are automated weapon stores at every corner - seems legit. Feels like that CSGO crap: it's not an FPS as much as a trading \"game\", where you buy stuff ingame and you buy or sell stuff on the Steam marketplace.",

Something to thoughtlessly get addicted to, time and time again. \n\nWe'll probably never see a THPS3+4, but cherish this remake, as it shows a great game with great care put into it. It's made by people who really really love the series, and it shows.\n\nGoogle \"THPS Pro\" to get the 3+4 levels into this as a mod, and keep on getting dunked by the pros in Online.

Exploration is necessary to advance upon it, is unique to each race, and customizable to each player \n+ Crew members can be added to your ship, but I'll say more later \n+ Your own space station can be created for players and NPCs to visit \n+ You can create and fully cutomize a mech to fly through space and stomp along the ground \n+ You can visit and trade inside of other space stations full of NPCs / other players \n+ You can create colonies for NPCs to live in \n+ Treasures can be discovered pretty much anywhere \n+ Tech can give you powers like dashing, jumping, and morphing into a ball \n+ The bosses get harder and are all quite cleverly created \n+ The quests link into the web of connections that advance your tech, systems, and story \n+ Moddable in any way you like, from the intro scene to Robbie Rotten's clothes \n+ Vehicles such as hover bikes and boats are available. \n+ Port forwarding isn't required to host games, your friends can join you through Steam at any time \n+ Tiny easter eggs and hints from the devs can be found throughout the game \n+ It's fairly cheap price-wise, I mean it's a fourth of No Man's Sky and four hundred times better \n+ The soundtrack is beautiful and has brought tears to my eyes more times than I'd like to admit \n+ So many possibilities that can lead to my 700 plus hours on this game \n\nNeutralities \n~ The universe doesn't feel losslessly empty and gigantic, it's fairly easy to get from star to star \n~ Life is extremely abundant \n~ 2D and pixelated; the graphics aren't 'next gen' \n\nCons \n- You can't customize the exterior of your ship \n- Crew members are a little dumb AI-wise and not extremely useful \n- It's a bit slow paced, which a lot people don't like [strike] because they all are stupid and get bored way too fast and don't have the drive to actually work for anything [/strike] but I love it. \n\nTL;DR \n* It's a great space exporation game with a web of slow-ish paced advancement that's extremeley wide in possibilites and customization.\n* Much of the game is unique, including the races, planets, stars, and generated structures. \n* If you don't like it, you probably don't like space games :p",
      "One of the best platformer/Beat-them-up just got upgraded. new attacks, new enemies, new bosses, new levels, new modes, new skins and a graphical improvement, this is really worth getting if you didn't play the original version. if you have the original you get a 66% discount which is good but i still think it should be an optional DLC that sells for 2 Dollars. of course i understand many people won't buy it because they played the original and they shouldn't buy it, but as for me its just that i wanted a reason to replay Guacamelee again so i bought this.",
      "WARNING. This game is pure drug. Don't buy unless You have no kids, no wife and You have a lot free time.

At some point You may experience unexpected dreams about high tech and well tuned factories.\n\nEarly Access in this case means something similar to never ending story. When You think \"I have done everything\" new update shows up and You're starting doing mess again.\n\nI can only have reservations about the multiplayer mode, where there are funny glitches, disappearing objects, self-propelled vehicles, lack of character synchronization, etc. However, this does not prevent having continuous fun in the co-op mode.\n\nI hope You like it so much as I did.\n\nEDIT: Still thinking of buying it?

      "It's more of a mixed recommendation but the positives outweigh the negatives if you're a returning fan.\n\nEverything in the game that's an adaptation of the original FF7, I love.  It gave me major nostalgia vibes to walk through a gorgeously rendered versions of FF7's environments.  The combat is much more engaging - no more watching a tv show on the side while I button-mash another random encounter.  Many of the big story moments still hit and I found even more to love in the characters based on their performances going beyond text boxes and blocky animations.  Even the music is just top-notch.  The OST will be a mainstay in my playlist for years.  It feels like I'm seeing the old game with fresh eyes and remembering why it made such an impact.\n\nThat said, the new content feels like a filler arc in a beloved anime.  Your character falls into a random hole like 3-4 times, spends 2 hours fighting random baddies, and then walks out like \"right, so back to that thing I was doing.\"  I don't even know if a new player could understand wtf is happening with Sephiroth because he's never really introduced and certain essential events are never explained.  It tries to take some clever left-turns on the plot so returning players have new surprises to enjoy but it often feels pretentious and pointless.  The ending gave me flashbacks to Peter Jackson's Hobbit trilogy because of how unnecessarily forced it was and the sudden cartoon levels of action.\n\nI'm tentatively enthusiastic for the sequel but there's a few troubling signs I hope don't become a trend.",
      "I keep seeing all these negative reviews comparing the game to Dark souls, so i'd like to set this straight:\n\nThis. Game. Isn't. Dark. Souls.\n\nIf you play this game like you would a dark souls game you would not have any fun, I know this because I spent the first 30 hours playing it like a Dark souls game and wasn't enjoying it.\nIn order to play this game how it is supposed to be played you need to start investing more in learning combos for your character, different techniques and items to use.  Each weapon has a unique set of combos you can invest in.  When you learn how to use these combos, you'll find that enemies who were infuriating to fight against being defeated much easier and the game becomes more challenging and fun over frustrating.\n\nSummery: This game isn't Dark Souls, So stop playing it like it is Dark souls!\nHighly recommend! \n\n\n",
      "This is more than a game for me.  It has become a hobby.  What started as a random purchase for myself last Christmas -- I had an old electric guitar I never played in the closet, so this gave me an excuse to see if I can learn -- has become an expensive obsession for me.  Warning -- but a good warning -- you'll find that you're learning guitar very quickly on this game, and it will become the start of an expensive habit!  I have downloaded hundreds of dollars worth of songs, bought a brand new guitar, I've signed up for music theory and guitar lessons at the local county college ... this has become a genuine hobby for me.  Literally, it is one of those rare games which has genuinely made an impact on my life.  Six months later, and the game has not gotten old.  I look forward to new songs, I laugh when a new chord I've never seen magically appears on the song that I've practiced the hell out and achieved a new difficulty.  The game is, most importantly, fun.  It remains fresh and only gets better as you get better.  I highly recommend.",
      "Was a bit turn off when I saw it was a stationary shooter, but the game is so fun I look past that and even began to enjoy the room scaling dodging mechanics (game can make you work up a sweat!).\n\nA must for anyone looking for a more intense arcade shooting experience. I cannot overstate how fun it is to build your weapons in VR, the crafting system works flawlessly and seemely without the need of menus or UIs getting in the way, props for the devs for how well the game integrates with VR controls.\n\nWhat I liked:\n- Varied enemies\n - Great VR controls\n- Gun crafting is addicting and allows for a lot of experimentation\n- Great Bosses\n\nWhat I had trouble with:\n- Makes you wish you could run around the rooms like the original game!\n- The reduced FOV of most VR headsets makes it quite difficult to keep track of enemies that come from multiple directions. Some rooms require so much head movement that I tend to get sick.\n- When a room spawns with multiple shield pylons and a healer bot, it gets extremely frustrating if you have slow moving projectile weapons.\n\nWishes:\n- More gun parts! (Maybe future DLC?)",
      "You finally don't need a guide on how to purchase the game.\n\n- 21 different story missions that each take approximately 20 to 50 minutes to complete.\n- DLC sidestory contracts - different targets but same maps.\n- Escalation contracts on those same maps; think of this as a puzzle mode.\n- The new roguelike Freelancer mode that gives randomly generated targets in a randomly generated campaign.\n\nThis game now has such a vast wealth of content that it would take you months to complete it all. I genuinely recommend it.",
      "Excellent game, but has an awful-abrupt ending that comes out of nowhere and doesnt make sense and leaves way too many plot elements unexplained.\n\nIn the last game they introduce a secret society of energy sucking vampires that are hunting Rosa and Joey yet they are never mentioned again and instead the end of series villian is some random messed up ghost that randomly has end of the world magic powers.\n\nAwful.",

If you like Empire-builders, this game is for you!\n\nIgnore the \"Early access\". This game is ready to be sold.

      "it's a shame but i honestly cannot recommend this game if you are a disabled person, i wasn't that far into the game when my character started panicking apon seeing a disabled person [person with leg braces] and then gets a \"no good answer\" bit of dialog and all the options are saying something wrong or saying nothing, trying to go with the least bad option aside from saying nothing since i know as a disabled person myself [i'm a wheelchair user] it can be pretty upsetting getting people just randomly stare at me and at least when they say something slightly wrong they are engaging with me as a person, my character then proceeds to talk abt what an \"inspiration\" it is 2 c a disabled person living their life,,, not exaggerating when i say i let my head hit the desk, closed the game and uninstalled, i understand that this is probably put in the game to be a teachable moment for the able bodied audience but ironically in trying to educate about us disabled people they then made the assumption that no disabled people would be playing their game as there is no option to make your character disabled or even to make them remotely aware of disability and ended up just making the experience awful for the disabled gamers they seem to be trying to help",

      "I was a playtester on this game, and I can say with authority, love and joy and care all radiate out of the work that was put into making this game. It still has the same Psychonauts wackiness and great comedy, but it's also become more mature, more understanding, more willing to tackle dark topics head on and acknowledge that human beings are flawed, and need help, and make mistakes, and sometimes even do awful things. But Psychonauts 2 understands that human beings aren't defined by any of this, and that people can learn from their wrongs and can change for the better. And it tells all this through a delicious array of gorgeous, varied mental landscapes, through creative collectibles that reveal the memories, loves, and regrets of the colorful cast, and through a combat and platforming system that is much improved from its predecessor. I can't recommend this game enough. It's an emotional triumph.",
      "I'm going to write an honest review for this game since A LOT of people seem to be very biased.\n\nThis is not a perfect game. No 2K basketball game will ever be a perfect game. Does that mean this game is bad? No. Should you hold off on the game for now? Probably.\n\nLet's start with the positives:\n\n- A lot of people seem to gloss over the fact that 2K rehauled a lot of mechanics for this game. Shot meters feel more legitimate, this game is MUCH much more realistic (fouls, shot tendencies, etc...) This game is better and more fluid to control, and the gameplay reflects each players' ratings (defense, shots, etc...) much more accurately.\n\n- Online play seems to be better and more fluid. I've yet to encounter any latency issues online with quick play and the such.\n\n- MyCareer is MUCH better than last years. There is no cheesy story and the cutscenes feel much more integrated into the game. Orange Juice and dynamic duos are a great idea in general. The UI for MyCareer (and the game in general) is so much cleaner and more functional.\n\n- The game is visually beautiful, not much else to say on the matter.\n\nNow, the cons:\n\n- Help defense is broken. It's quite ridiculous that 2K hasn't fixes this lingering issue in such a long time but it's still there. This is a BIG issue in MyCareer and not quite as bad in other modes since you can manually control players.\n\n- Stat allocation is broken. This is a huge issue in MyCareer and has deterred me from playing the mode any more until 2K fixes this issue. Introducing the idea of stats that can only be raised in practice is actually quite a neat idea. However, these boosts are not permanent, even though 2K has stated they are. This is detrimental and demoralizing and discourages players from playing the game more. Limit caps are ridiculously strict as well. 2K NEEDS to fix these issues ASAP.\n\n- Numerous glitches.\n\n- 2K introduced broken mechanics along with the good mechanics. Ankle breakers are now pathetically easy to pull off (using Stephen Curry behind the back moves is a surefire way to have your defender fall). Moving screens are now a thing. \n\nI would hold off on buying this game until 2K patches it. There are just too many issues with the game that prevent it from being a playable game. I like this game. I really do. That's why I'm hoping 2K listens to the community and starts working on the issues at hand immediately.",
      "Okay so,\n\nFirst off, the Streaming of the game play yesterday did this title zero favours. Whoever made the decision to allow a copy of the game which was 400 builds behind to be live streamed made a mistake.\n\nThe character creation is a nice touch, makes you think and get involved with it characteristics of the nation you pick to play as. I like this and rarely see stuff like this in game.\n\nThe Steam page states 'SuperPower 3 is tailor-made for all the megalomaniacs out there who are convinced they can do a much better job at running the world than real politicians and military leaders across the globe'. That's a rather bold statement for a game that has 5 or 6 laws you can change for a whole country...., \n\nOverall the game in its current state is incredibly basic and lacks any depth in regards to the actual management and running of a country. No parliaments behind a leader etc, why? Even the excuse of the focus is around you and your characters decisions doesn't make much sense. It takes away the feeling of running a country, that which you are describing in the games description. Where are the ministers, the scandals that come with the running of a country?\n\nThe game isn't a write off, I personally feel it will be good in time but looks to be missing alot. Overall 5/10. Product refunded.",

This is BY FAR the best visual novel i have played. the old school forums and cameras feel very detailed as whenever anything happens in a video chat, no matter how small, the characters react to it. the story was very enthralling and every time i slipped up and made a wrong move, my heart would feel as though it was gonna beat out of my chest. talking to violet felt very real and made the ending that i got so much more satisfying. the only bad things i can even say about this absolute masterpiece is just the fact that most of the really impact full options were locked because \"Emmett isn't cocky enough\" or  \"Emmett isn't compassionate enough\" which felt very vague and confining.\n\noverall the game is absolutely amazing and i wish the devs would come out with a game similar to this because of how good it was.\n9/10",
      "I'm a bit torn on giving Guacamelee! Super Turbo Championship Edition (STCE) a thumbs down, but I feel it's important for prospective buyers/players to know that STCE is significantly worse than Guacamelee! Gold Edition. \n\nSTCE brings a number of modifications to Guacamelee, all of which are negative (apart from the 4P support). First, there are two large new areas, both of which serve as filler, breaking the flow of the game while not introducing any new concepts. Arguably the best part of the second area is the new character that serves as a boss, but said boss fight is relatively simple and the character takes focus away from the stronger original cast. Secondly are the combat changes: the \"rebalancing\" of enemies and the Intenso power. Javiar Jaguar, the stand-out boss from the original game, has been nerfed to an absolute pushover. Moreover, the Intenso power is absolutely game breaking, making every combat encounter in the game a joke. That wouldn't be so bad if you could ignore it, but the developers added certain combat encounters where the difficulty goes through the roof if Intenso isn't used (rooms with multiple enemies with white shields, hitstun-immunity, and/or non-dodgable attacks).  These rooms generally feature Intenso-refilling barrels or enemies as well, so the intention is clear. Of course, there's plenty of Intenso to go around even for easier rooms and bosses, trivializing combat entirely. \n\nIn short, STCE is still a good game, but the original release was a GREAT game, without the broken combat \"rebalancing\" and padding. Please buy/play Guacamelee! Gold instead.",
      "I have a serious love/hate relationship with Sea of Thieves. It is both one of the best games I have ever played and one of the most frustrating games I have ever played, all wrapped into one. The gameplay of Sea of Thieves is INCREDIBLE. The sailing is the best in any game I have ever played. The feeling of exploration and discovery as you blast through treasure hunts and puzzles and mysteries is unlike any feeling you can get from any other game. The cooking mechanic, the healing from food, the not-terrible fishing mechanic... all subsystems that prop up the rest of the gameplay are unique and interesting in their own right. The land-based combat is relatively uninspired, yet still satisfying when part of the greater picture that the game presents. Some of my favorite memories in gaming, full stop, come from completing long nights on the high seas or doing long-form content available in the game. The game is gorgeous, some of the best ocean/water graphics in any game. The rest of the game is equally beautiful while perfectly conveying the environment of the map you are in. I swear to Gaben that I can freaking smell the wet sand or sulfurous lava on some of these islands. The music and sound design are some of the best in the industry. Outright, the game is incredible. \n\nBUT... Sea of Thieves sweaties ruin the game for me. There is absolutely nothing worse than having a night full of fun absolutely destroyed by some player who's enjoyment of the game is derived from eliminating anyone else's fun. I understand that PvP is part of the \"pirate life\", but it is by far the worst part of the game by far. I would be willing to pay money, hell a freaking monthly subscription, for the opportunity to play SoT as a strictly PvE game with just my friends and the rest of the server populated by bots. I actively avoid playing the game now because of how many of my last play sessions started with me spawning at an outpost and subsequently being sunk less than 15 feet off the dock by some sweaty that hasn't seen sunlight since the Obama administration. I know that this is an incredibly unpopular opinion in the greater SoT-sphere, but part of the enjoyment of games is letting players enjoy them how they wish, and I really freaking wish that I could enjoy the aspects of SoT that are fun to me without being the plaything of those pirates who live only to ruin the fun of others.",

      "Before I continue writing my review on this game, I got to say that the PC port of Valkyria Chronicles is one of the best, if not, [u]the[/u] best port. The game was originally exclusive for the PlayStation 3 back in 2008. The game was well received, but garnered low sales that would put the sequels Valkyria Chronicles 2 and 3 on the PSP. I actually never heard of this game before until a few week prior to the PC release on November 2014. That said, I will have to give a standing ovation to Sega for putting an effort to make the PC port well optimized in 1080p (or more) at 60 FPS (or more). Sega has my attention and I will present this review.\n \nValkyria Chronicles focuses on Welkin Gunther, a son of a legendary general who fought in the First Europan War, leads a platoon of some adults and teenage volunteers to defend their country against the invading forces of the Imperial Alliance. The game presents a mix of tactical strategy and third-person action that is very unique in the strategy game genre. Does this game deserve your attention? \n\nThe story takes place in a “fictional” European continent where the Second Europan War was fought primarily between the Atlantic Federation (think of all of the European countries, in a geographical sense) versus the Imperial Alliance (Russia, in a geographic sense). Gallia is a “neutral” country where it contains a unique resource known as Ragnite. Thus, the Imperial Alliance invade Gallia to get Ragnite to fuel up their war resources. One of the greatest parts about the game is how well the developers use analogies from World War II into the game and its execution is well-received. The analogies ranged from weapon designs (like the Gallian Scout weapons that look like the Soviet SVT-40 to the Imperial weaponry comparison to the real-life MP40 and STG44, and plenty others). The analogy extends to vehicles and geopolitical conflicts. \n\nThe character developments in the game are highly impressive, particularly with the relationship between Welkin (protagonist) and Alicia Melchiott (deuteragonist). The themes in Valkyria Chronicles consist a good mix of “light” moments (like hope as an example) and “semi-grotesque” themes of war (such as discrimination/racism, personal ambition over soldiers’ lives, and others themes that will unravel later on). Some reviewers criticized the game as being not serious on the themes about war. Honestly, I don’t think that the game is supposed to be depressing and a good mix between “light” and “dark” is best suited for the game. The story starts really slow in the beginning and actually begin to progress as you reach a certain point in the story. The plot is pretty good in most area while few scenes are a bit “awkward” in terms of sudden shifts between a sad event to a “positive motivation”. \n\nThe gameplay in Valkyria Chronicles is turn-based, but it is very unique because once you click on a character to choose, you can actually control the character to move to any location in third-person you like as long you have enough Action Points (basically, the movement bar). Experience points and money are earned by Ranks (like A, B, C, and D) by completing an objective within a certain number of turns (Example: Getting a ‘A’ rank within 3 turns or less to get the maximum amount of exp and money). However, it is possible that you can actually kill all of the enemies on the map, complete the objective, and still get an ‘A’ rank in the majority of missions (except for a few of them). \n\nWith the exp and money, you train your soldiers based on classes Scout, Shocktrooper, Lancer (Anti-Tank/Explosives), Engineers, and Sniper rather than individuals. The money are used up to upgrade weapons, buy tank parts, and purchasing “reports” from a reporter in certain chapters in the story. The game would last you a good 30-50 hours if you play the game in a smart, tactical manner or have an “OCD” on getting an “A” rank on every single mission in the story or a mix of both (like I did). \n\nThe game does have some faults, particularly when it comes to classes. Reviewers argued that Scouts are too overpowered, but in my view, it is best to say that scouts are too reliable since they have the most movement bar and top-tier weapons like the ZM Kar 8 (the game's version of Soviet PTRS-41 that can obliterate any enemy, even medium and heavy tanks if you shoot it in the back). Engineers are useless in the game since you won’t repair your tank very often (depending on your play style) and Scouts are the better alternative. There are some bugs in the game that is related to the monitor refresh rate (if you play it on a 144 Hz monitor like I did) in certain missions in the story. PC controls are a bit awkward when you control the tank. There are a few moments in the story that has some poor “transitions” (an example would be that an upsetting moment happened in the story and all of a sudden, some of the major characters wanted a medal for their part on a major battle in the next cutscene as if that upsetting moment never happen or affected them). \n\nThe game is often compared to XCOM when it comes to gameplay. This may be true, but Valkyria Chronicles is very unique since you can actually control the character in third person instead of the computer doing it for you when you command the character to move from Point A to B, in bird’s eye view. The game engine is very aesthetic and presents the story very well. I’m glad the Sega released Valkyria Chronicles to the PC and I am very pleased to hear that a (possible) new Valkyria Chronicles game is being trademarked (and hopefully in development) thanks to the PC sales. The default price of $20 is a good deal, -50% off is a great deal, -75% is a perfect steal. Valkyria Chronicles is one of my top games for 2014 due to its unique strategy gameplay and superb PC port optimization. I am looking forward for the new game that is being trademarked (or possible PC ports or revamp for VC2 and 3). This game has my highest recommendation for any strategy gamer who want to find something original, unique, and beautiful.",

      "This is such a great game. It's a well put together survival game with many things to do. Whether you want to just build a sandbox wilderness empire or try to escape, it's entirely fun no matter what. I've tried to actually complete the game, but I always end up building a massive epic fortress complete with my very own beefalo farm. The only thing that I personally don't like about this game is the stumble-upon style of actually completing the quests (they're not really quests, but I can't think of anything else to call them). Other than that, this game is a beautiful masterpiece. Very artistic, creative and fun. I definitely recommend it to anyone who loves survival games of any sort.",
      "PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE VENTURING INTO 999!\n\n\n\nI refunded the game thinking they removed so much of the narrative but I was wrong, the game has now 2 different types of screens, the \"ADV screen\" and the \"Novel screen\". Make sure you switch to \"Novel screen\" as soon as you start playing and stay on that screen as the \"ADV screen\" only displays dialogue and NOTHING ELSE, if you stay on this screen you'll miss all the extra bits that can help to figure out certain details that allow you to find all the endings and figure out the entire story top to bottom.\nHappy gaming.\n\nEDIT: @Snivader pointed out my mistake, edited the review.\n\n\n\nExtra small tip to help you through your journey. Take a notepad (or anything you can scribble down onto), and write down key dates / codes / people that you encounter through the game and keep them close while playing the entire trilogy. I can guarantee you that your mind will be blown by the end of the trilogy (provided you can keep up with the weird events that go down in these games).",
      "I came across Dreamscaper after playing 200 hours of Hades. I was looking for similar games that could recapture some of the magic of discovery and progression that made Hades such a delightful experience.\n\nDreamscaper is not Hades. There probably isn't any game that can measure up to the experience of playing Hades, and there probably won't be for a long while. But a lot of the same elements are there, and I did really enjoy Dreamscaper for what it was.\n\nThe \"story\" in Dreamscaper is more of a personal journey. There aren't really \"events occurring\" so much as a character working through her issues. The supporting characters are fairly interesting, though not quite on par with the literally larger-than-life dynamic personalities of Hades. But to be fair, the characters in Dreamscaper are ordinary folks, not mythological deities.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the game is \"nostalgic.\" It's an exploration of the protagonist's childhood memories, so that makes sense. There is a very different energy here than Hades' cheeky and horny angst. It's more sad and calm.\n\nIn terms of the feel of playing the game, Dreamscaper has a lot of similarities to Hades. There is a varied arsenal of different weapons and abilities, progression through randomized levels with boss fights, a wide selection of permanent character upgrades to purchase using resources gathered during runs, a relationship system to grow closer with the characters, etc. Unlike Hades, every aspect of your loadout can change throughout a run: you can swap out weapons and abilities as you encounter new and better ones along the way. It's both more flexible than Hades and less; you're not locked in to one weapon for the entire run, and there are many more weapons and abilities (and combinations thereof); but with more randomness comes less control, so it's a lot harder to craft and hone a particular build in Dreamscaper than in Hades. A lot of the \"builds\" are elemental damage modifiers, in which all you're trying to do is find a bunch of gear that (say) deals Lightning damage or increases your Lightning damage dealt. The upgrades are largely \"number get bigger,\" and while it can be satisfying to get a bunch of cool multipliers, it does feel less \"combo\"y or \"breakable\" than Hades (though there are certainly some very powerful and broken-feeling builds you can end up with).\n\nThe gameplay is challenging, like Hades, though perhaps slightly less. Like Hades, a lot of your ability to clear rooms and defeat bosses effectively comes from learning their attack patterns and timings. I do wish there were more variety to the enemies, as many of them are just \"the guy from the last level but he is stronger and has more abilities now\" (though that criticism applies to Hades as well). The boss fights are by and large much easier once you learn their patterns, though there are still a few that can be tough for certain builds. The \"hard version\" of bosses are definitely a force to be reckoned with, though.\n\nThe art and music are attractive and inviting. It's much more The Sims than Guilty Gear, but in a way that fits the atmosphere nicely. It's stylized in a very different way than Hades, but it works in its own way.\n\nThe developers are also very community-oriented and are responsive to community input through their Discord. The Hades developers probably are too, but I have no direct experience interacting with them.\n\nSo in conclusion, if you liked Hades because of its horny angst, badass metal riffs, mythological themes, and bloody humor, you may not have much interest in Dreamscaper. But if you liked Hades because of its randomized runs, variety of weapons and builds, feeling of progression, challenging boss fights, and dynamic cast of characters with complicated relationships, then you should absolutely pick up Dreamscaper. And if you didn't like Hades, then you probably stopped reading this review after the first paragraph.",

So for being the best implementation of the Robotron idea to date it gets a big thumbs up!\n\nSuggestions where it could be improved:\n[list]\n    [*]Graphics are so pretty they do sometimes make it hard to see what's going on.

      "I would recommend ARK only in 1 specific case – you have a group of friends and will play on a private/local server. You get to enjoy the game at your own pace, with modified server multipliers, without the worry of PvP and server-dominating tribes. Graphics are great, the world is beautiful, lots of cool dinos to tame. There’s a lot to do, to build, to explore, to figure out.\n\nBut playing on a large PvP server is horrible experience. You are at a mercy of alpha tribes that have everything and can do anything. Slow progression, server wipes, laggy combat, so much grinding to catch up just to have your base destroyed while offline. Maybe you could find some servers where all this is more balanced but even then, it just becomes a game of who can grind more. It’s just not something I would ever recommend.",

      "This is easily one of the funniest games I played in 2017.  In the 20 hours it took me to solve it the first time, I pretty much did nothing else until I had finished it, despite the fact that I was supposed to be studying.\n\nThe game is set in absurd western themed world where humour is so baked into the fabric of everything that there is virtually nothing that isn't some kind of joke.  This could easily fall flat if it were poorly written, but I found the writing to be fantastic.  Obviouslly humour is subjective so if you aren't onboard with it's humour you proably won't get much out of it.  For everyone else you are due for a hell of a ride as the game is an absolute hoot.\n\nThe game takes place in a kind of openinsh world with your character setting out from a location on their horse. You can either select to \"Wander\" in which case you will make a broad loop out and around, potentially unovering new map locations or encountering a random encounter.  You can also direct travel to locations you have found and will also be told about map locations from NPC's or as the outcomes of various quests.    The world is feels quite expansive with a lot of interesting locations to explore.  There are a couple of central plot quests to pursue and a bunch of side quests as well.  In my 20 hour playthrough I managed to complete the main story but still had a few side things Id managed to miss all the clues for.\n\nCombat in the game takes place in a turn based format that should feel familiar to anyone has played a JRPG before.  You stand on one side, your foes tand on the other and you select your various attacks and abilities from a list specific to each characters class.  As you gain XP  you can choose what skills you buy so you can tailor your character to your play style, with higher skill levels costing increasing amounts of XP.  You can further personalise your character with a swathe of various equiment, almost all of which is humorous and absurd.  The combat is not particularly complex but its good enough and the humour is so good that it really does the heavy lifting for keeping you engaged.\n\nAs you can see from the screenshots the graphics portray everything in stick figures, but everything is surpisingly detailed and the great animation and the little touches really add to the charm of world.  A still screenshot doesn't really do justice to how much fun this game is to see in motion.\n\nThe music and sound are suprisingly good too, with twangy guitars and banjos mixed with good old time whistling and other wild west sounding stuffness.  Once again is better than you have any right to expect from such an overtly daft title and between the lively graphics and relelentless humour It's just another layer of polish to draw you into the games odd version of the wild west.\n\nLook I flat out loved this game. It was a delight. As I said, your milage may vary if the humour doesn't tickle your funny bone but I can tell you now, never have I laughed so hard at a game as I did digging through the spitoons in West of Loathing.\n\nGold.\n\n9 out of 10",
      "[h1] Look at my hours real quick. That's about. 4 hours? [/h1]\n\nFallout 76 is boring. There's no other way to put it. The Core objective of Fallout 76 was to gear the Fallout 4 engine for multiplayer. They succeeded! The art is visually amazing, even down to the 2D art shown all over this store page, so what's wrong?\n\nConsider who's still playing this game. Who's desperate enough to play this game? Well, It's not a lot of people. And they aren't very good people. It's just people. Existing. I had 0 conversations during my 4 hours. \n\nLets talk playing. The game is boring. Since I just mentioned the objective, lets talk about the NPC's ETC. [b] I got this game for free, I cannot emphasize how little this game means to me. It's terrible. [/b] The NPC's & story were not part of core development therefore the game suffers. You get stuck doing some quests you don't care about and play a game you'd rather not play. The NPC's are essential as expected so, you cannot kill them either. \n\nMicrotransactions Via Atomic Shop & Premium plague the game [i] but lets talk about more! [/i] There's free events like a crate dropping & player trading outposts. Wanna know what's wrong here? The game boils down to, find a player trading outpost and buy sh*t, or just dropping crates? well the crates are full of nothing. the games gear-towards premium really gives you nothing in terms of loot so you're playing what is a hollow, unfinished, boring, game. Even in 2021! \n\nCreatures & enemies are cool however there's a big issue of the game not being cool. You may say its worth it to play just to engage the wild-life but even they feel soul-less and void of life. I don't know how you make a game so devoid of soul really.

Interested. I sat for 4 hours, wanting to tear my hair out and scream, because I was so bored. I had tests in school, more interesting than this.

There's no manual save because the game saves automatically every loop. So, you might be nearing the end of exploring a cave system, with just one more objective to scout, and... whoosh... back to the start.  This forces you to retrace your steps and cover old ground again and again and again because you won't be fully exploring anywhere in 22 mins.\n\nThe controls (Keyboard/Mouse) are awful.

The game was clearly made for console, and doesn't translate well to PC.\n\nWhen you do get your head around the clunky controls, the 'realistic' physics adds nothing to the game except to create a keyboard-smashing level of frustration. Navigating space and/or the landscapes in this game is a mix of falling, crashing, ricocheting, overshooting, and generally wasting time to get where you want to go.\n\nIronically, despite promising to be a space exploration game, the navigation difficulty, the constant race against the loop reset, and race against other timed game elements, actually discourages exploration, and often punishes you for doing so.\n\nI thought I was buying a relaxing, cerebral story-driven journey with puzzles to solve. Instead I got a spelunking jumping, crashing simulator, the point of which seems to be gathering a jumble of fragmented story elements, jigsaw fashion, discovering a little bit more each loop. The 'puzzles' are all about navigating the locations, often time-dependant, to unlock more story elements.\n\n\nPerhaps there is a wonderful endgame that I will never get to experience... but I can't force myself through any more tedious, frustrating loops to get there.",
      "Heard joke once: Man goes to doctor. Says he's depressed. Says life seems harsh and cruel. Says he feels all alone in a threatening world where what lies ahead is vague and uncertain. Doctor says, \"Treatment is simple. Steam is having a sale tonight. Go buy a game. That should pick you up.\" Man siles. Says to Doctor, \"good idea, Doc! A nice relaxing distraction!\" Man goes home. Man buys DF.\n\nGood joke. Everybody laugh.\n\n\n\nBut seriously, I built a working moat with a remote drainage system control tower and a 4 storey above ground fort, becoming a thriving 200-strong hold of what was once a moribund empire of less than 10 dwarves. 100/10 game that is definitely worth the learning curve.",

      "Took me a while to play this because there were some critical bugs during release day, but the devs worked hard to fix everything up.\n\nNow, this is the premium version of Mad Father which is not just a straight re-release of the free version, but an upgraded one (in many ways, I'm told). Better graphics, better level design, better everything. It's a really tight experience without any filler and with an interesting story, so any fans of RPGMaker-type horror games will find this a highly enjoyable experience.\n\nYou can also increase the game's window size, so don't worry if you're running a high-resolution display. This is a feature that is not exactly common for these types of games, but this game has got you covered.\n\nI'm looking forward to future games from the dev!",

      "this game is something i have literally always wanted but never thought would exist. a historical fiction narrative that isn't about war or combat but rather something as mundane as being a maid... AND they let you actually clean the rooms. i have been asking for this for years and years and then these psychopaths go and actually make it?? unfathomable. love it. my only critique is that I can't high five Eugene or take Wendy to the malt shop to help her feel better\n\nin seriousness it's not the most wildly divergent choice-based narrative of all time (there are small choices throughout that have an impact, but most of the consequence is delayed so it doesn't FEEL as impactful in the moment), which might put off some people who want a more sandbox feeling. consider it more of a detective game than an RPG. worth experiencing even if you don't have my particular brand of mental illness tho, 100%, especially if you like these kinds of games in general.",

      "[i]While the artwork and combat remain enjoyable, the story, writing, and pacing were a major letdown.[/i]  \n\n***\nMINOR SPOILERS BELOW. If you're going to play the game, play before reading.\n***\n\n[b]The mature storylines, hard-hitting decisions, beautiful worldbuilding, and tight writing that made the first two so immersive is not present in this game.[/b] (You'll notice immediately that the writing for the caravan in the capital is [i]particular[/i] trite, awkward to read, and uninteresting.)\n\nUnfortunately, it's not just the writing that's weak. [i]The pacing is off.[/i] Antecedents are confusing, characters you'd expect to speak don't, events that should have been foreshadowed come out of nowhere. More frustrating are the serious character continuity \"errors,\" and arcs that disappear, change, or go nowhere. [i]In short, the events, decisions, and conflict from the previous games do not appear or resolve in a way that was suggested by the previous two[/i].\n\n\nHere's one example. In Banner Saga 2, Fosolt is unexpectedly rescued by Bolverk. [i]\"I have a message for Alette from the dead varl king,\" [/i]he said. That's pretty intriuging! Maybe there's a mystery, an oracle, an item, or just cool information about the Varl and their strange king? Maybe there'll finally be context about the bridge decision!\n\n[i]No! He has nothing interesting to say or add, and then his storyline just gets dropped and forgotten.[/i]\n\nWell, Bolverk's been possessed by Bellower! Gosh, who knows what Bellower will say? In fact, I can't wait to find out what happens to Bellower's body! \n\nWell, actually, Bolver's [i]not[/i] possessed, not really, certainly not like it was implied last game, and Bellower's body -- [i]a primary focus of the first two games[/i] -- isn't mentioned [i]once[/i]\n\nOr how about how they casually mention that Eyvyn is not only the [i]head[/i] of the Valka order, but also that he's had periodic bursts of hereditary madness all along? That's... odd. And it's not presented as an well-thought out [i]reveal[/i] or anything. It's presented matter-of-factly, like they were trying to ret-con in a less interesting story, or were tone deaf.\n\nYou'll notice that all the characters are underutilized and have unfulfilled storylines/tensions. Hakon has hard choices to make; Canary's a little crazy; Yrsa is mysterious; Gil's in love with Alette, etc. Will these build into choices? Reveals? Dependent endings based on choices? Will there be discussions referencing the past? Reflections on travels? Hints of despair?\n\nNo. In mine, Gil was [i]murdered[/i] and no one even bothered to reference it. Canary's situation never comes to a head. You never have to choose between Varls and Humans. Murdering people doesn't make people threaten to leave. Ubin returns randomly as an uber Varl and he's... learned the horseborne's language? Travelled the southlands? In like, a month? In a way that doesn't advance the plot? It's just... weakly done.\n\n\nThere are [i]so many[/i] examples like this, where the stories don't quite fit correctly, where what you picked up on in the early games about the [i]mysteries[/i] and the [i]world[/i] and what made it a [i]vibrant[/i] place were forgotten about by the writers. [b]The result is that it the game plays out in unsatisfying ways, in tenseless scenarios made vapid by watered-down morality, an inability to leverage the situation in fun ways, and low-quality writing, paucity of choice-making, a lack of exploration, lack of plot twists, simplified overworld mechanics -- all culminating in an almost staggeringly one-dimensional and shallow ending.[/b]\n\nThe Banner Saga series was always an experience that was greater than the sum of its part. An [i]experience[/i]. Of being [i]riveted[/i] to the computer, checking the map, worrying over supplies, guessing at mysteries, having my breath taken away at each hill. Unfortunately, that's not the case in this game. \n\n\nGameplay-wise, it's also a bit of a letdown. Combat is fun-ish, but you can make invincible character combinations and the mechanics don't even try to deal with this. There's an interesting new reinforcement mechanic that's not used heavily, and never pushes you like you think the end of the world would. You never really have to split up your forces. There's no novelty. Like maybe using a hero in a battle makes them fatigued, so you have to switch them up? Maybe you can station them different places, making them unusable for combat? Maybe you need to choose eight for a secret mission caravan? Maybe dream sequences? No, nothing like that. \n\nThe overworld gameplay had some changes that never really felt significant. Moreover, quite a bit felt taken away. You can't rest, do training missions, no longer weigh food vs upgrades. One example of all thise tone deafness was Iver's march through the destroyed world was consistently at \"Great Morale!\"\n\nThere didn't seem to be many flavor choices (\"Do we hang the criminals or let them join us?\"), including much less on social themes (\"Should women fight, if it disturbs the traditionally-minded men?\" \"One clan's rowdy, what do we do?\" \"They threaten to leave if so and so isn't banished\"), and less delayed results and fewer significant decisions, including among the game's built-up tensions among the factions. \n\n\nThere's also some cases of development [i]feeling[/i] cheap. Remember opening Banner Saga 2, and feeling that it was [i]fresh[/i], and [i]upgraded[/i]? There's little to make you feel that way here. The artwork is okay, but the environments feel more generic, with less variety, and the surreal landscapes in the darkness aren't especially interesting to look at for long periods of time. Iver is voiced by Bolverk's voice actor, and they sound exactly the same. The new title system is a fun idea, but is visually integrated into the game's menu system with the finesse of a cheap mod. \n\nThere's a moment in the game where the screen goes black for scrolling text and voiceover narration explaining the upcoming mechanic. Um, a character can't explain that? It was similar how the many two second animations are used, not to supplement the story, but to [i]replace[/i] written portions, making you feel unsure about what's going on. And finally, the game's pretty short, without fun combat challenges or interesting newgame+ challenges. \n\n\nWhat's [i]particularly[/i] frustrating is that the game's release date was moved forward four months. I don't know the story why, but I do know that a few more months of polish and story embellishment might have delivered the beautiful, grippingly interactive story we were hoping for. Because this is a watered down version of the previous two in just about every way.\n\nThis negative review is for whatever processes lead to this mediocre finale.\n\n---\n\n[i]Here's a plot that would have made more sense. Zephyr arrives and speaks to you secretly. There's a god that's still alive! Neat, now we'll finally get more story on that. Yay, fun caravan mode, now we need to take longships somewhere interesting!\n\nBut uh-oh! There's a Sundr villain going there as well, with an army of dredge! But at least now we'll finally get more story about the Sundr! \n\nThe god reveals something interesting, talks about Juno, the sun, gives a means to protect the city and help Iver. But when you return to the city, now the king and rugga and the factions have devolved into fighting based on your choices. How are you going to handle this? Which of many possibilities will ascend to the throne? How will you defend the city? And what mystery lies beneath the mountain of the city...\n\nFor Iver's caravan, there should be pockets of dredge villages kept alive by Spellsingers. Now you need to decide to plunder them or not! More stuff to do! Maybe go to the remains of the Varl capital first? Fight warped Valka? Realize deceptions, machinations, corruption, hear stories? Find new characters, have old ones die?\n\nInstead there... wasn't a plot?[/i]",

      "it's a shame but i honestly cannot recommend this game if you are a disabled person, i wasn't that far into the game when my character started panicking apon seeing a disabled person [person with leg braces] and then gets a \"no good answer\" bit of dialog and all the options are saying something wrong or saying nothing, trying to go with the least bad option aside from saying nothing since i know as a disabled person myself [i'm a wheelchair user] it can be pretty upsetting getting people just randomly stare at me and at least when they say something slightly wrong they are engaging with me as a person, my character then proceeds to talk abt what an \"inspiration\" it is 2 c a disabled person living their life,,, not exaggerating when i say i let my head hit the desk, closed the game and uninstalled, i understand that this is probably put in the game to be a teachable moment for the able bodied audience but ironically in trying to educate about us disabled people they then made the assumption that no disabled people would be playing their game as there is no option to make your character disabled or even to make them remotely aware of disability and ended up just making the experience awful for the disabled gamers they seem to be trying to help",

      "Everything apart from the matches is superb, best FM ever. \n\nThe match engine is fundamentally broken - too easy to split a defence open with a long ball resulting in a one-on-one, so SI nerfed the conversion rates of one-on-one chances to keep scorelines acceptable. The result however, is that your world class  striker misses 2-5 easy chances every game. \n\nWingers do not square the ball for strikers, instead preferring to shoot from obscenely acute angles rather than play the ball across the box. \n\nHalf the crowd is a repeated man in an orange jumper. This may sound minor but it's really immersion breaking once you notice it. You can be a team that plays in blue, and yet over 50% of the crowd are dressed in orange. It diminishes the match experience and detracts from the game as a whole.\n\nIt's crap like this, broken for 2 months now, I've bought every game in this series since the year 2000, I pre-order every year (literally the only game I will do so with) and said I'll continue to do so until I get burned.

The 'Bugs' section of your forum is littered with these issues that are \"under review\", well you can consider my purchase of FM 2021 in the same category.\n\nEdit: I played a bunch more because apparently I'm a masochist.

      "A Short Hike is a relaxing, casual game about exploring an expansive, mountainous island park and eventually making your way to its summit so you can get cell phone reception.\n\nYou play as Claire, a bird who can climb, glide, and flap to great heights using a stamina system based upon how many golden and silver feathers you’ve collected. Along the path to the mountaintop you’ll encounter Animal Crossing-style characters who are friendly, punny, and usually have some minor task for you to solve, ranging from finding lost items to making deliveries.\n\nHelping residents of the island is completely optional, as is just about every activity in the game other than locating a few feathers and reaching the summit; as a result, length can range from an hour if you don’t stop to smell the roses to a few hours if you decide to make friends with everyone and see all the park has to offer.\n\nActivities include filling out a fishing journal by trading in your catches, digging in suspicious spots, solving treasure map clues, parkour racing, and opening up shortcuts by breaking blocked entrances and watering bouncy flowers. \n\nA Short Hike has a charming aesthetic and a lovely, peaceful soundtrack.

      "I have it on the Epic store but the amount of stuttering it has made it unplayable so I gave up. I got the Humble choice for $6 to get a steam key and try it on here because I have a few games on steam that run well but run poorly on other platforms like the awful Windows store or the below average Epic launcher, but it's unfortunately the same deal on here for this game. It has done it on two entirely different computer setups for me so that tells me that they didn't bother to spend enough time testing enough different pc setup combinations when it was in development, and my pc setup isn't rare by any means. The look and functioning of the UI and menu's shows that it is a obvious direct console port which would explain their lack of attention to the pc version.\n\nEven giving it a fair shot based on content, it's pretty much just a modified version of Borderlands 2. The amount of dialogue is unbearable. No one in the game EVER shuts up, and every single last word they say is cringe. It's like a kid in fifth grade who laughs at fart jokes wrote the entire script. In addition to everyone never shutting up, the main boss randomly has page-long speeches over the radio just to make sure you get the message that they want you to feel entirely uncomfortable at this game's bottomless amount of cringe.\n\nThe gameplay is identical to BL2, with the only real new noticeable features being that some guns have two functions that you can toggle on and off with the C key and of course the new playable characters. However even without the stuttering ruining the game for me, it's my opinion that BL3's negatives, mainly the insane amount of neverending dialogue and how unbelievably cringe it is, overshadow its positives.",

      "RPGMaker games are renowned for their hit-or-miss quality, with misses far outweighing the hits, at least in the Steam community. That risk said, I love going through the RPGMaker tags and picking out hidden gems. Do I miss a lot and get duds? Sure. But then I find a game like Ara Fell and realize why I enjoy taking my chances. \n\nNow to be fair, most people are playing the Unity version of this game now rather than the original RPGMaker version. While the Unity version is definitely the definitive and better version - I have played both - and it's original RPGMaker version was a very fun experience, too. \n\nThe presentation of this game is top notch. Never before  have a I seen an RPGMaker title that used many of the default assets, and yet made the design of the game their own to the point I had to remind myself of that fact. A lot of these Indie developed RPGMaker games use default assets, and that's fine - it's all about using them in unique and interesting ways, which is where a great many games fail, but not Ara Fell. \n\nSo the game manages to be a visual treat despite itself, but what about the music? Also top notch. Rarely do you play a game of this style and immediately get treated to unique and pleasant music right out of the gate, and it never ceases to be an auditory treat. Usually there is always those one or two tracks that you just don't care for, and it causes you to either mute the sound or to try to get through a section as quickly as possible, but not so in Ara Fell. \n\nGame play is probably the most unique asset this game has to offer. The battles are much more tactical than your traditional turn-based affair because MP is not a finite source - it regens over time. You are encouraged to not simply \"Mash A\" your way to victory. You need to use your skills to the fullest in battle. No really, you have to or this game will beat you to a pulp. While certainly not the most difficult game in the world, and can be cheesed with knowledge, it's no cakewalk either. You have to be smart and a bit strategic to get far in this game.\n\nAnyway, I could gush and gush about this game forever and not get bored. The point is, Ara Fell is an amazing RPGMaker (more so inspired now that it runs on Unity) title that is certainly a diamond among the pile of dirt and rocks. I would go as far to say it is my favorite game of it's caliber, and I have played a great many RPGMaker titles, some also very good. I can think of no higher praise to give this game.",

      "With almost 300 hours of Destiny 2 (D2) back on Battle.net (the Blizzard launcher), let me give this perspective/advice for new players, specifically with regards for the F2P offering that is Destiny 2: New Light, with a few more holistic thoughts sprinkled throughout:\n\nThis overall game is very good. It doesn't always live up to its promise (the first mission of every campaign is always the most polished thing aside from the raids/dungeons), but when it does, it [b]really[/b] shines.\n\nThe gunplay is unrivaled. The visual/audio feedback is great, the handling feels really good, and enemies really pop when you take them out. Expect nothing less from the studio that brought us grunt birthday parties.\n\nThe game is better in a fireteam. Now that the base game is F2P [though with considerably less content than it used to be/I would like], this should be easier than ever for most activities. That said, a huge majority of my playtime was done solo. It can get tricky at times (\"Darkness Zones\" in certain missions prevent respawning but allow for revives, so solo players have a distinct disadvantage there). \n\nWith that said, dungeons (currently 'The Shattered Throne', 'Pit of Heresy', 'Prophecy' which is free to all players, 'Grasp of Avarice', 'Duality', and 'Spire of the Watcher') and raids (\"Last Wish\" from Forsaken, \"Garden of Salvation\" from Shadowkeep, \"The Deep Stone Crypt\" from Beyond Light, 'Vow of the Disciple' from Witch Queen, as well as 'Vault of Glass' and 'King's Fall' from D1 - both of which are both free to all players) are best experienced with a team, so don't shy away from LFG group-finder options like the Discord, official app, or any number of other sites (just make sure to accurately describe your experience, level, and gear. 'Tis only polite). \n\nOf the matchmade multiplayer offerings, I enjoy Gambit (PvPvE, reminds me of the Black Ops Zombies 4z4 mode done right), jump into the occasional Strike (PvE, matchmade fireteams running campaign-like missions), and have no interest in Crucible (PvP, it's fine I guess, but I've never liked PvP that's dependent in large part on personal progression - especially in the competitive modes like Trials of Osiris and Iron Banner)\n\nDon't be afraid to ignore content - this is absolutely the kind of game where you can set your own goals. Want a specific exotic gun? Look up where it drops and focus on grinding that content. Want a specific roll on a random roll gun? Find the best possible farming (or crafting) method and go to town. Chase down some of the exotic questions that the game clutters up your quest page with, or just goof around doing things that you find fun while absolutely ignoring all signposts.\n\nSome stuff just won't be explained in game. It's not as bad as Warframe (much less need for a wiki) but some things are still obscured. Feel free to look up Xur (exotic weapon vendor who visits on weekends) and other hidden exotics tied to specific activities, lost sectors, patrol locations, or quest chains.\n\nFor anything that you can't easily find online - reach out and find a sherpa. The community for this game tends to be pretty great, and enough of us have spent enough time leaning specific parts of it (e.g. raids) or just mechanics in general (\"What are random rolls? Which do I keep?\") that we'd be happy to jump onto discord (there are a bunch for PC, just check out the subreddit sidebar linked below) and answer any and all questions you may have. \n\nThe fact that a representative chunk of this game is free makes this the perfect time to dip your toes in without emptying out your wallet. Any other questions about this game as a product (\"Should I pay for DLC? Is Eververse worth it?\") should absolutely be researched elsewhere.\n\nIf you're looking for a place to start with the F2P content, finish the intro missions in the Cosmodrome. New and returning players are semi-regularly upgraded to a new light level floor, but means that you can miss out on the \"learning the ropes\" parts of the game that come with working your way through the New Light quest chain or unlocking different subclasses. [As of Beyond Light, all of the campaign content through Forsaken are not currently accessible. Release order was Red War (launch campaign) > Forsaken > Shadowkeep > Beyond Light > Witch Queen, followed by the upcoming expansions Lightfall > Final Shape.]\n\nEyes up, guardian.\n\nFootnotes for people yelling at me in the comments:\n-All of this is my opinion. Feel free to hold your own and disagree with mine.\n-I generally enjoy grinding, looter shooters, FPS's, and weird sci-fi space magic. Halo, Borderlands, Warframe, and CoD Zombies are some of my most-played and favorite games.\n-As far as I can tell, anything that is not strictly subjective in the above is factually correct [as of Season of Plunder, with updates noted throughout. This game changes quite a bit over time, so make sure to do your own research before spending money on it]. If I've missed something, feel free to point it out in the comments and I'll do my best to update this periodically. \n-This review previously made mention of both content vaulting and weapon sunsetting. These practices have both been discontinued as of Season of Plunder. However, it is not clear at this if or when power capped or vaulted may return/be uncapped, if ever.\n\n-----------------\nTL:DR: It's good. Not perfect, but really good. And since it's free, you can get a really good sense of if this game is for you without paying for any of it. You can play almost any activity solo pretty easily except for a handful of endgame activities. If you're overwhelmed at first, just play through the Cosmodrome missions while you get your feet under you, or ask a veteran player for help.\n-----------------\n\nSites to use (List was compiled at Shadowkeep launch, but most of it should still be relevant/useful)\n\n    \nBeginner's Guide (Current as of Beyond Light) - https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/49007\n\nThe DTG Subreddit - /r/DestinyTheGame on Reddit - https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/\n\nDestiny Item Manager (mange your inventory from your browser even while in-game, essential to avoid unneeded trips back to the tower) - app.destinyitemmanager.com\n\nDestiny 2 Checklist (Lists out everything to do as well as when it resets in-game) - www.d2checklist.com/\n\nLight gg (Database of in-game items, useful for looking up random rolls) - https://www.light.gg/\n\nBraytech org (Lots of overlapping features, but I really like their maps) - braytech.org/\n\nDatto (Destiny Youtuber / 24:02 Raider who posts lots of useful/educational content, including exotic guides) - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkmAjbIecTIjTQctolYeuDw\n\nIf you've played D2 on another system, check out the CrossSave page (https://www.bungie.net/7/en/crosssave) on the Bungie net official site respectively to get all of your content and progression moved over to Steam.\n\nStory Recap up through Shadowkeep (Spoilers Destiny 1 / D1, and D2, obviously) (My name is Byf on YouTube: The Complete Story of Destiny!

      "The arguably ugly graphics initially turned me off, as I'm sure it will for many of you, but in the end, they turned out to be unique, making an excellent game more memorable. I never had a gaming experience quite like this one, and it really felt as if I had to deduce and think things through. It made me feel more like a detective than most point-and-click mystery adventures. And don't get me wrong, I wouldn't include this game in that category, which I love.\n\nThe plot was amazing, and it was full of clever bits. The game got challenging in a good way without going overboard, and I think the vast majority of deductions was fair, except perhaps one in case 9, which I doubt I would have ever gotten without an in-game hint. The end was a bit anticlimactic after such a build-up, but overall it was a very satisfying journey. I'd definitely be interested in other games using the same concept. If you're unsure, like I was, I suggest trying out the demo where you can play 4 out of the 12 cases.",
      "I knew Journey is a great game,maybe one of the best video games in history,but...\n\nI didn't know why so many people moved by such a simple gameplay.\nI didn't know why people had a Journey-Fever,even players just bought PS3 only for this game.\nI didn't know how close a relationship could be in 100mins only.\nI didn't know how bad i wished to go back to the peak and stay with my friend i'll never meet again.\n\nNow I Know.\n\n“It is better to walk with a friend in the dark than alone in the light” – Helen Keller\n\nIt was an interesting experience for me, I had never played this game nor heard of it until recently. I went and looked at the store page, My Brother/Friend Ethan-Winters Just Told Me this game in the steam store now, so went ahead and bought it. After buying it, went and started up the game some day later. Went into the game, saw another model character that looks like mine, I thought it was an AI because I had thought it was a single player game. So I decided to play along with it, we went through the story, it progressed quite fast, mainly because we both did not really bother to check out other things. The more I played, the more I realized that the guy I was playing with was most definitely not an AI, it was a genuine player. As we went through the story, our cooperation got smoother, we no longer have a solo player attitude, we would signal to each other, wait for each other and walked, fly with each other. It was smoothing, relaxing, a truly unique experience. Even with the setbacks we had throughout our progression, we never gave up, we stuck together from the desert till the end, when one of us screwed up, we patiently waited for the other, chiming to the person where we are. I remember at the end, when i screwed up a jump and did not see the other player, I was genuinely scared, sad, I frantically searched for the person but to no avail. I was distraught, sad and disappointed but I continued onward. When I went up, there he was, chiming for me, assuring me that he had not left yet. I felt happy, comforted when I saw the person waiting for me and together we finished the story. I am not one to do reviews, but it was such a unique experience among my years of gaming that I had to share it. Thank you, punks for the experience, truly thank you. And thank you, for bothering to read my review.\n\ni'll never forget our journey kind stranger.\n\nThis wasn't a game, it was an experience. I highly recommend you do this.",

      "This game is set to release in early October, but I definitely wouldn't buy it anytime soon. It's not ready.

      "Ok so... \n\nFar From Noise is a narrative game in which you play a woman stuck in its car, balancing on the edge of a cliff. \n\nIt's about life, death, nature, purpose, creativity, dreams, stars and badgers. \n\nThe thing about Far From Noise is that it'll ask you something very special, something that we all forget to do nowadays, something that I've forgotten. This game will ask you to take your time. Don't rush things. Sit down and relax as you'll be forced to follow the slow pace of the game, but you'll enjoy it, for sure.\n\nThis game is for you if you come home after a rough day at work. This game is for you if you're searching for a meaning, a purpose in your life. This game is for you if you just want to experiment something new.\n\nBecause Far From Noise is offering you something new. It gives a vibe that is between Firewatch and Life is Strange, but without all the forced action, stress, adrenaline those game wanted to give. Don't misunderstand me, I loved those 2 games, but Far From Noise chose a direction more... pure. It's just you and the nature that evolves around you.\n\nI've finished the game within 90 mins, but I heard they were several endings, so I might as well try to get some more (but the one I've got fully satisfied me, to be honest).\n\nBeing more pragmatic, the art and sound coincide perfectly. The visuals are gorgeous and the musics hit just right where it needs to. You'll be lifted by the compositions as you'll stare into the beautiful sunset, and the dark starry sky.\n\nYou may find it expensive, as the game costs 8$ for one hour and a half of experience, but hey, think about a cinema ticket. Far From Noise is cheaper and the experience you'll live in it is wayyyyy more unique than most of the movies you go see. \n\nI recommend it. Play it. It'll put your mind at ease.\n\n\n\nPS: the main character is one of the most well-written i've seen in video games.",
      "I am a day one player who quit the game within a few days. After coming back after almost 2 years, I am shocked and surprised. The overall improvement is great, quests are not bothering you. Story and atmosphere is hooking you up and the overall experience is good. Leveling up is easy and also you are not struggling as in most MMOs.\n\nDespite the past of the game, I think it is worth trying.",
      "Wanna spend 20% of the time scared, 60% of the time confused, 15% of the time infuriated, and 5% of the time laughing your ass off? THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU!\n\nFor the rest, save your money.\n\nIt's so buggy, dark, poorly optimized, and confusing; you'll spend more time pulling your hair out than the rare moments that it actually manages to pull off a jumpscare. Also, it is NOT procedurally generated at all. Watched a YouTuber play this game and got the exact same map and jumpscares... er... \"jumpscares\" as they did. Not worth $10. If they can fix the bugs and tweak a few things, though, it'd at least be worth 5.\n",
      "This game is amazing! Truly the Dark Souls of little girl simulators.\n\nI’m glad that Dark Souls taught me how to dodge in literally every video game, it unknowingly prepared me for this. Ender Lilies is a Soulslike with JoJo Stand combat. That’s an instant win for me.\n\nThe world is depressing, suffocating and overwhelmingly beautiful. Each stories of the main spirits are well written and realistically human. The endings are top notch too.\n\nIf you’re even considering playing it… play it… I promise you won’t regret it. I was much more emotionally invested in this game than I was on Hollow Knight. Lilly is an amazing protagonist… and she never even utters a word. She doesn’t have to.\n\nIt's a beautiful game with fun combat, awesome art and amazing music. My only real complaint was a bit of exploration fatigue having to go around finding all the collectibles. \n\nI think the easiest way to sum up Ender Lilies is \"It's Momodora, but better.\" It has the same gameplay loop of \"slash slash roll behind the enemy slash slash repeat\" and fairly challenging bosses, in a much bigger and more non-linear world with nearly every single room having some sort of collectible. It's also aesthetically atmospheric and pleasing, and the soundtrack is great.\n\nI can safely say that this game is a creative masterpiece. And in the end… Like Lilly, don’t we all have a little girl inside of us, telling us to stop all this silliness and go back to being the proper good boys our Mother wanted us to be?\n\n10/10",
      "As a historical novelist and former high school English teacher with over 700 books in my home devoted to ancient Greek literature, history and culture I had to try this game.\n\nI should mention that I am pushing 60 years old and although I like strategy games like Creative Assembly’s Rome II, I’m not a fan of ‘gopher’ games that make you run around collecting items, rescuing damsels in distress, delivering messages, and murdering politicians to level your character.  The whole premises seems rather tedious and unimaginative.  \n\nSo right from the start I expected to hate Assassin’s Creed Odyssey.  Combine that with the fact that I’d never played an Assassin’s Creed game before, and I am not the most nimble finger clicker, I was prepared to spend a good portion of my playing time getting my head lopped off.  \n\nNone of that happened.  Well, yeah, there is a pretty steep learning curve here.  I did spend a lot of my initial hours zigging when I should have been zagging, and with my opponent’s spear in my head, but I stuck with it and eventually even an old poop like me was able to figure out the mechanics.\n\nWhat kept me going was the sheer majesty of the game and the beauty of the surroundings.  \n\nI’ve been to Athens, Sparta, Argos, Mycenae, Delos, Aegina, Hydra, Crete, Melos (now Santorini), and dozens of other locales on the campaign map multiple times.  I’ve walked around the ruins at Delphi, strolled the docks of Piraeus and walked through valley of Laconia for research for my books.  I wanted to see these places at they might have looked 2,500 years ago and that for me is the true joy of Assassin’s Creed Odyssey.\n\nThe team at Ubisoft deserves a lot of credit.  They did their homework.  Sure, you’d expect to see historical figures like Pericles, Socrates, Alcibiades and Archidamas in a game about the Peloponnesian War.  But that anyone outside of academia even knows who Brasidas, Aspasia, Herodotus and Pausanias were, is impressive.  Kudos to you.\n\nI’m probably an oddball gamer because I was not motivated by stabbing people in the back to gain levels and steal loot.  The entire idea of stabbing people in the back goes against the grain of the Greek ethos of ‘kleos’ or honor.  What kept me going was the desire to see more of the world that Ubisoft created.  \n\nI wanted to visit the Athenian Acropolis and see the Propylaea, Erechtheion and Parthenon as they were shiny and new, instead of in piles of rubble.  I wanted to gaze up at Phidias' statue of Zeus in Olympus (one of the wonders of the ancient Greek world that no longer exists), speak to the Pythia at the temple of Delphi, and see the five villages of Sparta as they might have looked.  Getting to walk the streets of Athens, Argos and Elis was like taking a trip back in time.  Magical.\n\nOkay, the game isn’t perfect.  The pronunciation of common names like Pericles and Socrates and the character’s accents were maddening.  I can only guess that Ubisoft believes we’ve Americanized the real pronunciations, or at least I hope that’s what they were thinking.  Ultimately it’s a minor annoyance.\n\nThe hoplite battles were a major disappointment.  The Greeks fought in a phalanx formation.  Shoulder to shoulder.  Shield to shield.  The battles here are a 300 movie style free for all.  Oh well, guess you can’t have everything.  \n\nAlso I could not fathom how Alexios and Kassandra could be descended from Leonidas, but have no connection to the Agiad royal family.  By rights they should have been Pausanias’ cousins, but they’re not.  I don’t know who they are. The whole Pythagoras-is-my-father thing is rather bizarre and makes no sense at all.  \n\nI won’t go off the charts here listing the historical inaccuracies that drove me batsh!t crazy, as it serves no purpose.  Suffice it to say that I enjoyed the game.  \n\nIf you ever wanted to unravel the labyrinth of the minotaur beneath King Minos palace at Knossos, get drunk and sing songs with Socrates at an Athenian symposium, feel the Aegean Sea roll beneath your feet on the deck of a  trireme, or stare out in wonder at the lights twinkling over Attica at twilight, try this game.  You won’t be disappointed.",

      "Was a bit turn off when I saw it was a stationary shooter, but the game is so fun I look past that and even began to enjoy the room scaling dodging mechanics (game can make you work up a sweat!).\n\nA must for anyone looking for a more intense arcade shooting experience. I cannot overstate how fun it is to build your weapons in VR, the crafting system works flawlessly and seemely without the need of menus or UIs getting in the way, props for the devs for how well the game integrates with VR controls.\n\nWhat I liked:\n- Varied enemies\n - Great VR controls\n- Gun crafting is addicting and allows for a lot of experimentation\n- Great Bosses\n\nWhat I had trouble with:\n- Makes you wish you could run around the rooms like the original game!\n- The reduced FOV of most VR headsets makes it quite difficult to keep track of enemies that come from multiple directions. Some rooms require so much head movement that I tend to get sick.\n- When a room spawns with multiple shield pylons and a healer bot, it gets extremely frustrating if you have slow moving projectile weapons.\n\nWishes:\n- More gun parts!

      "When I first played Battlefield 1 it literally sent me to the hospital, cause you’re supposed to seek immediate medical attention if your erection lasts longer than 4 hours.\n\nThis is easily one of the most badass games  in history. The music, the landscape, the gunplay, the hit register and the satisfying kill effect, EVERYTHING is just amazing. The last true Battlefield game. I enjoyed every second of this amazing game.  \n\nBF1 isn’t fully historically accurate but it is historically immersive. The war stories in this game genuinely made me emotional sometimes and I’m not ashamed to admit that. \n\nAs someone who is more on the “historical accuracy” side of games, I can say without a doubt that Battlefield 1 did an incredible job. Hell, they were even able to be diverse without pandering to anybody! The 1st Russian Women’s Battalion of Death, the Harlem Hellfighters, people from French-occupied northwestern Africa, the list goes on. What sets this game’s inclusivity of a variety of people and groups from other games is that it does so when it has a reason to and is still accurate to the time and setting. \n\nThat’s one of the main reasons why Battlefield 5 pissed me off so much. Instead of a British woman with a prosthetic arm wielding a cricket bat in WW2, why not include Lyudmila Pavlichenko, aka Lady Death, a female Russian sniper who had 309 confirmed kills? What about the French women who fought? They were in extremely small numbers, but they were a thing. Historically accurate inclusion is fucking awesome, and I love when games do it. But inclusivity for its own sake is terrible and it cheapens said character’s presence in the game’s setting. \n\nEven the DLC are fantastic. I remember how amazing I felt when the “for the Tsar” DLC came out and I first played it. I have never seen people fight so hard to the death in a video game without a whole lot of rage. It was amazing. I felt like I was part of the Russian revolution. Please do yourself a favor and buy this game.\n\n9/10\n\nOnly gave it a 9 ‘cause the 1 is already there…",
      "I reviewed the original Mark of the Ninja more than 4 years ago. I liked its stealth-based gameplay approach and praised the learning curve experienced throughout the story. I bought the [i]Special Edition[/i] which practically meant an add-on with some more levels, a custom and the option to replay the entire game in commentary mode. \n\nYou know some games get re-released due to the availability of a new console generation. This [i]Remastered[/i] edition is what was made available for PS4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch users not long ago.

I do not have a 4K display so this higher resolution I cannot enjoy. Compressed in-game art or not the original already looked very good. But the creators confirmed this will give us an enhanced experience even under 1080p resolution. \n\nWell, I did complete the game once again as this is how much I love MoN. I recommend that you do the same.\n\nPS: It may be possible that you are required to have the special edition of the original version to get the remastered version.",
      "Mori's 3-Part Review:\n1. Bare minimum information and recommendations to improve your playthrough\n2. Background information on me and my playthrough\n3. More extensive non-spoiler reactions\n \nPart 1: Recommendations for You\nIf you're like me and you try to get all the extra scene dialogue, then please, if you take nothing else from this, give yourself time to play this game yourself. There is actually so much content here, I really want you all to take your time to experience it as you go. The game is just too long to binge in a reasonably short amount of time, and if you do binge, you're going to lose a lot.\n \nMy recommendations:\n1. Give yourself time to play the game. Let it sink in, and take notes- it'll be rewarded. The game is literally too dense and too long to binge reasonably if you like 100%ing.\n \n2. Get invested in the characters and pay attention to them, not just the (admittedly stellar) mysteries.\n \n3. Explore the game, its mechanics, and its dialogue yourself. Don't be afraid to restart a Somnium several times; the more options you pick, the more meaningful information you get.\n \n4. If you're a puzzle lover then try to solve the game yourself. You're going to have a blast if you manage it, and the game has tons of built-in hint systems to make it even easier, fairer, and more fun.\n \n5. Try to go in knowing at little as you can. The marketing has already done a great job. Focus on finishing the game and bringing it all together.\n \n6. On PC, force anti-aliasing on using your graphics card to make the game prettier. Game ran and controlled smoothly with few bugs.\n \n7. You don't need AI1 to play AI2, but I think AI2 does spoil AI1, though you could still enjoy them in reverse order.\n \n7. If you're sensitive to horny then just read less background dialogue in Ryuki side. Gore is pretty toned down, and there isn't any single huge CW.\n \nYou can stop reading now if you don't want your playthrough tainted by my reactions/expectations effected.\n \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nPart 2: Who am I, and how do I play?\nI'm an Uchikoshi fanatic. I've played all his English-translated games, and visual novels are my favorite genre of game. I've played a lot of visuals novels, but Uchizawa's are my favorites. I usually try to 100% complete all the scenes and see all the bonus dialogue. I've also played a lot of other genres of game, and I do like fun gameplay, but the most important things to me tend to be:\n \nA. An interesting story is absolutely what gets me invested\nB. Bunches of novel ideas like unique plot points I haven't seen before, philosophical ideas, or puzzles\nC. Characters that I at least don't actively hate; I can like a game for the above two, but characters still matter\nD. Deep personal connection, usually formed by connections to real people or how a game shaped my life\n \nThose are the ways I rate my top games. For the last 8 years, my top 2 favorite games have been the same:\n \nMy top favorite game of all time is Remember11. I love the plot, the ideas, the twists, the characters, and it's what got me truly invested in Uchikoshi. It's very much a mystery game first with an unravelling mystery and themes I love to explore.\n \nMy second favorite game is Virtue's Last Reward. I love the interactive moral dilemmas. VLR's use of the Prisoner's Dilemma jumpstarted my interested in Philosophy which led me to major in Philosophy. I don't like the characters as much save for a few, but it's still very important to me.\n \nNow, let me tell you how I've played AINI: I've basically been playing non-stop since June 13th.\n \nTake this with a grain of salt because I've been documenting as I play (the average main story playtime seems to be 20-35 hours, with 100% likely taking 50+), but right now, I have 97 hours of playtime. I have not gotten all the dialogue, achievements, or fully explored the abundance of extra mechanics. Instead, I have a 616-page reaction document full of constant laughs, cries, screams, passing out, and most of all love.\n \nPart 3: My Review\nThe R11 #1 and VLR #2 holy duology held true for 8 years. Also, AI1 isn't one of my favorite standalone games; it has huge personal connection for me because of the community and the AI1 ARG, but it wasn't my favorite as a game.\n \nI gave all that background because I want you to take me seriously when I say this:\nAI2 is my new favorite game. The #1 spot has been Easily dethroned.\n \nThe themes, twists, characters, ideas, gameplay, visuals, voice acting, fair mystery, presentation, mechanics, and comedy all of it resonates together perfectly. I don't even tend to value gameplay or visuals, but at many times, this game is fun to play while looking genuinely beautiful and cinematic.\n \nThe story reads like a proper Uchikoshi + Nakazawa return to form. The mystery is fair, interesting, meaningful, and complex told satisfyingly. There are many deep ideas, concepts, and themes utilized in thought-provoking ways.\n \nGameplay-wise, there are tons of mechanics that are utilized to make each Somnium unique; they all feel designed by love, fair, and reflective of the character through gorgeous symbolism. They blow the first game completely out of the water. Each one is its own experience to explore and a visual delight. There are also tons of mechanics for you to discover that make AI2 a fun game to play.\n \nThe animations, voices, and directing are cinematic; this game is actually breathtaking a lot of the time. It's backed up by great and charming character writing- despite the fact Mizuki is my favorite AI1 character with 0 contest, I grew to like much of the AI2 cast the same amount.\n \nAI2 is a story about halves and splitting, but also love and coming together- please, see it through until it's whole. I hope and believe you will all fall in love with AI2 like me; AI2 is all I've ever wanted. AI2 is my dream game come true; it's a gorgeous love letter to all Uchikoshi fans who love Zero Escape's puzzles, Infinity's mysteries, and AI's characters and humor.",

      "Please, bare with me here...I NEVER write reviews for anything (this is probably the third review I have ever written), but I feel like I need to write this one for so many reasons!!!  I grew up playing the Telltale/Lucas Arts Series: Monkey Island. After discovering and playing those, I figured out that I have an infinite amount of love for Point and Click adventure games. After finishing that series, I really only played the other games made by either Lucas Arts or Telltale (Mostly because I thought they were the only creators of Point and Click games...until about a year ago, when I discovered there's an entire genre/world of Point and Click).  Of course, I must also note: The Curse of Monkey Island will always be my fav, as it was the first Point and Click I ever played. Ok...NOW...with all of that being said, I recently discovered WADJET EYE GAMES and I am SO happy I did. I would recommend EVERY.SINGLE,GAME they sell. I have played all of their MAC/iOS compatible Point and Clicks, and I have yet to be (even slightly) disappointed. I had very high expectations going in as the Monkey Island games, Day of the Tentacle, Full Throttle, Grim Fandago, etc. are some of the best games in the history of Point and Click; however, all of the games I have played from Wadjet Eye have been amazing. They have actually been so amazing that I can 100% say Wadjet Eye is at the top of my list, right there with the Telltale/Lucas Arts games. I 100% recommend purchasing and playing every game made by Wadjet Eye to anyone who likes (even those who kinda sorta like) Point and Click games.",
      "[h1][b]★★★★☆[/b][/h1]\nSuper Time Force Ultra (STFU...) hits all the stereotypical tropes of an indie game. Fourth wall breaking humor, bright pastel colors, a synth soundtrack and of course retro graphics. Granted, this game came out in 2014, but today, frequent gamers might be sick of this. Despite that, the game certainly is still worth checking out. Behind the bad, immature humor lies a very apparant, unique and interesting game mechanic: the ability to rewind time and to run next to your former self.\n\nThe humor really turned me off the first time I booted this game up. It's too much in your face and it tries really hard to be funny. On top of that, it also tends to be really profane. There is a character that you can control that literally is a turd that has an ability to fart. One of the levels takes place within a sewer where you have to fight poop and ride it down pipes. Humor like this makes it feel like you're playing a game made by a 13 year old.\n\nThe gameplay, on ther other hand, is suprisingly refreshing and fun. Not only can you rewind time, you will also see your former selves run next to you and do the same damage as before. The whole game is build around this 'cloning' mechanic, as levels have to be finished within a certain time limit that can only be beaten with cooperation with yourself. For example, it can take forever to take a boss out by yourself, but by rewinding (to any moment you like) you can use more firepower to kill the boss faster. As you can imagine, this can create scenes where you fight of enemies along [i]many[/i] other characters you have controlled. It's the good kind of chaotic, as it never feels random to what happens in the game. My only real problem with it are the controls that don't always seem to registrate well. For instance, when you run of a slope, your character tend to be in the air just a couple of pixels high, which means it cannot jump. I ran off so many platforms because of this, but it is not a severe problem.\n\nThe game is not particulairy hard. You can rewind lots of times and by doing so, the level gets easier and easier. The dev also included a kind of trial mode, aside from the diverse story levels. Some of these levels are a little annoying, but ultimately I had fun with it in short sessions. The achievements are also not hard to unlock. It mostly involves collecting orbs and characters.\n\nFor the standard 13 bucks, this is not a bad deal! That is, if you go for all the achievements. When it is on sale, I would say this is a safe buy.",

      "This is a review about the port, not the game. The game itself is fantastic. I reference Moguri Mod throughout the review - this is a fan made mod that aims to improve the visual quality of the port.\n\nThe port is a lazy outdated mess:\n- It's lacking visual FX present in the original, such as the mist in the overworld of the Mist Continent. [b]This was fixed in a patch.[/b]\n- There is no way to restore the original font. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- Dialogue is rendered at a static pace, unlike the original. In the original game, lines of dialogue would show up on screen depending on how fast the character was talking. In this port, there is no distinction. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- There are multiple problems with the battle UI:\n-- It takes 40% of the screen. Square Enix patched this in the console versions, but the PC version was never patched. [b]This patch was released on PC in an update on the 6th of August 2020.[/b]\n-- It's rendered at what feels like 15fps, making navigation feel extremely clunky. In the original game, all menus were rendered at either 30fps interpolated or 60fps (don't know which one exactly), which made the browsing very fluid. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- All menus are clunky to browse because of the crippling low framerate. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- It's missing sound effects from the original. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- Despite porting the game to Unity, Square couldn't be bothered to re-write the animation code to speed up battle animations independently of buff/debuff tick timers, arguably the original game's biggest problem. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- The music in this port is a lower sample version of the original. [u]This is fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- The backgrounds clash horribly with the new character models. [u]This is fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n\nThe ONLY positive of this version is that you can skip the introduction to every battle. Except not really, because the option doesn't work half the time.\n\nThanks to the Moguri Mod, it is arguable that this version comes close to the original. Regardless of my opinion though, I'm not about to praise Square Enix for a port that the fans patched up. Moguri Mod is the only reason to buy this game on Steam.",

      "First off, just want to say this isn't a Metroidvania. This is a Zelda clone. And a good one!\n\nI bought this game because I heard it really put stress on you. You have limited time to complete the game and NPCs will begin dying if you aren't fast enough. Pretty crazy, right? Well, I do have a few gripes with that, but let me point out the good stuff first:\n+ Amazing combat. You have access to both guns and swords, but most of your damage will likely come from melee weapons since they have the ability to do an extremely-easy-to-pull-off PARRY! Parrying an enemy stuns it and gives your next attack against it a massive damage multiplier. All enemies, all bosses, and most projectiles are parryable, so this is what combat ends up revolving around. Even though I call it easy, you still get that cool feeling when you walk into an ambush and clear it without taking a hit, so it never gets dull as you go through the game.\n\n+ Good dungeon design. Since this game takes after Zelda, it's not shy about inserting a few puzzles into its dungeons. The overworld as well has quite a few surprising secrets and side quests that you won't be expecting when you play for the first time.\n\n+ Sequence breaks. This is mostly for New Game+ (or New Game Extra, a separate mode where you have access to major exploration items from the start, but not your whole endgame inventory), but it was interesting to find out how many secret paths and shortcuts there were, and how tightly they were managed. The devs thought of everything!\n\nSo now for the bad stuff.\n- Underwhelming story. Guess how much is really explained over the course of this story. If you guessed \"all of it\", you would be completely wrong and here's your dunce hat. Unsighted ends up spending so much of its time on the protagonist's relationships that it fails to answer several of the more important questions concerning the game's backstory. Why was there was a war? Who started it? Where are the humans now? Why are they so disorganized? Why do they seem to have no chain of command whatsoever? How did the automatons ever win anything at all at any point when they seem so extremely outclassed? I guess it doesn't matter. Look, there's two robot-girls kissing.\n\n- Fake pressure. I heard there was going to be pressure before I started the game, so I decided to go DEFCON 1 from the get-go and rush everything. I ended up completing the game in 10 in-game days and I felt pretty good about it. Zero NPC deaths! Zero! I'm a super awesome amazing hero, right? Well, credits roll and... the only achievement I get is the one for beating the game. No one really cares and apparently you're meant to play through multiple times anyway. So... why did I ever care? Why is this mechanic even in the game? All it did was make me shy away from general exploration and side quests since all of those things are less important than, ya know, saving the world. You can call that interesting, but when it has no payoff, it ends up being frustrating.\n\n- No post-game. Did I mention, if you bumrush the game and finish with just hours left on everyone's timers, you don't get to do any extra no-timer exploring afterwards? No, the game's over. Load the save and you get set back to where you were before fighting the final boss. If you want to do any actual exploring, that's what \"Explorer\" mode is for. You know, that mode that makes you feel like you're cheating?\n\nBasically, Unsighted is another game filled with missed opportunities. I recommend this game because the core gameplay and level design is very well done and very well executed, but you should probably know this before you start:\n\nThe only pressure here is the one you imagine. Since the game does nothing to acknowledge your successes, just play it at your own pace and don't be shy about using Explorer. Shame on the devs for hailing the agony of defeat, but not the thrill of victory.",

And that doesn't really make me feel like I'm a part of a story, as much as a I feel like I'm going through an eternally looping monday, getting increasingly distanced to the world around me as I finally end up throwing myself overboard, because 'why not?'.\n\nI won't refund it, because I think the devs have poured a lot of heart into this game and I do think they deserve the money, but I couldn't really find too much entertainment in the game.",
      "*puts on hipster cap* Well I have played this before, and let me tell you it is quite the experience.\n\nYume Nikki is a bare-bones surreal game created with RPGMaker. You play as a young girl (Madotsuki, according to the fandom) who refuses to step outside of her bedroom. Besides the dreadfully boring video games in her room, all she can do to entertain herself is to sleep, entering into her dream world. The \"goal\" of the game is to explore her dreams, collecting the various effects and bringing them back to the main nexus.\n\nLittle is known about the creator, and even less is known about the game's story. Yume Nikki lives very much by the philosophy of \"Show, Don't Tell\". There is no dialogue, music is limited to short sound bytes on loop, and the graphics look like something out of the 16-bit era. Despite all of this, Yume Nikki still managed to gather an almost cult-like following; the amount of fan work and theories created for Yume Nikki is truly astounding.\n\nPlenty of games try to capture the beauty and wonder of our dreams, but the reality is they can also be ugly and painful experiences, dredging up our deepest subconscious fears and desires. Yume Nikki refuses to shy away from the dark and the strange, understanding that this what gives our dreams meaning. Like any abstract art piece, it is impossible to place a singular meaning on anything in Yume Nikki. Everyone will interpret and relate to its events differently, and perhaps this is the crux of what let Yume Nikki gather its cult following.\n\nIts greatest strength is also its greatest weakness. The complete lack of direction is not exactly user friendly. This game does not hold your hand. There is no map, so the only way to figure out where to go is to get hopelessly lost many times as you explore the strange worlds behind each nexus door. It will be tempting to simply look up a guide, and I must admit I was guilty of watching a play-through myself for some parts. Indeed, completing the game without looking anything up is an achievement in itself.  However, the game was meant to be played, not watched. The joy (and sometimes terror) of discovery makes the experience worth experiencing. After you've given the game a proper playing, THEN you should look up all the stuff you inevitably missed. Cough cough [spoiler]Uboa[/spoiler] cough cough.\n\nWith that in mind, I humbly offer some advice to make your experience a bit more palatable. Feel free to ignore this if you wish to remain completely spoiler-free.\n\n1) Know the controls! They are not explained very well in the game.\n\nArrow keys: Movement\nZ: Accept; interact with objects (also Enter, Spacebar)\nX: Cancel; open the game menu (also C, V, B, N, Insert)\n1: Use an effect’s ability\n3: Cancel an effect’s ability\n5: Drop an effect on the ground (only in the Nexus)\n9: Pinch yourself to wake up and return to the real world. This one is especially important to remember, as sometimes you may find yourself in a dead-end zone leaving this as your only means of escape.\n\n2) Each time you wake up, make sure to use the desk In the real world to save your progress.\n\n3) Be thorough. Many of the dream worlds are expansive, with few landmarks. However, many of them also warp at each end, meaning if you walk in a straight line you will eventually return to where you started. You can use this to your advantage while mapping out the more expansive zones. Take note of interesting landmarks that you can use for future exploration. It might be helpful to keep some scratch paper handy if you have a bad memory like me.\n\n4) Interact with everything. If you see anything that looks strange or out of place, give it a poke. There are few enemies in the game, and nothing can actually kill you. Sometimes that creepy object might be the ticket to transport you into a new area. Also, try using different effects in different situations. You may find they have useful properties.\n\n5) Search for the bicycle effect first, it will make exploration much easier as it greatly increases your movement speed. You can find the bike effect in [spoiler]the zone behind the right door at the bottom-most side of the nexus[/spoiler]. I will leave locating it to you.\n\n\nWell, what are you waiting for? Give this game a try, you have nothing to lose! Except, maybe your sanity. Eh, you didn't really need that anyway.",

      "\nWell, after almost a year of not playing this game, I must say, the devs did fix most of my issues. *Most*. Creative mode is fun, but you still need to collect stuff to make things, which is incredibly tedious. On top of that, the character dialogue is still really annoying and you need a NASA computer to play at a stable framerate, but hey, you can actually play without getting your ass beat. I'd like to up my ranking to an 8/10. Very fun, but I highly recommend playing with others. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOG REVIEW (outdated):\nThis game has potential, but unfortunately having fun with it is impossible if you aren't a hardcore survivalist.\n\nCritical Issue #1:\nThe main characters won't stop talking. Everytime you eat or hold the torch they say an unfunny one-liner that makes me want to gouge my eyes out with forks. Even Robin Ayou from Subnautica: Below Zero talked less, and the original game had a silent protaganist. Having characters that have constant dialogue that always repeats is just so annoying to the point where I had to turn off the volume. If the main characters were silent but atleast talked with each other, then I could see potential in that. But they just talk and talk and talk and none of it means anything.\n\nCritical Issue #2:\nThe enemies are way too hard to battle. To make better gear, you need to take on enemies that are so difficult to battle. Maybe you could say I'm just not good at battling enemies in survival games, but I was able to easily battle monsters in Terraria, Minecraft, Subnautica and Raft just fine. When your in-game monsters are too hard to defeat without gear that requires you to battle even MORE monsters, it is not fun, repetitive, and frustrating.\n\nCritical Issue #3:\nThe story is in the background. The fact that the story doesn't impact the game as much as it should is probably the worst aspect of any piece of media out there. The game sends you an a goose chase to find the  main story and it is infuriating. The story itself is all over the place. First it just seems like you need to make yourself grow bigger, but then it goes completely off the rails and into this scientist bunker with a robot that gives you quests, but you can ignore him and continue playing. I don't know if they finished the story, but so far it is not good.\n\nSomewhat Critical Issue:\nThere is no setting to dial back the graphics without lowering the resolution to look like Terraria. I can't see, and it is dumb and brings the whole beautiful vibe of being small down, ironically.\n\nMinor Issues:\nThe music is bland, and although I love electronic/synth music, this is just not it. The fact that you can't have bugs as pets or mounts, or even herd them is extremely upsetting. The farming sucks ass, it gives you 4 items of what you grew every 2 in-game days, when you can just find that item in more abundance at the place where it is located. Under the pond... JESUS CHRIST, the graphics are so bad. The wavy filter looks so bad, and you can see the entire underwater area crystal f**king clear, even though other smaller bodies of water have some kind of murkiness to it. Minor issues like this hold back the game.\n\nAlthough this is still in early access, it feels as if they wasted a lot of potential already. For such a unique world and concept, it never really exploits the amazing and obvious things that it can accomplish. Why not grow your own personal army of ants? Oh sorry, you can pick up eggs but they hatch and they aren't friendly. Why not create a raft made of weed stems and lilypads? Oh sorry, you can just build a base that looks like a boat. Although there are much worse steam games out there, and ones that I have hated more than this, this was sort of a slap to the face. It's not god-awful, and there are a lot of good things about it like the cartoony bug designs and the beautiful graphics, but honestly, it's a 6/10 bordering on a 7, and although many others have enjoyed this, being the super critical demogorgon that I am, this didn't exactly \"ground\" me.",
      "I came across Dreamscaper after playing 200 hours of Hades. I was looking for similar games that could recapture some of the magic of discovery and progression that made Hades such a delightful experience.\n\nDreamscaper is not Hades. There probably isn't any game that can measure up to the experience of playing Hades, and there probably won't be for a long while. But a lot of the same elements are there, and I did really enjoy Dreamscaper for what it was.\n\nThe \"story\" in Dreamscaper is more of a personal journey. There aren't really \"events occurring\" so much as a character working through her issues. The supporting characters are fairly interesting, though not quite on par with the literally larger-than-life dynamic personalities of Hades. But to be fair, the characters in Dreamscaper are ordinary folks, not mythological deities.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the game is \"nostalgic.\" It's an exploration of the protagonist's childhood memories, so that makes sense. There is a very different energy here than Hades' cheeky and horny angst. It's more sad and calm.\n\nIn terms of the feel of playing the game, Dreamscaper has a lot of similarities to Hades. There is a varied arsenal of different weapons and abilities, progression through randomized levels with boss fights, a wide selection of permanent character upgrades to purchase using resources gathered during runs, a relationship system to grow closer with the characters, etc. Unlike Hades, every aspect of your loadout can change throughout a run: you can swap out weapons and abilities as you encounter new and better ones along the way. It's both more flexible than Hades and less; you're not locked in to one weapon for the entire run, and there are many more weapons and abilities (and combinations thereof); but with more randomness comes less control, so it's a lot harder to craft and hone a particular build in Dreamscaper than in Hades. A lot of the \"builds\" are elemental damage modifiers, in which all you're trying to do is find a bunch of gear that (say) deals Lightning damage or increases your Lightning damage dealt. The upgrades are largely \"number get bigger,\" and while it can be satisfying to get a bunch of cool multipliers, it does feel less \"combo\"y or \"breakable\" than Hades (though there are certainly some very powerful and broken-feeling builds you can end up with).\n\nThe gameplay is challenging, like Hades, though perhaps slightly less. Like Hades, a lot of your ability to clear rooms and defeat bosses effectively comes from learning their attack patterns and timings. I do wish there were more variety to the enemies, as many of them are just \"the guy from the last level but he is stronger and has more abilities now\" (though that criticism applies to Hades as well). The boss fights are by and large much easier once you learn their patterns, though there are still a few that can be tough for certain builds. The \"hard version\" of bosses are definitely a force to be reckoned with, though.\n\nThe art and music are attractive and inviting. It's much more The Sims than Guilty Gear, but in a way that fits the atmosphere nicely. It's stylized in a very different way than Hades, but it works in its own way.\n\nThe developers are also very community-oriented and are responsive to community input through their Discord. The Hades developers probably are too, but I have no direct experience interacting with them.\n\nSo in conclusion, if you liked Hades because of its horny angst, badass metal riffs, mythological themes, and bloody humor, you may not have much interest in Dreamscaper. But if you liked Hades because of its randomized runs, variety of weapons and builds, feeling of progression, challenging boss fights, and dynamic cast of characters with complicated relationships, then you should absolutely pick up Dreamscaper. And if you didn't like Hades, then you probably stopped reading this review after the first paragraph.",

As it is, the game is entertaining for a couple hours, then quickly grows tiresome and frustrating. The bugs are not crippling, but taken as a whole they represent a game that is very unbalanced and grates on you over time. \n\nIf DF-9 ever hits the $5 pile, pick it up. otherwise pass.",
      "[h1] Overview [/h1]\nThis is going to be a really long review, so I'm just going to start off with an overview of the whole game. For, one I really enjoyed playing it because of its unique playstyle and interesting storyline. This game kept me engaged the whole time and even though I finished the main storyline, I feel like there is sitll more for me to do. And one last thing, I won't be reviewing Multiplayer here, since I haven't played multiplayer yet.\n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\nThe storyline is definitely a strong point of this game. Rather than giving you evrything from the start, you get thrown into an unknown world with little known about the end of the game and the path that leads to it. You find out more progressively as you search and discover ruins to find ancient relics that give more clues about the past. However, you don't have to explore each area to its fullest potential the first time you enter the game, you can also come back to areas with fast travel (except for at the very end towards the conclusion of the game). The tombs you can raid are also kind of like side quests and the relics that you can find, both inside the tombs and around the map give you insight into the area and the main story. There are also several cut scenes that add onto the story and I thought the experience was a lot more directed than a game such as Skyrim, but it still provides a large amount of freedom.\n\n[h1]Level Design/Graphics [/h1]\nSpeaking of freedom and your ability to enjoy the world around you, I feel like this feeds perfectly into another aspect of the game. One of the most important parts of the modern game is the graphics engine with which it runs, as well as how it is exploited to provide the best experience. Though this Tomb Raider is undoubtedly older than what one would consider modern, I still find that it does a good job with shaders and keeping the world immersive. And though the textures, normals maps, and hair physics may not be the best I have ever seen, they are still very good. The cinematic cutscenes feel actually cinematic and everything seems to be smoothed out with animations which makes the experience itself a lot more enjoyable. I also really enjoyed how this game had well worked out levels, beautiful scenery, and a in fact a partially open world experience. Though some levels will collapse, break, and change once you go through them, other parts of the island are simply very enjoyable slow-paced worlds than can be explored once the game is over, which brings to my next point.\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\nLast, but not least I want to talk about gameplay (please keep in mind this review is directed at those interested in Tomb Raider for the single player experience). The gameplay was fluid and interseting. You have the parkour notion which is one of the biggest parts of the Tomb Raider series. This part doesn't seem to be too difficult in this game, but it certainly isn't easy either. Another portion is the shooter portion where a bunch of guys try to murder you and you protect yourself (because you don't want to die). However, the main part about this game in particular that I like, is that there isn't just one way to go about all this. Somtimes you can be sneaky and try and get around without being seen, or take out any guards before the sound an alarm. Another way is to just run into battle (which I wouldn't recommend). There are so many ways to make your way through the levels. And even though combat was for the most part repetetive, there were some new enemies introduced as the game proceeded, which made the game a bit harder, though not that much harder. The game also introduced new elements to the game as it proceeded which made the experience a bit more dynamic. However, every now and again, the game struggeled a bit with finding where to place the camera, and it gave me some confusing moments. Other times Lara (the main character) would not grab on to the zip line (and thus fall to her death). But other than that I don't really have any complaints.\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\nShould you buy this game? Yes, it will provide you with a great deal of fun, and you will definitely enjoy the experience."

    "prompt": "以下の2つのデータグループを比較して、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない表現パターンや内容の特徴を特定してください。\n\n【グループA】\n- [b][i]Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout[/i][/b] is a 60 Player Battle Royal game of minigames to triumph over everybody for the sweet, GOLDEN CROWN\n[list]\n[*] Put in about 40 hours in combination on Beta 1 & 2\n[*] Won a ton and lost a ton\n[*] Enjoyed EVERY SECOND \n[/list]\n[b][u]PROS[/u][/b]\n[list]\n[*] Decent amount of minigames for launch, and even when you play the same ones they feel fun when different things happen\n[*] Games go fast if you're winning OR losing, you're able to play a lot and experience the game faster to get better\n[*] The BIG majority of the cosmetics in the game are NOT locked behind a paywall.

There is NO stress\n[/list]\n[b][u]CONS[/u][/b]\n[list]\n[*] See-saw minigame is very advantaged to the players in the front due to how messed up the see saws behind you get clogged with players and being on sides for WAY too long\n[*] Grabbing is a bit weird and janky, sometimes its useful and sometimes it actually screws you over\n[*] Ragdoll physics sometimes cause you to roll a ton after falling (I like this feature a ton but others don't)\n[/list]\n\n[b] I definitely reccommend picking this game up. The Devs put a lot of time and effort into a game and for $20 it is actually steal. This game will provide hours of content, especially with them already announcing they will update with new cosmetics and mini-games as ready. Please give this game a shot :)\n- load in get attacked by a man named pizza team up with a guy named dylan to kill pizza, pizza runs a way loot all the bags from dead ppl on the ground go with dylan up north meet one more to add to the group find dylans friend adds him to the group keep goingf north meet 3 more on the way and add to the group get to a town in the north take it over kill every in site find a cowboy hat and a backpack start a gang called the motorcycle cowboy cap gang get into a fight with 3 other players get shot in the back of head by an arrow say my fairwells to my gang and than respawn\n\n9000/10\nWould do it again in a heartbeat\n- My gambling addict friend said if I post a review on this game and it gets 150 likes and 25 Awards that he will buy me a case of beer. So I'm just gonna leave this here\n- [u]What I liked: [/u]\n[list]\n    [*]The story and characters\n    [*]The creative boss fights and wrench puzzles\n\n[/list]\n[u]What You Need to Know: [/u]\n[list]\n    [*]This game is not a normal metroidvania game that those looking for would like. The game is linear and with some backtracking mostly for optional stuff. The game is heavy on story and you will read A LOT, but you can skip it if you want.\n\n    [*]I’ll start with the gameplay. The simple combat you have is using a normal laser, bomb/missle gun, a heavy laser/swap gun and your wrench to kill or stun enemies. You get these at certain points in the game and as well as upgrades to your wrench to electrify it. This is used mostly in traversal and puzzles, not combat though.\n\n    [*]The game is overall very easy for those looking for a challenge unless you start the new game with one hit mode. The enemies and bosses you encounter are all unique in they look and attack patterns that each requires a different approach to killing them.  With some having to be avoided, stunned or more creative ways to get past them with tools acquired later.\n\n    [*]The bosses are the best part of the game. You have so much creativity in the design of each one that I wish there was a boss rush mode to replay them, minus a few. The developer didn’t make them insanely hard which most people, even me expect when hearing about bosses in games. They aren’t that hard, just require a certain way to defeat with even the annoying or unexplained bosses were still creative like a stealth boss, tag teaming with your companions, and using your wrench that fits and sets the game apart with the design of these bosses\n\n    [*]The game has chests you open for the “light Metroidvania” aspect that you get materials to craft passive abilities that you also find through various ways. This feels like an afterthought as it’s the only thing that makes this game from being just a straight linear game. Nothing wrong with that, but since it’s optional and not fully useful unless trying to 100% and find optional bosses. The abilities are useful, you can have 3 active. Each hit takes the abilities away until you get orbs to heal the slot from doing basic stuff, which in the world isn’t that bad, but during boss fights are worthless. So for me they felt like an afterthought or didn’t want them to be required to progress, which also makes since.\n\n    [*]The story is interesting and I didn’t skip it, it’s a mixed bag on tone though as the game is very heavy on religious and philosophical ideas, which I find interesting. It will get serious and then undercut with an out of place joke or 4th wall breaking reference. The game can also just use a character to preach at times. It felt like totally going against what the character vibe is. This makes the characters not as consistent and makes the characters that are very one simple even more shallow. The 2 most interesting characters were enemy agents that one would preach but that was his character and it fit with who he was and the other was a female that had mixed emotions over what she was doing and hated life. The four main characters didn’t have the same level of depth and at times would get annoying.\n\n    [*]The game does have one entire level and other areas that had elevators that would require so much backtracking to use these properly. Why they don’t have buttons to call elevators to the level your on is so stupid. That one entire level was annoying instead of interesting because of this. They can also not explain how to defeat certain bosses or what to even do.\n\n    [*]Overall the game was a blast to play and seeing this world and its characters, the interesting religious story and showing the many facets of it along with interesting villains. The fact that one guy made all these interesting bosses to fight blows my mind. But even the few mistakes or inconsistency I can’t wait to see what he creates next.\n\n [/list]\n\n[h1]My Score: [/h1]\n[b]B[/b]\n\n[b]Paid: $17[/b]\n[b]Completed in: 17 hours to 100%, even less if not backtracking[/b]\n\nGames similar I recommend: \n[list]\n    [*]Shovel Knight\n    [*]Ori and the Blind Forest\n    [*]The Talos Principle \n    [*]Axiom Verge\n    [*]Looking to try next: Owlboy\n\n [/list]\n- [h1]The Good[/h1]\n- Cop System.\n- Best progression in a need for speed game in years.\n- Genuinely fun and engaging, builds on the foundation of nfs2015 while taking the good mechanics from payback to make a compelling game. If the need for speed hype was still around people would stop asking for most wanted again because want it or not this is it, even if it falls short on a few cases.\n- Feel of \"speed\".\n- Insanely beautiful, runs super well, amazing lighting. Looks good on both day and night.\n- Day and night have different purposes in the game, and the fact you can choose is pretty cool as well. You can sweat if you want or if you want just races you can stay in the day.\n- Visual customization with community decals, let's go!\n- Online entirely optional, is kind of the same as nfs2015 instead of payback having the singleplayer map but instead allowing free roam drivers which is pretty cool\n- Car profiles like we have in forza, no more taking a racing car into the offroad! They actually perform as they should!\n- Good map\n- Crossplay\n- Character customization\n\n[h1]The Bad[/h1]\n- Cop System. It has a lot of rough edges that will piss you off. Yes it's the difficulty players wanted but also too much rubberbanding, \"rhino incoming\" taking half your screen not actually letting you see the rhino, game basically requiring you to abuse ramps because there's no proper way to actually deal with cops, etc.\n- Story is short and shitty. Payback as mid as it was did the \"corrupt cop\" storyline better\n- Progression system is taken back by the included powerful starter cars which came from the deluxe edition. It's fine since it's included but I hate how good features are destroyed with certain executive decisions\n- No post-release support, as it's the case with EA games\n- Need origin to play\n- Lots of bugs\n\n[h1]Neutral[/h1]\n- Overall teenager aesthetic. I like the neon style, but the overall teenager stuff and spanish characters (which are here because of the la casa de papel trend) just don't click with me. I just cringe all over the marketing material and how the characters engage\n- 21:9 support is fine not considering the map which doesn't scale to 21:9 unfortunately\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nThis is it boys. Need for speed is back!\n- This game can be great at times but extremely frustrating most of the time. 80% change to hit, miss every time. I can't keep playing a game with so much crappy coding.\n- This game was a real treat. I played the 1st Valfaris and became an instant fan. I love that this is direction went by the developers, I feel it was a really good evolution of the series and mixing it up with a shoot em up gives it that extra punch/kick/slash. The graphics, characters and bosses are just so awesome and you can feel the grittiness of the mechs. Aside from the awesome game play, the environments and atmosphere has really leveled up. Love the boss destruction sequence as you can feel that accomplishment of kicking its ass. looking forward to Valfaris next installment. Congratulations with this metal AF game!\n- -This game is like the combination of old PC sidescroller like Duke Nukem (pre-3d), NES Contra, and arcade Metal Slug with 80s /90s cyberpunk and action movie tropes.\n-The cheesy humor, plot, and music is top notch. Might look like a shallow nostalgia at a glance but once you played it, they even spiritually nailed the silliness of similar games/story in that era. The guns, the character acting and lines, the costume design, etc.\n-It's not as fast paced as I thought it would be. But actually that makes it relaxing to play. Easy to get into and the challenge is just right for me without being frustrating. \n-I like how the enemies and characters are pretty diverse. \n-I haven't finished the game but I feel like this game will have similar replay value like Streets of Rage 4. Not because of there are many things to do or getting better at the game but because it's somehow just simply tight, fun, and arcadey to replay.\n- [b][i]AMID EVIL[/i] is very much [i]Quake[/i] 1 level design in a [i]Hexen[/i]/[i]Heretic[/i] universe.[/b] It's well done. We're a bit spoiled this year with outstanding '90s FPS shooters. Personally, I prefer both [i]Ion Maiden[/i] and [i]DUSK[/i] over this title for the following reasons:\n\n1) I find [i]AMID EVIL[/i] to be a bit generic in terms of theme; the fantasy setting could use a bit more to set it apart.\n\n2) I prefer real or low fantasy weapons/guns over wands and totally high fantasy weapons. Now, don't get it twisted - I appreciate that these high fantasy weapons exist, but yeah, they leave something to be desired. I miss reloading and all of that. \n\n3) The level design in [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is much more 'sprawling' (for lack of a better term) just like the original [i]Quake[/i]. Most levels are indoors in what feels like an underground compound (at the time of writing this review). I personally like the backwoods feel of [i]DUSK[/i], or the dystopian cityscape of [i]Ion Maiden[/i] far more. I want to look up at the sky in most levels.\n\n4) The enemy design is different than the other two games I mention, which is good - but they all mostly have a 'same' kind of feel. The enemies are all super fast, so most of your efforts are focused on running backwards while fending them off. It's fun, but gunplay isn't quite as fun as the other two games for this particular reason.\n\n5) The font and overall menu system definitely feels 'Early Access'. I know the font is being worked on, which is desperately needed. \n\n6) My favorite way to play the game is Endless mode - and I feel like that's a flaw in itself. It's the opposite for me with [i]DUSK[/i]. I want to fall in love with the campaign, but eh, there isn't really any story or anything all that interesting to suck me in. The secrets are super easy to find compared to the other two games, too.\n\n7) No multiplayer. Now, I really don't care about this - but who designs a game in this genre without building this in from the ground up? You know the community is going to whine about this. Questionable design decision to say the least.\n\n[b]Well, it sounds like I just dumped all over the game.[/b] Please don't get me wrong. [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is a welcome addition to the genre. The *great news* is that this is not just some reskin of [i]DUSK[/i] - it certainly is it's own thing. And that's really important. \n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+Fairly polished game for Early Access\n+It's the most modern version of the original [i]Quake[/i] we've seen this year\n+Well optimized\n+Lots of content right now\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-The universe is generic\n-No multiplayer\n-The font is too hard to read\n-Music is nothing to write home about\n-The secrets are easy, and there really aren't all that many of them\n-Weapons could use more 'oomph' to them; also we should be able to use the special ability when we want to as opposed to it autotriggering\n\n[b]I was psyched out of my mind for [i]AMID EVIL[/i] - and while it is certainly good - I think I'll be focused more on [i]DUSK[/i] and [i]Ion Maiden[/i].[/b] Because, let's face it, gaming time is valuable and we can't play everything.\n- I vividly remember the moment when I gave up on Fallout 3: I was the ruins of some city, with a grey sky looming over the shredded grey concrete shells of buildings, and vast chunks of broken grey highway was wrapped up against, around, over and under huge chunks of grey concrete. My companion had gotten stuck somewhere in the grey sea of rubble for the umpteenth time, and it just suddenly struck me: This game isn't fun. It's just depressing.\n\nA few years later, I recalled this experience to a friend of mine, and he assured me: \"Fallout 4 isn't grey. It's got colors. And it's good.\" Having banked 1410 hours in game, I would have to say he was right.\n\nIs Fallout 4 good RPG? Nope. The story is rubbish, the characters extremely shallow, and the skill tree is very meh. If you hate VATS, like I do, the skill tree is complete rubbish. Is it good because it is bug free and has good DLC's? Nope. Is it good because it's the best shooter ever? Nope. Fallout 4 is good game because it's fun, and it's fun because it's a decent shooter, with an OK open world, good atmosphere and a sense a humor. Slap some of the 1000's of existing mods on that, and there's a decent chance that the next time you emerge from the elevator of Vault 111, switching to the catchy tunes of Diamond City Radio as you ready your gun and take in the not-grey landscape, you'll be smiling, just like I do.\n\nUpdate: Due to the recent Skyrim \"update\", breaking mods and introducing paid mods, and a similar downgrade being reported as coming for Fallout 4, I can no longer recommend this game, or any other Bethesda product.\n- One of my favorite Final Fantasy games, the story, characters, and setting are just too perfect. The music is amazing and I love the ARPG style combat. I think they did an amazing job of deviating from the standard JRPG with this game.\n\nWhy on earth do I not recommend it then?\n\nBecause the Steam version is BROKEN. The last update Square Enix did gave the game a horrible stutter and memory leak so that the game's extremely painful to play. There's no mod that fixes it like Nier: Automata either. The only way to fix it is to roll back your game version, which means no Ardyn DLC, no Comrades DLC, a bunch of other DLC items get removed, and you're stuck playing an inferior version of the game.\n\nMost developers would fix that ASAP. But Square Enix doesn't understand the PC platform or value their PC gamer customers enough to be bothered with fixing their broken games. I say this as one of the biggest fans of the Final Fantasy franchise there is. I love Final Fantasy from the bottom of my heart. But Square Enix's business practices are unacceptable.\n\nImagine if a car company put out a car and it turned out the brakes didn't work and the car company just said \"Well, we moved our factory staff onto the next product, so you'll just have to drive around without brakes.\"\n\nThat's basically what Square Enix is doing with this game.\n\nFIX YOUR MISTAKE, SQUARE ENIX.\n\nFrom a loyal fan and customer who's bought nearly every Final Fantasy game on multiple platforms.\n- \"it's a puzzle game dressed up as a wargame\"\n\n1. puzzle games don't have this much randomness\n\n2. it uses authentic hex wargame conventions/mechanics so it's more of a puzzle game built out of a wargame\n\n3. you can take the puzzle element out of it by customizing your game.yml file to allow +5 turns, then play each scenario slow\n- Would be nice to get a definitive upgrade rather than paying full price for dragon quest xi definitive version\n- Great game! At times it can get frustrating (boss battles), but the good out weighs the bad by a landslide. Even when i did get mad, which was a lot, I never stayed mad for long. There is just far too much to enjoy about the game. The art style is just simply amazing, the movement of your character around the world is just so satisfying once you get used to it, the puzzles aren't too easy or too hard, and everything in the game just goes together pretty much perfectly. All in all this game is extremely well made. Would recommend buying if you want a super unique experience 11/10\n- This game deserves a more in depth review than it has had yet, so I'll do my best.\n\nBetween the campaign and the puzzles there is some good content that will make you think hard.\nThe Campaign's final battle was suitably epic.  Unfortunately, beating the campaign and trying all of the puzzles and only failing on 2 out of 17 puzzles, both of which I think were bugged, only took me 13.8 hours.  paying the 6 USD sale price for 13.8 hours of good fun, I think I got my money's worth, but I've had better deals. \n\n what would give this endless hours of fun would be if the multiplayer or offline vs. CPU modes were good.  Unfortunately I've tried searching for multiplayer games without being able to find any.  It seems like this game got buried in mass of games being produced nowadays and noone bought it, so unless you have a steam friend you can buy this game for and convince to play it with you or this game shocks everyone with a second wind of sales then multiplayer just isnt going to happen.  Multiplayer also lacks a menu where you could potentialy see what other players games are going on and have an option to observe those games if those players allowed observers into their games.\n\nthe Offline VS. CPU mode didn't impress me either.  This and multiplayer are the only modes where you can build your deck from the full complement of cards in the game.  The Campaign, while fun, doesnt even use a deck in 6 of the 9 missions, and when it does use a deck, your card choices are heavily limited.  Unfortunately, the CPU AI is pretty bad, so I can't realy test what cards are good or bad effectively in the VS. CPU mode.  Another feature I would have liked to see for the VS CPU mode would have been the ability to play with or give the CPU a random deck.  there is no random deck option, you have to pick your opponents deck, so you know what they have.\n\nOne thing that disappointed me from Steam's side is that in the window for \"similar to games I play\" on this game's store page, it didn't list Pox Nora.  This game is infact similar to Pox Nora and less buggy than that game.  Last I played Pox Nora was like 2 years ago though but I have over 390 hours in that game.\n\nOverall I'll give this game a 6.8/10  I wanted to give it a higher score, and I still do reccomend it.  It is good fun and takes a good amount of thinking hard for about 13.8 hours.  Understand that if you do buy it, chances are you probably wont find yourself playing it much longer than that.\n\n- Okay this is a weird situation. I personally don't like this game all that much, but I do still recommend it nonetheless. That's because despite me not being personally huge on it, I can't deny that it is a very well-crafted game that definitely will give people the experience they want if this is the type of game they're looking for. I, turns out, am not part of the crowd that is targeted for said experience. I just found the whole trial and error stealth RTS style of this game to just not be my cup of tea, but again I can't deny its very well-crafted. I also think the art style and voice acting and story are all very well done as well. So yeah, if you're fond of games of this type, then go for it. I'm sure you won't be disappointed. I, for one, don't think I'm entirely sold on it though.\n- Disclaimer: This is review from player who prefer story-rich game and haven't played any game by Arkhouse Telegraph.\n\nThe good:\n+ Outstanding 80's-esque visual pixel artstyle. It reminds me of few SNES/Atari/Gameboy games.\n+ Fairly good soundtrack.\n+ Some cutscene/area have fascinating atmosphere.\n+ Run well with Steam proton, so it's likely this game is playable for Linux/Steam Deck user. Although the platformer area might show too many small detail for 7\" display.\n+ Game OST/artbook is available for free on Arkhouse website.\n\nThe bad:\n- While i understand nature of this game require player to find out most thing and go through trial-and-error, some parts definitely need to be explained better. I refer to lack of autosave (for most part of the game), not letting player know about manual save (you can do it by head left after exit for cylinder elevator until you see display/sign \"< S\" and suggestion to visit block H (where you get some guidance).\n- While the manual say i can play R. U. N. E. 3000 first, i have hard time understanding the story and lore/world building. Conversation such as \"DO? DORODO!\" is mostly gibberish and i only can make vague guess based on few specific term (\"V2\", \"50/50\", etc.) and area i've visited. Short recap of previous games (even it's on the manual) could be really helpful for newcomers.\n\nThe ugly:\n* I experience a bug where i fight boss i'm not supposed to fight yet. In detail, [spoiler] after i exit from P block to get symbol cracking code, i was thrown to G block where i fight G-Cat/10th boss. The worst part is the boss HP bar started with red color and auto 3-60 cannon never perform attack. Fortunately the bug doesn't occur again after i load from manual save.  [/spoiler].\n* The gameplay variation/idea is very interesting, but the execution is mixed bags (more explanation on below paragraph)\n\nSaturn Quest: R. U. N. E. 3000 has lots of gameplay variant/modes (Adventure, Shoot'em up, Platformer and many more) to keep the game fresh. While each area/boss have different reason why it's challenging/difficult, many of those is very unbalanced. For example, [spoiler] Bioplatus M-3D/6th boss [/spoiler] require you to have extraordinary eye-hand coordination and multitasking skill. Among all enemy that resemble boss fight, i only managed to beat 6-7 boss without using cheat.\n\nThis game also has very few checkpoint on each area/boss. On adventure/platformer area, you could restart from beginning after spending 10-20 minutes where you have to avoid same trap or collect same item again. On boss fight, that means you'll need to repeat whole fight most of the time. It's could be annoying because since you're forced to find out boss behavior the hard way or repeating tedious part of the fight.\n\n3 HP and lack of difficulty option could be irritating for most modern player. There are time when i found out i only lose 3-10 HP when i use cheat and beat the boss. If there's easier difficulty where i have 6-10 HP, i could beat more boss by myself. But don't get me wrong, i feel really satisfied each time i beat boss (which i deemed can be beaten with practical amount of effort) without cheat. If the developer bother add easy difficulty which has higher player HP, give more Nana and slightly lower boss HP, far more people could enjoy this unique piece of artwork.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nWhile i have some rant, it's really unique experience even though i've played few hundred games. In overall, i have more positive sentiment than negative sentiment of this game. But even though i choose \"Yes\" when Steam ask \"Do you recommend this game?\", i'd rather choose \"Neutral\" or \"Information\" instead. If you're fan of 80's game or really like difficult game, you might come to like this game. But for most people, i'd recommend you to seek other game. Although if you really insist to play this game, you could use Cheat Engine and modify HP/Nana using value type Double (also called float64 or 8-byte float).\n\nP.S. I definitely will play the sequel (Episode IV-VI: White Meteor Saga according to the artbook) [b]IF[/b] the developer bother add easy difficulty option and more checkpoint during boss fight/exploration.\n- Their last privacy agreement update (January 1st, 2021) states they will \"sell\" users information, including name, email and billing address to third party companies (including social media and advertising). There is no other way of playing the game without accepting those terms, very sad practices for a paid game really.\n- its a very stressful game and rly hard but the fact that u can lose all ur progress because of a mistake is on another level of insane but in the end if u r determined u will finish it and the feeling when u finish it after all the time is very good i never felt this good in my life about finishing a game or a puzzle its a rly good game i recommend\n- Mixed review, so I will list the good and bad:\n\nGood:\n-Fun to play with friends\n-You have stuff to do for 20+ hours\n-Exploring and survival is done well\n-In creative you can build a pirate ship\n\nBad:\n-Sometimes lag\n-Sometimes trouble locating islands\n-Alone this is boring (sorry shark, you are not enough company)\n-My alpaca named Marcel keeps dying because he refused to eat (fixed now but rip 4 Marcels)\n\nEdit:\n+New engine and rudder added much control\n+New islands are easily explored by one person\n+Lore added\n+Finally you can charge your empty batteries\n+Finally you can too farm honey on your raft\n+Character models to find\n-Biofuel consumption and making is a meh for me\n-If you add saltwater too fast to the filter you lose the empty bottle or cup\n- More broken than Cyberpunk could ever dream. Sure the game has nice graphics but the game play, toxic online players, and poor physics make this one of the most frustrating games I have ever played. Dont even bother using the stable either your game will glitch and youll be stuck looking at you player stuck in the stable and nothing more causing you to reset the game or the rogue horses that will drive by kick you in the face. Good luck if you play.\n- The latest S tier Deckbuilder Roguelike, joining the ranks of Slay the Spire and Monster Train for me. I think that's all that really needs to be said.\n\nIt leans heavily into kiss/curse type effects, if you like the ability to manipulate rng and do some busted stuff with your sequencing you will love it. It is more of a thinker on a turn to turn basis than other games of this genre, but if that isn't a turn off then it's a really solid game with some unique characters/mechanics that feel fresh.\n- I like the game, but I'd recommend waiting for the full release.\nDon't get me wrong, the game is beautiful and it's got great potential. The problem with it is, mostly, the keybindings. They are incredibly uncomfortable to use and you cannot change them.\nPlus, the dialogues sometimes feel never ending and quite pointless.\n- Edited\n\nI Didn’t have high expectations for this game. I read the reviews and expected a mediocre game from ubisoft. I was let down big time. I was given a watered down version of Syndicate that had terrible game mechanics.\n\tAs I navigated the first enemy compound I came across it felt difficult to navigate through the grass and between the buildings. Clearly not developed as a stealth game. Once I had given up on the whole stealth aspect of the mission I was very easily able to slaughter all of the guards in the compound. I trying using the bow but it’s hard to use compared to Tomb Raider and Far Cry Primal’s easy to use bow. Sword combat could have been improved but it wasn’t the worst I’ve seen. No skill required, just click the mouse button rapidly to kill all of the guards in your path. The devs clearly didn’t try that hard because they knew that people would by their game anyways because of Ubisoft and Assassin’s Creed fanboys.\n\tAssassin’s Creed: Origins could’ve been an amazing game that would revolutionize the series but no. The devs had to ruin that possibility by being lazy and making a watered down version of Syndicate. I’ve played Syndicate quite a bit and I thought it was a good game. Don’t get this game for the full price or even for $35. Let’s hope Ubisoft gets their shit together and doesn't fuck up Far Cry 5.\n\nThank you for your time.\n- WHERE ARE MY OG DS FANS OF THIS GAME? REJOICE BRUDDAS!\n\nNo but seriously, I loved this game to DEATH when it first came out on the DS and to now see an HD version of this game on steam. It's quite a whiplash but a good one! To anyone who loves mystery/ detective games, YOU NEED TO GET THIS!!! Good story, soundtrack and gameplay <3 AHHHHHH!!!\n- DO NOT BELIEVE WHAT EVERYONE ELSE IS SAYING. This game is a bloody masterpiece, it just takes the proper skill and knowledge to properly play it. There are proper real life mechanics which are fun as well as true to the real life process of making games. I personally have less than half an hour of experience with this game, showing that this is a captivating game that really draws you in and makes you beg for more. This is one of the games which will definitely be up there for GOTY. winkyface\n- This version comes bundled together with some kind of horrid bloatware called \"Steam\" which functions as a type of DRM meaning you do not actually own the game. Avoid at all costs, buy it on CD instead!\n- Imagine releasing an \"update\" that breaks peoples games/ mods, JUST SO YOU CAN PUT A BANNER AD IN THE MENU FOR BL3. Just WOW.\n- UPDATE: This remains to be one of the best games I have ever played. The company that created the game though... One more launcher that is completely unnecessary. The performance with the 'next-gen' update is horrible. I have half the fps I used to have on the very same rig and that is after going lower with the settings that I used to have. Why did you have to do this b U Ll $I t?\n\n\nThe best way to embrace the true greatness of this game is to look on how the series has improved since the first and the second part of The Witcher. You simply won't find anything that hasn't changed for the better.\n\n- Vast open world that IS NOT randomly created and filled with dull stuff,\n- Story which engages you from the first 10 minutes to the very end,\n- Graphics, even despite the whole controversy of a thing called downgrade, still makes this game THE BEST LOOKING RPG ever created,\n- Soundtrack, it finally goes back to the style presented originally in The Witcher 1, something that makes you forget that's just the video game, it gives you the feeling you are in there, in some village, city or that you are fighting with someone / something, which turns every single battle into an unforgettable memory,\n- Every single side quest, and believe me, there is A LOT of them, is actually a little story that keeps you playing with the same force as the main quests - I call it - a new quality in RPGs,\n- Choices and their impact on the story - even a small choice that seems insignificant at the time can wage on the whole world around you,\n- THIS GAME IS MATURE, finally a game dealing with a lot of subjects which are usually handled very childishly or not at all,\n- Combat - nothing more to add, it's decent, though it's nothing to be praised really, you won't be able to mash buttons and win - you have to dodge, use signs, and on higher difficulties get yourself ready to have an oil for a specific enemy and a bomb to be able to put an end to his or her misery.\n\nThe Witcher 3 is not a game without its flaws, although nothing that can't be fixed - some balance issues, economy basically showing Geralt as a very wealthy person (who he should not be), small performance problems like stuttering in Novigrad and in my opinion very limited after the end content (fixed by the expansions). Many of the things I struggled with have been already fixed and there is no need to disclose them. \n\nAll in all, one of the best games in the last few years (even a decade).\n- its in a forest\n- [h1] Brief summary of why the Chinese players are so pissed: [/h1]\n\nThe reason for the chinese players to absolutely despise the third party modding website is that the \"official modding\" was promised to be released over a year ago, but kept getting delayed. When it finally got released, everyone felt betrayed because it was a garbage third party website with so many restrictions.\n\nBut the reason why the game is still getting review bombed is the [b] developer's initial response [/b] to the first round of complaints. The team was dead silent for about 2 weeks, no comments about all the fiasco, yet people that were complaining about the modding on the chinese forums got their accounts banned left and right. Thats why many resorted to steam review bombing, and almost as soon as the steam review tanked, the developer came out and said the steam workshop will be launching in the end of the month, something he had being saying was \"really hard for the team\" and kept \"facing difficulties\" for the past year.\n\nSo yeah.... I kinda understand why people are still really mad about this one\n- Before you play this, make sure you play these games in order. That is:\n- To the moon\n- Finding Paradise\n- Imposter factory.\n\nAs for this game, it is another gorgeous story that takes you on a journey into the realm of memories. I encourage you to play these games blindly and to read nothing about the story because that's what I did, and I was surely surprised and mindblown. As for the ending of this game, I am still processing it to this day!\n\nI can't wait to play the next game by Freebird Games.\n- Fall Guys had a rough start. Unstable servers and people cheating to win. About a year later I picked it up again and I must say it really has improved a lot. I honestly don't have any issues which cheaters anymore and the servers don't crash on me anymore.\n\nIt's also getting more and more stages to play so it feels refreshing to play a few rounds every day.  The events for certain skins are also really fun. Sure there could still be some improvements like personal usernames or maybe a way to trade in skins you don't want. But I feel like they listen to their community and are aiming to make it as fun as possible. I'm interested to see how Fall Guys will keep evolving!\n- As a Spider-Man fan, this game is a real treat. It was fantastic 4 years ago on release for the PS4, and it's even more fantastic now that it's finally on PC. If you're a Spidey fan, especially one who deeply appreciates the mythos and the message is represents, then this game is 100% for you. The writing, visuals, audio and gameplay are all wonderful, through and through. It's a true labour of love, Insomniac did an incredible job. Bring on the Miles Morales port!\n- It's one of my favorite games of all time, yet I cannot recommend it. And it pains me.\n\nLike many others, I think that the latest update, alpha 17, was a huge step in the wrong direction. Instead of being a zombie-survival game with awesome building mechanics where you could build huge and massive bases, it simply became a zombie-killing grindfest, where bases don’t matter, because zombies chew through concrete like it was nothing.\n\nAlso, don't get me started on the zombie AI. It was fine in alpha 16 and the zombies acted as you would expect; dumb. In alpha 17, the pathing of the AI is just ridiculous, where the zombies are able to estimate the path of least resistance, as if they were not only sapient, but extremely intelligent. This has led to the current base building-meta; mazes and ramps. /facepalm\n\nThe skill system was utterly destroyed as well. In Alpha 16, you could improve cardio by running, you could improve mining-efficiency by, well mining - so on so forth. Now, you just kill zombies to gain exp, get perk points and then spend said perk points. To be fair, they have buffed exp gains from other activities recently, but you still simply gain and spend perk points - yet another horrible downgrade.\n\nAlso, let’s talk about loot. In Alpha 16 you could loot items ranging from quality 1 to 600. Weapons and certain tools had components of individual quality that you could then combine to form said weapon/tool, that would have the average quality level of said parts. The quality would determine the damage/durability of the weapon etc. This system was great and gave an incitement to go out in the world and continue to loot, even if you had, say the AK47, because you could improve it vastly by finding better parts. This has been replaced by a system where all weapons/tools are looted whole in a quality system ranging from 1 to 6. Yes, 1 to 6. Minimal difference in damage/durability, but hey, at least you can attach mods to the weapons now. The amount of mods you can attach are determined by the level of the item. You can now improve the damage of your rifle by painting it in another color. Great…\n\nThe performance of the game… hehehehe. All the new textures and lighting of A17 has brought so many performance issues, and yet again, it used to be just fine in Alpha 16. Don’t bother mentioning it to the devs, they’ll just give you a douchy response about your rig being a potato, even though you’re running with high-end parts. \n\nIn conclusion, no I would not recommend the game. However, you can opt in for playing Alpha 16, which I would recommend – if you can accept that the game might never evolve any further.\n- The core game is fun, and scratches an itch for miniatures combat that I often have.\n\nTwo reasons I don't recommend: \n(i) the single player AI is quite easy once you figure it out.  You can face challenging scenarios but it's because at higher difficulty levels the AI adds sheer weight of numbers. It doesn't get appreciably smarter, so the only challenge you face is how to funnel larger, dumb formations of enemies to come at you.  The campaign mode is just a series of battles against randomly generated forces with extremely thin randomly-generated narrative interludes of about a paragraph in length, with no strategic map, or concepts of supply or resources. It does not meaningfully extend the length of time single player is fun.\n\n(ii) Multiplayer relies on too many things that are opaque to people who have just played single player.  There are a lot of rules and features (like how you get sub-commanders - it comes down to arcane placement of cavalry troops in setup), that are not documented in the rules or in any tutorial.  Unless you are willing to read the forums for both this game and the original game and try to glean this information, you will be perpetually at a disadvantage against the majority of the community who have been playing since the first game.  \n\nIf you like miniatures tabletop gaming and have lots of spare time to devote to the game to learning it in spite of the game not fully explaining its mechanics or giving feedback to you on enemy actions, it will be worthwhile.  Otherwise, the single player experience by itself doesn't warrant buying at full price. Worth it at 50% off.\n- Great gameplay with baaad user experience. There are no tooltips or explanations as to what is going on at all, just kinda gotta figure it out. Otherwise the gameplay is smooth and there's a climb mode called spiral, slay the spire style, very fun. 5 different classes all able to level their decks and get new cards and abilities until lvl 30 I think, got my enchantress to 20 but still more to go. Story mode is more of a tutorial but still interesting.\n- PC version doesn't have rebindable controls for controller for some reason\n\nupdate: i have finished the game, still no rebindable controls, i can give a real review now. i wouldn't rate it negative but i wouldn't rate it positive either. this is a \"eh\" review.\n\nthe game is two games at once and neither of them are great.\n\n the roguelike part is like 20% of the game and is very simple and shallow, there's like 5 weapons and they all play the same, its also super easy. its ok but its not as good as a real roguelike.\n\n the cult building part is 80% of the game and is a bit more fun but past the earlygame its a bit eh too. choosing what you get doesn't really matter since you'll unlock everything pretty fast, and the doctrines 90% of the time are a choice between 2 useless things and 10% of the time a choice between a busted thing and a useless thing. the randomly generated quests the followers give you are just chores like revisiting old dungeons you already completed and the reward is pretty much nothing. its ok but its not as good as a real colony builder.\n\nnone of the systems in either part of the game are particularly deep.\n\nas of the time of this review, the game is still quite glitchy, though being patched by the devs.\n\nthe game is about 15 hours with side content and 18 hours for a completionist run. no real replayability \n\ni'd just recommend you get a full on action roguelike if you want to play a roguelike, or a full on colony builder if you want to play a colony builder. this game does both but is not great at either of them. \n\n game is very cute tho and the soundtrack is great. like 5/10\n- Do you kinda like 4X games, but mostly the first 2-3 hours of the game where you're exploring and hacking a basic civilization out of the wilderness and desperately fending off natural threats while trying to keep people fed and productive? If so, this game is for you. Nice tight gameplay loop where things never get stagnant for too long; always novel threats and opportunities, and you're not tied to any one settlement for very long, so victory and defeat alike are more temporary. Not to mention a really astounding amount of fun, polished content for an early access game! Eremite, Hooded Horse, I salute you.\n- This was released alongside about 10 other big Steam releases around the end of October 2022 and so it is very tempting to joke about how it's better than all of those combined, the real GOTY so on and so forth, as I'm sure has been done already. But what I noticed was that out of all those releases, this one had an emphasis on comedy, which is very difficult to execute successfully in any form of media. There is no voice acting or any high-budget production so how the dialogue and seemingly basic visuals/animations kept me entertained throughout, just like the previous 2 games (from memory) is a tremendous achievement. At a point where I have played a bazillion high-budget action games, and will honestly play a bazillion more, games like this only become more important in showcasing how creative independence is imperative in creating uplifting experiences.\nAfter the prologue, seeing Frog Detective step out of the train and the camera pausing on his full-body shot was akin to, say, if I saw Shepherd step out of the Normany in ME4, or if I saw Keanu step out of a train in John Wick 4, it was really on that level for me.\nThough, I feel like the dance scenes at the end of this game was a step-down from Frog Detective 2 unfortunately, but still good.\n\nEdit: I nominated this game for 'Outstanding Visual Style' Steam Award!\n- [h1] Look at my hours real quick. That's about. 4 hours? [/h1]\n\nFallout 76 is boring. There's no other way to put it. The Core objective of Fallout 76 was to gear the Fallout 4 engine for multiplayer. They succeeded! The art is visually amazing, even down to the 2D art shown all over this store page, so what's wrong?\n\nConsider who's still playing this game. Who's desperate enough to play this game? Well, It's not a lot of people. And they aren't very good people. It's just people. Existing. I had 0 conversations during my 4 hours. \n\nLets talk playing. The game is boring. Since I just mentioned the objective, lets talk about the NPC's ETC. [b] I got this game for free, I cannot emphasize how little this game means to me. It's terrible. [/b] The NPC's & story were not part of core development therefore the game suffers. You get stuck doing some quests you don't care about and play a game you'd rather not play. The NPC's are essential as expected so, you cannot kill them either. \n\nMicrotransactions Via Atomic Shop & Premium plague the game [i] but lets talk about more! [/i] There's free events like a crate dropping & player trading outposts. Wanna know what's wrong here? The game boils down to, find a player trading outpost and buy sh*t, or just dropping crates? well the crates are full of nothing. the games gear-towards premium really gives you nothing in terms of loot so you're playing what is a hollow, unfinished, boring, game. Even in 2021! \n\nCreatures & enemies are cool however there's a big issue of the game not being cool. You may say its worth it to play just to engage the wild-life but even they feel soul-less and void of life. I don't know how you make a game so devoid of soul really. I've met mannequins with more personality than anything I met in Fallout 76. \n\nThe world isn't interesting, it's a barren void forestry area. Sometimes you get a tiny bit of quest, however aside from this game being a complete and utter lore-destroyer for those interested, what it does leave is not good enough to compensate for all of the cons. Honestly, if this was a mod for 4, I'd feel better. But even when getting this for free, I feel scammed.\n\n[b] I'll end this by repeating my hours. 4. At no point was I excited. Enthralled. Interested. I sat for 4 hours, wanting to tear my hair out and scream, because I was so bored. I had tests in school, more interesting than this. The entire 4 hours I spent playing, I wish I had played anything else, & I got this for free! I genuinely wish you the best of help if you end up buying this game. It's horrific. [/b]\n- Oh, that The Resident Evil (The RE)… One of the best stories in the gaming industry! The Capcom is well done that decided to remake games. Many players criticize The RE3, but I understand them, the game is quite short, there are no horror elements in the game. But the game has become easier, for example, a knife does not wear out. The players did not forget to criticize the Nemesis too, saying that there is no element of surprise and persecution, and there’s no sense of the constant presence of someone, who can mutilate you. The Nemesis means in English as “a good script”. However, the game creators tried to convey the atmosphere of The RE and the horror that the doomed city is filled with. Well-chosen actors, excellent voice acting, correctly conveyed the atmosphere of the city. I would add more moving elements on the destroyed streets of the city, like people or zombies\nTotal score: 8.5/10\n- What starts as a simple game of jumping over some spikes quickly becomes something so much more. Geometry dash is like Minecraft. No matter how many times you quit, you always come back to it (as you can see by my 700 hours of playtime). For $3.99 you get such an amazing and memorable experience. This game tests your patience and persistence. It tests your emotions. It encourages you to push yourself, overcoming challenges you once thought impossible.\n\n(SHORT ANSWER)\nGet this game.\n- I really liked the concept of this game of navigating through orbits to collect crates and then successfully landing on the exit.  However, there just isn't enough content to justify it being sold as a complete product, especially at its current price of $6.99.  You see everything there is in the first couple of levels.  No new mechanics are added to the game as you progress.  The developer admits that the game is too simple and the fix was to add artificial difficulty to make the game longer.  For instance, rather than have intuitive controls using toggles, it requires the player to activate thrusters with one hand and turn them off with another.  The level design stops adding anything new and just adds more tedious narrow paths that must be navigated rather than an actual challenge or puzzles.  Finally, the DLC appears to be “pay to win” rather than getting any new content, it just gives the player access to aircraft that should be included already in the game.  By level 9 it is near impossible to progress any further with the default ship as it cannot accelerate fast enough to get through the small orbit and requires purchasing the DLC to advance the level.\n- The best driving simulator, period.\nUnmatched soft-body physics, customization, sounds, graphics - everything in BeamNG is close to perfection - and the game is still in early access! The only feature it lacks is visual customization (liveries, stickers, bodykits etc), but these aren't available in many autosims (looking at you, Assetto Corsa). Lots of quality mods which include cars, maps, and a freaking JATO rocket ensure you'll have hundreds of hours of fun here. Touge, track, drift, rally, time attack, offroad, rock crawling, drag - and with zero level loading screens; just a few seconds to switch your car. Zero DLCs, intuitive interface, and built-in gamepad support are also here. 10/10 worth your time and money.\n\nUpdate v0.24: where negative reviews come from\nAfter the major UI overhaul a lot of negative reviews were posted. Many of those call the game \"literally unplayable\" - which is obviously greatly exaggerated, unlike the other stated problem: lost controller presets. That one is actually unpleasant to deal with (judging from the reviewers' words, since I myself didn't experience a single problem with my DualShock4 nor with the game itself), but yet it was not a force majeure that could not be avoided, as every major update comes after a teaser - which should be a sign for everyone with a custom preset to save or write it down, just in case the update affects it.\n\nTo sum up, BeamNG.drive is still a nearly perfect-rated game - and a lot of the negative reviews are, to put it mildly, unjustified.\n\nUpdate: I love the new Covet.\n- ---{Gameplay}--- \n☑ Try not to get addicted\n☐ Very good\n☐ Good\n☐ Nothing special\n☐ Ehh\n☐ Bad\n☐ Just dont\n\n---{Graphics}---\n☐ Masterpiece\n☑ Beautiful\n☐ Good\n☐ Decent\n☐ Will do\n☐ Bad\n☐ Awful\n☐ Paint.exe\n\n---{Audio}--- \n☐ Eargasm\n☑ Very good\n☐ Good\n☐ Decent\n☐ Not too bad\n☐ Bad\n☐ Earrape\n\n---{Audience}--- \n☐ Kids\n☐ Teens\n☐ Adults\n☑ Everyone\n\n---{PC Requirements}--- \n☐ Check if you can run paint\n☑ Potato\n☐ Decent\n☐ Fast\n☐ Rich boi\n☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{Story}--- \n☑ Doesn't have \n☐ Something isnt nothing I guess\n☐ Not greatly told\n☐ Average\n☐ Good\n☐ Lovely\n☐ Will make you cry or smile alot\n\n---{Difficulity}--- \n☐ Just press a bunch of buttons\n☐ Easy\n☐ Significant brain usage \n☐ Easy to learn / Hard to master\n☐ Not so easy\n☑ Difficult\n☐ Dark Souls\n\n---{Grind}--- \n☐ Nothing\n☐ Only if you care about leaderboards/ranks\n☐ Isnt necessary to progress\n☐ A bit grindy sometimes\n☐ Average grind level\n☐ A bit grindy\n☑ Insanity\n\n---{Game Time}--- \n☐ Long enough for a cup of tea\n☐ Short\n☐ Average\n☐ Long\n☐ Depends on you\n☑ Endless\n\n---{Price}--- \n☑ Just buy it\n☐ Worth the price\n☐ Wait for sale\n☐ Maybe if you have some spare money left\n☐ Not recommended\n☐ Dont throw money into a rubbish bin\n\n---{Bugs/Glitches}--- \n☐ Never had any\n☑ Minor bugs/glitches\n☐ Few bugs/glitches \n☐ Can get annoying\n☐ Ruining the game\n☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs/glitches\n- First, there was Guitar Hero.

This is what I've been waiting for rhythm games to be like since Space Channel 5 on Dreamcast.\n- A Visual Novel meets The Stanley Parable by way of Disco Elysium. This game contains a shocking amount of depth of content and thematics behind it's excellent voice acting and 3-colour sketchy visual style. Well worth a play if you're intrigued.\n- Great Remaster, the same for Red alert 2 and Tiberium Sun next please!\n- >Be me\n>Move to new city for job offer\n>Go straight to bed when I arrive, but still oversleep and miss meeting with business contact\n>Have a message, but no contact information, so at suggestion of greasy hotel guy, I start randomly asking people on the street and café if they’re who I’m looking for\n>No luck, but random stranger points me to a club\n>Meet a cool chick who actually doesn’t treat me like a jerk\n>She has a boyfriend\n>Sad feelings\n>She invites me to a cool party anyway\n>Second person I talk to gives me a drink that really messes me up\n>Black out within first half hour of party\n>Wake up at cool chick’s house, she’s on her way to work\n>For some reason when I try to talk to her, I come across as a total stalker type.\n>Go to sleep\n>Next day, watch a train crash over some sort of secret agent\n>Mysterious hooded figure shows up, looms over g-man, then flees\n>Finally, some content, I think\n>Follow mysterious figure\n>Go into store, chase her into the basement\n>Door locks behind her\n>Weird guy there, gives me some backstory I promptly forget\n>Ask him every question that comes to me, but it won’t advance the plot\n>Wander around, not sure what to do\n>Not having fun\n>Meet a cool guy\n>He gives me a hacking device\n>Tells me he’ll teach me how to use it some other time\n>So much waiting\n>Finally run into guy who hired me and told me to move to this town\n>Tells me I’m fired\n>Go back to club\n>See cool chick\n>(only one of two people who actually treats me like a human being)\n>Talk to her\n>She calls me a stalker, I’m not sure why\n>Unable to defend myself\n>Weird basement guy tells me not to worry, invites me to another party\n>All I do is wander around and go to parties\n>Flashbacks of my real 20’s\n>Kill time until party by opening random doors and hacking a frying pan\n>Maybe I started a fire\n>Pass out in front of weird laser gate\n>Did I get electrocuted, or did I just fall asleep?\n>Go back to party\n>Weird guy tells me to loosen up and talk to girls\n>Girls all give me cold shoulder\n>Against better judgement, I drink several beers\n>Carry empties around with me because I can’t set them on counter\n>Weird guy tells me about a test\n>Won’t tell me how to take test, where to take test, or what I need to know to pass test\n>Worst party ever\n>Cool chick shows up again\n>She’s actually happy to see me\n>Try not to sound like stalker, kinda succeed, but I think I’m missing half the conversation\n>Also, I think cool chick might have a drinking problem\n>Me too, I’m staggering around\n>Drink coffee to try and sober up\n>Doesn’t work\n>Not having fun\n>Leave party\n>Kick lamp\n>Go to bed\n>Not tired enough to fall asleep\n>Wander around town, stumbling drunk, at 5 AM\n>Flashbacks to a dark time in my real life\n>Take drugs so time passes faster, flashbacks intensify\n>Talk to strangers since what else am I supposed to do\n>No one wants to talk to me\n>Cringingly accurate simulator of awkward college party years\n>Not fun game\n\nI hear from other reviews that this game starts to pick up after this point, but I can't do it anymore. I've already invested a lot of time and energy into this game for little to no return. I'm not going to study guides and waste more time on this game just so I can dig the nuggets of fun out of this wasted youth simulator. I will say that it did a really good job of making me role-play an awkward alcoholic with no job prospects and zero understanding of how to talk to women, living out of a ****** hotel room. But I've already played the real life version of that, so I can't recommend it. If you want to play a fun game about programming, go with Human Resource Machine. If you want a good role-playing game about hackers, go with Shadowrun. If you want to pay money and spend your leisure time feeling really depressed about your 20's, then I can recommend Else Heart.Break(), but maybe you'd be better off talking to a friend about it instead.\n- Indie games, second worst games after online free java and others.\n\nPro\n- music\n- pixel art\n\nCon\n- pixel art, too old, get on with times, we have enough of this\n- screen is constantly flickering with lines and colors, like interlacing, very bad,\n     put up a warning for epilepsy\n- incomprehensible story, looked up online because i couldn't understand\n    any of the nonsense and bad font system used\n- one hit death\n- no quicksave or checkpoint system\n- unskipable cutscenes, atrocious\n- annoying point's system pop up and can't see the screen full of enemies\n- too many enemies and autoaiming bots\n- last boss is a luck based win, 50 tries, then looked up for help, 20 more tries, win\n- can't see the whole map or at least realistically forward, the enemy is off screen\n    one shooting you, then from the beginning again, waste of my precious time\n- if enemies leave the building you get stuck and can't continue\n     if you didn't kill them they just flee\n- hit detection and object collision problems\n- no difficulty settings\n\n\n2/10 rating.      \n\nDon't pay more than 1$, i got it in a bundle, what a curse among better games.\n\nGlad i got to end credits, no need for answers and bonus levels, no-no, i had enough\n    of this horrid experience, seven and half hours, 30 minutes fun Max, the rest is a repetitive\n      waste of time, my blood pressure got up from this experience.\n- ***NEWBIES*** At least 50%, if not more, of this game is map knowledge. So don't beat yourself up if you're  super lost and everyone is yelling at you over game chat. Just mute the salty people and report them if they TK. Trust me there are a lot of people in the game that will back you up and want to help, so don't let one bad experience make you quit the game for good.\n\nThere are a LOT of maps to learn and a lot of small details in every one. It's going to take the average person until your siege level is at LEAST 50 before you really start recognizing map layouts and details on all maps - including room orientation, call outs, soft wall, hard wall, what should be reinforced in each site, common paths of travel, etc..  And then probably until 75 until you're actually comfortable with most maps and operators. I'll give 15% to your own gun skills, 20% to team work and communication (call outs call outs call outs, people. Don't be that guy that just looks at memes after dying.

Let's compare w Mario Maker, the most similar game to this one:\n\n[edit: Updated to compare to SMM2 instead of 1]\nWhat Mario Maker 2 Does Better\n- Mario\n- Different themes/gameplay physics across multiple mario games\n- Much larger playerbase\n\nWhat Levelhead Does Better\n- Oh my god the search functionality\n    - Search by creator, difficulty, tags, what's popular, etc.\n    - TL;DR you can find the awesome, and avoid the crap\n- Level discovery\n    - Can actively advertise my levels\n    - Get rewarded for playing people's levels\n- $20\n- Dying doesn't take 12 years to respawn\n- Fun, short campaign to slowly unlock more creative tools after seeing how they are used\n- Local Co-op (or online with Parsec)\n- Leaderboards (if you care, I personally don't)\n\nI cannot stress enough how AMAZING it is to not have to suffer through crap levels. The search functionality is soooo good; as a casual player, it is the sole reason I stopped playing Mario Maker 1. Mario Maker 2 is better, but it still falls terribly short. I think the best part is that Levelhead gives people control over the visibility of their levels, as well as incentives to play other peoples, and that is something that SMM2 unfortunately lacks.\n- Bad game. The story is bad, the graphics are meh, gameplay is bad and there isnt any nudity unlike the first one (to be clear the game doesnt say it has nudity so whatever) but at the end of the day its just a really bad game regardless. I understand that having the mirror name doesnt require nudity but everything is just slapped hastily slapped together to make a finished game. I had really high hopes from the devs of mirror but this was a big letdown as this game has nothing going for it unlike the quality nsfw elements that the first game had as its strong point.\n\nIf you are a weeb and you like the move the slot type games its ok but otherwise no need to play.\n- [h1]Diary: Dandara: Trails of Fear Edition[/h1]\n\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\n\n[table]\n[tr][td][b]Gameplay[/b][/td][td]Quick Gameplay, Interesting Movement Mechanics, Projectile based weapon, helping characters unlocks more paths[/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][b]Story[/b][/td][td]Interesting main story, fun side characters[/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][b]Graphics[/b][/td][td]Nice 2D pixel art[/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][b]Sound[/b][/td][td]Main Menu has nice sound effects, jumping from surface to surface sounds great[/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][b]Controls[/b][/td][td]Great controls, no need to remapping[/td][/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[table]\n[tr][td][h2]Day 1 - 3/23/2020[/h2][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td]I started up this game, not expecting much, and man oh man was I surprised. This game has fascinating gameplay, being able to jump from one surface of salt to another so smoothly and quickly. It makes the game different from others, because the movement and how you go around the map is so different. \n\nThe checkpoint system was a little odd to me. Your progress is still \"saved\" when you trigger a mechanic, it's just that the flag sets your spawn location. So there is no need to fret if you die after doing something important.\n\nI also got to use the stat system a lot today, and man, it reminds me of Dark Souls. If you die, you leave behind your salt, and you have to go back to collect it. Once you do, you can, of course, use it to buy upgrades from the tents for your character. Which is a nice way to choose how you want your character to grow. I like when my healing potions heal a lot, for example, instead of having a lot of base hp right from the start.

These new forced and [b][u]locked[/u][/b] key-binds are extremely biased in favor of [i]right-hand-dominant, able-handed[/i] persons and can not be remapped or swapped. However, as this function has been revoked from PC keyboard/mouse customers, it has been ADDED for console controllers. \n\nCapcom has yet to address or even acknowledge this change.\n\n[b]If you are left-handed, handicapped, or for other reasons require customizable mouse/keyboard functions, Capcom has forcefully revoked the ability for you to play this game anymore.[/b]\n- This HD remake of the PS2/DC classic Rez breathes some new life into a very old gem, however the update only harms its own image due to simple design mistakes and the enhancements that only highlight those mistakes further.\n\nThe PS2 controller made targeting slow and the game was intentionally timed to the slow pace at which you could target enemies. This meant the sound fx and visuals tied to targeting and shooting were all in sync with the music - that's at the core of the Rez experience. However the massively improved VR controls make targeting and shooting VERY fast. As a result all the sound effects and visuals play at once in a cacophony, the enemies die, and then you have a long 4 - 8 beat stretch of nothing as the backing track plods along, waiting for new enemies to spawn.\n\nWhat makes this worse is that the graphic updates end up being largely absent. Enemies filled the middle ground of the scene, captured your attention, and were the source of many particles, effects, the music, and animation - but since they all die quickly you're often left staring at the sky box with nothing happening. Then looking around in VR during these wait periods you can see how empty and simple the levels are because the HD parts are in the effects not the environments.\n\nThis all becomes especially noticeable in Area 5 when you demolish a mini boss and you're left sitting for 2-3 minutes floating through a desolate low-poly void with half the song missing. It feels like the game is broken. They should either have put a limit on the speed at which you can lock-on to enemies (matching to the BPM of the track), added more enemies to match the faster pace of this version, or filled the spaces with stuff to interact with so you can trigger the SFX/VFX where the music and visual upgrades are hiding.\n\nNo new player is going to know that the game is -meant- to be synced to the music and even if they try it is entirely out of sync with itself. This aspect demolishes the intended audio/visual experience which is the point of the entire game. It's very sad to consider how stunning Child of Eden was when it took advantage of the expanded memory, gpu, and peripherals it had available, and it goes to show how much potential has been squandered here. This would have been obvious if it had been properly play tested.\n\nTo add salt to the wound, Area X (the new VR part of the game made for Infinite) failed to work on my Quest 2. I couldn't target anything so I just couldn't play that at all (I hear it's basically just 1 extra 15 min level anyway). Truly disappointing in every way.\n- I didn't want to review this until I was completely done. I've now 100%'d the game. Quite simply, I think everyone should play this game! It's perfect for puzzle players with easy and difficult puzzles, most of which feel very satisfying to solve, has fantastic commentary about all of the perspectives of today's society (it's not just a one-sided view!) and is a genuinely well-crafted game.\n\nMost facets of the game are positive so I have to point out the negatives in the game.\n1: There is no save/load system, it's all automatic checkpoints and you have to go and back up the files manually if you want to see the results of different choices.\n2: The choices you can make, or miss, have some light dialog consequences but they occur over many hours of time. This is something I don't really expect from a puzzle game that used to always tell you \"you can return to any place you want at any time.\" In this game, you can't. The time of day and weather of locations can irrevocably change, the ending itself has some major changes, yet there's no way to see it all without replaying the game (a tough pill to swallow for a puzzle game) or watching the results on YouTube. I'm kinda against that sort of thing unless your game can be played multiple times and be different each time, which this won't be, because it's the same puzzles each time.\n3: The engine is Unreal 5 and it's very unfortunate. Although the game may have been easier to develop for multiple platforms in a faster time via doing this, but it has proven that Croteam's old Serious Engine was a much better engine. Unreal 5 has horrible eye adaptation, anti-aliasing, lighting, and geometry options that are all proven to be horrible via this game. Don't get me wrong, the game runs and looks fine for the most part, but all of it could look better and run better had it been built on any other engine. Yes, *any* other engine. I'd sooner have played this on the Source engine. Epic's Lumen and Nanite technology is still too unproven, early, and crappy to be the generational leap they claim to be. I hope the developer can better tune this stuff so players can have better framerates, less ghosting, better lighting, and eliminated distant object pop-in.\n4: The game's pace at the start and end are worse than they could be. The beginning spends too long (and a lot of later optional dialog depends on your exploration of this) in an open world without puzzles while the end has a final puzzle that includes a frustratingly tedious walk-about aspect that needed to be shortcutted somehow. Everything in between (including the breaks you get back in the open world bit) is perfectly crafted and paced, though.\n\nThese things said, I still insist that if you enjoy any form of puzzle game, like Antichamber or Portal, you play this game. You will enjoy it!\n- [b]HUGE DISCLAIMER[/b]\nThe Steam version of Titanfall 2 STILL REQUIRES ORIGIN. It has NO useful Steam integration whatsoever. It launches the game through Origin, and you can only invite friends through Origin. If you've already got Titanfall 2 on Origin, you may as well skip this. \n\nTHAT SAID\nTitanfall 2 is one of the greatest (if not [i]the[/i] greatest first person shooters of our generation. The game's four years old, I'm not sure I can say anything that hasn't been said before.  The story is short and sweet, and genuinely really really good. The multiplayer is the meat of this game, and it's fantastic. Movement is fast and fun, shooting feels great (I mean, these dudes made Modern Warfare, so), piloting a giant robot is sick as hell.\n\nI don't know what to tell you. If you play FPSs and you've never tried Titanfall 2, you owe it to yourself to buy this game.\n- I played the demo and instantly became enamored. The mix of Slay the Spire-style deck-building with elements of the ship combat from FTL: Faster Than Light is an absolutely fascinating mix, and the \"single-axis\" movement system adds a whole extra layer that I've never seen in anything except the Mega Man: Battle Network series.\n\nI bought the full game within the first hour of being available. After having played for nearly 4 hours at the time of writing, my opinion hasn't changed in the slightest. I already love what's available and so far I feel like I've barely scratched the surface.\n\nI can't wait to see what awaits in the future for this awesome title.\n\nEDIT: As a small addition, I will say: I beat my very first run, which is set to the lowest difficulty (Normal). I jumped up to Hard to try to unlock a new ship, and I haven't been able to beat a run since then. It's probably just that I'm bad, all things considered, but be aware that the changes made with difficulty increases are probably more impactful than they may seem.\n\nAlso I wanna say to the devs: thank you for launching the game with mod support and working on making it easier! But also please look into getting Steam Workshop support if you can!\n- cool game but the font is almost unreadable at times\n- They shadow dropped an update that literally breaks the game and DLC, and for what? Ads.... ads for RS+\n\nNo wonder piracy is the answer in this day and age when stupid business decisions like this are implemented. If I were to write a review a week ago I'd of said yes and recommended this, but this is just another shovel of dirt in the company's deep DEEEEEEEP hole of failures. I'm officially done with Ubisoft because of this. This was a great gateway to learning guitar and even the CDLC made it possible to learn songs that aren't even apart of the + library.\n\nSomeone please get to making a pirated copy of this game with all DLC as that will sell better than anything ubi throws out and it'll be free at that.\n- This is a really clever game; smart and witty dialog, hand drawn graphic-novel style art, and creatively written missions.  I've only played through one set of 7 day missions but there is definitely a desire to go back and try to win in other ways.  In this game you have to manage the resource of your superheroes - not just which ones you think will survive the mission uninjured but to find compatibility and relationships between the superheroes.  There are some contrived bits, some superhero style (groan) humor - but overall this game lets you feel the joy, awkwardness, and humanity of relationships.  I *really* cared about these characters and their trials.  Love is love is love. (Disclaimer - I know Jesse Schell personally, but I don't know the team and I don't feel that relationship influenced my review or appreciation of the game which stands on its own).\n- Ranking based on my \"clicking time\" is an odd designer's choice ... Is it a cheap way to add challenge? Apart from that, the game seems nice. Positive review for now, but it is kinda close call for me ...\n\nI admit, it is so fun to play, however, I have just completed 2 scenarios for the warrior and for the rogue and .. why is it so easy? Is the game goint to get any more difficult?\n\nI have just beaten summer campaign. Still absolutely no challenge. I am hoping for the fall and winter to get more challenging ... \n\nAfter playing for a while ... ranking based on time is the most horrible designers' choice I have seen in turn-based games. I see the point here thought, so WHY DON'T you do it based on NUMBER of turns instead? It makes sense and it would be fun to define decks for more effecient play ... time based, however, adds frustration instead of satisfaction. It doesn't feel like a challenge but rather (sorry for repeating myself) the cheapest way ever to pretend there is a challenge here ..\n\n\nAlso .. Tolerance\n[strike] Suffered 3 or less damage in combat. This achievements seems bugged ... I am fairly sure I have had fights where I suffered no damage at all .. [/strike]\n- Lots of people parrot the \"tech demo\" or \"benchmark of the singularity\" lines without forming their own opinions.\n\nMe personally, as a fan of Supreme Commander, I enjoyed this game more then I thought I would. I only played the single player campaigns and haven't touched multiplayer. \n\nThe gameplay is exactly what it should be for this kind of game. When I first saw this game I didn't like how every unit was a hovering unit, but it makes sense with the class system the game has. Frigates are basically infantry, Cruisers are tanks, Dreadnauts are hero/high tier. The game borrows from Dawn of War with the territory control mechanic.\n- It's a puzzle game about placing toppings onto donuts and delivering them to different areas on the boar. Great vibe and the first few hours are fun, but it gets incredibly repetitive even with the frequent introduction of new mechanics, especially so if you don't click with said mechanics particularly well. If it's on sale, give it a go - you very well might like it much more than I did.\n- theres 2 options with this game, either you play the original without mods wich is still a very good game\nor you have the untitled goose, matt from wii sports, sans undertale, and barack obama fight on top of a mcdonalds\n\n10/10 game\n- Digital Eclipse’s Making of Karateka is a fantastic interactive documentary giving a Criterion Collection quality exploration of a game as well as persevering it to allow people to play it. The collection focuses on Jordan Mechner’s early years in game dev up until the release of Karateka and its ports. The collection is structured in chapters chronologically with each chapter being comprised of timelines that showcase a smorgasbord of information dealing with Mechner’s early works and Karateka. This information includes content such as concept art, magazine articles, interactive viewers that allow you to see how the animation process of Karateka was designed, and present day interviews with people like Mechner, some of the old Broderbund crew who worked on Karateka, and game devs inspired by the game such as Tom Hall and John Tobias. The way this all is structured is really engaging. The interviews dealing with Mechner’s early years are especially charming as he and his dad reminisce how the whole family inspired and worked to help Jordan make Karateka like how his dad dressed up in a karate gi and essentially did the motion capture for the Karateka MC and how he composed the whole soundtrack. Making of Karateka also does a splendid job preserving not only Karateka and two of its most popular ports, but it also has playable prototype builds. It also has previously unreleased games Mechner made before Karateka complete with earlier design builds as well, one of them being Death Bounce, an Asteroids inspired space shooter. There’s just so much clear love and care put in this collection’s creation and it’s truly splendid to see, especially because video game history and preservation isn’t considered as a serious undertaking compared to older artistic mediums such as literature and film. Video games, being the youngest of the mediums, was born in the age of mass corporatization where being a product that sells is considered to be far more important than being of piece of artistic media that should be celebrated. Films managed to emerge right before rampant commercialization happened so they were still able to be considered art that needed to be preserved, but games haven’t been as lucky and tend to just be considered expendable products, especially by major publishers. It’s just so heartening to see something like this exist. I do have one problem when it comes to this whole package though, I think Karateka is just a straight up bad game. \n\nKarateka may have been a technical marvel at the time, as the documentary materials extensively shows, but it has completely aged like milk and is just not a good game to actually play anymore, especially in the present when a vast plethora of games have surpassed it in all regards. It’s slow, clunky, and repetitive, combat is just mainly spamming kick and moving and back forth, the hitbox on the eagle is an absolute pain in the ass, and running is super awkward and can lead to enemies’ one-shotting you if you don’t get into combat stance fast enough. There’s no lives or continues so you just gotta slog through all those boring fights and unskippable cutscenes all over again. I’m admittedly not a big fan of 80’s games, but I can pick up games like Super Mario Bros., Tetris, or Galaga and have fun with them and respect their quality, plus they’re still quite accessible. Karateka is just miserable, to the point I’m surprised people even liked it at the time. Like it’s kinda sad to me the most fun I had with Jordan Mechner’s older games in this collection was his blatant ripoff of Asteroids he made in high school. Similar to my thoughts on Night Dive’s remaster of Rise of the Triad this year, I feel Digital Eclipse gave a gold star treatment polishing to a turd, an influential one, but a turd nonetheless. Digital Eclipse also did their own remasters of Karateka and Death Bounce, they’re more playable but they still don’t really salvage the games at all to me. The Karateka remaster does add the option of giving yourselves extra lives and it does play a little better but it adds the leopard that got the cut from the original game and that section is just awful. The Death Bounce remaster is okay, though I feel the Rover is just kind of bullshit, though arcade space shooters ain’t really my forte.\n\nOverall Making of Karateka is a wonderful documentary and preservation package for a game that has unfortunately not stood the test of time at all. Regardless if you have any interest in video game history I whole-heartedly recommend it. Definitely looking forward to Digital Eclipse possibly making this an entire series and cover games that were influential and actually good, like Doom or Monkey Island. Man, I want a Doom one so bad…\n- + Great developer support.

Let this be a reminder to gamers that no matter how beloved your favorite game studio is, sooner or later they'll have a downfall. \n\nI've been a fan of Dying Light since the first game released in 2015. So it pains me to see one of my favorite series' fall like that with the introduction of microtransactions and garbage live service elements. \n\nThe story in DL2 is somehow worse than the original. While DL1's story was pretty generic, at least it wasn't crap. DL2's story is more generic and all of its characters are absolutely obnoxious (except for Hakon). I don't know why western devs and movie makers think writing obnoxious characters is good. Don't get me wrong, you can write an entertaining character who's obnoxious, but in DL2 they characters are just obnoxious, not entertaining. \n\nThe combat gameplay in DL2 feels off. When you swing your melee weapons sometimes they don't connect with zombies right in front of you when they should. And the gore seems broken. Even with the Gut Feeling update. The gore might look good but it doesn't feel like its actually tied to the combat. For example, you could drop kick a human enemy and somehow all of their hands and legs would rip off after hitting a wall which makes no sense. Somehow DL1's gore is more realistic. With DL2 being a Chinese game now I think the gore might get downgraded later on. \n\nI might be a minority on this one but I never really had any complaints about the parkour. I thought it was a definite improvement over the first game and with the Good Night, Good Luck update they improved it even further. I also don't mind the lack of guns in the game. DL was always focused on melee combat and the lack of guns makes the game more challenging whereas in DL1 nighttime became a joke as soon as you got a powerful shotgun where you could also buy ammo for very cheap instead of it being scarce like in Resident Evil. But being OP and shooting volatiles was still fun in its own way NGL. \n\nSpeaking of night, it's laughable how initially Techland completely nerfed the night time experience just to appeal to casuals. Instead of making the night scarier and more complex in DL2 for the millions of fans of DL1 they thought it was a good idea to appeal to people who dropped the game because they were scared of playing a HORROR game. I'm sure the devs had fun wasting their time reworking a core mechanic of the game months after the game was already out when they could've avoided this altogether if they didn't have the bright idea to remove roaming volatiles. But at least they added them back in and made it similar to how it worked in DL1 though it's not perfect yet. It's BS that volatiles NEED to be hit a certain amount of time before they die now. It feels like artificial difficulty. \n\nTo Techland's credit, they did add a community map creation feature which I think more devs should do for their games. Even if DLC2 sucks and Elyseum is never included in the game, fans can now make their own maps and modes and have fun. I hope they keep expanding on this feature. It's also nice that Techland actually listens to feedback and include requested features as soon as they can. They promised at least 5 years of support and before the buyout it really did seem possible. \n\nI really wanted to love Dying Light 2. And I still do to some extent. But the game fails to live up to the first game even over a year after its release. And after the buyout, I don't think this game will ever do. My hype for DLC2 is almost zero. But that's only because I know almost nothing about the DLC except leaks and rumors as Techland didn't announce anything. I really hope this won't affect the updates Techland makes to change the game for the better but at this point I'm not sure anymore.\n- The game died because the company could not support server costs and its a damn shame because it was a fucking blast.  Why this game died and Dungeon Defenders II lives is a mystery to me.  Please re-release the game with Peer to Peer networking and I will pay $$\n- Minesweeper influenced design feels like a fresh take on the Slay-the-Spire-like genre.  Now that I've won with all six classes, and done some of the unlockable difficulty levels, I feel that I've gotten my money's worth with the game, and I have enjoyed the time I've spent so far, but I don't expect great longevity beyond this point.\n\nI do have some minor gripes:\n\n* The pacing on unlocking new classes feels too slow.  It would be nice if the approach was the fairly standard one of unlocking a new class when you win with the previous one, but here there is a currency which is acquired throughout runs, and I found that I usually had to have two winning runs with the previous class to earn enough currency to unlock a new one.\n* Optimal play with some classes requires memorizing tiles which are revealed, and then on later turns these tiles are hidden.  Taking damage because I misremembered what was hidden behind a tile feels unfun and at-odds with what the game otherwise wants to be.\n* I would prefer if the harder difficulty settings were unlocked from the get-go, rather than grinding through easier difficulty settings to find the challenge.\n\nOtherwise, though, it's a fun game with an adorable art style, and not just a clone of the other Spire-likes around.  Recommended if your expectation is to get ten hours or so of strategic puzzling.\n- In life, failure is as inevitable as success – this is the underlying principle of great puzzle games. You're equipped with all the tools you need to succeed and it's your responsibility to utilize them effectively to achieve the goals set before you.\n\nHUMANITY places you in control of a luminous Shiba Inu, tasked with guiding hordes of people towards a light that transports them into the unknown. The game unfolds like a series of puzzle boxes, each with a fundamental set of rules: shepherd your humans to the light, prevent them from falling from great heights, and use the provided tools to avert their untimely demise. If navigating the crowds from point A to point B wasn't challenging enough, the game rewards your efforts to collect Goldys – the epitome of human accomplishment – which in turn unlock progress and assistive tools for easier puzzle-solving.\n\nInitially, the toolset is simple, with arrows for direction and commands to jump. These rudimentary tools soon amalgamate into a complex web of commands, making the gameplay increasingly intricate. It would be easy to liken HUMANITY to Lemmings, but doing so would disregard the platform challenges that uniquely define this game. As a player, you'll find yourself questioning how to access certain areas of a level to place commands and realizing that the stream of people you're guiding are also instrumental in your own journey.\n\nThe tranquil aesthetics of HUMANITY are a signature of the team behind Tetris Effect, Child of Eden, Lumines, and REZ. Coupled with the pseudo-futuristic techno music, these visuals create an immersive and cohesive experience, reminiscent of an interactive design studio’s portfolio. The game's sleek aesthetics provide a calming backdrop for the perplexing trials that await you.\n\nThe crafting of a good puzzle game demands talented designers capable of devising some of the most challenging levels. HUMANITY embraces this notion by enabling anyone to create and share their levels, ensuring a constant influx of new challenges from the community.\n\nFans of games like Portal, Baba is You, The Witness, or The Talos Principle will find HUMANITY an easy recommendation. As with those games, failure is not a dead end; instead, it forms part of the learning process propelling you towards success.\n\nHUMANITY is a true Goldy of puzzle games. Underneath its engaging gameplay, it communicates a deeper message – one that resonates with its players, and, much like its puzzles, equips you with enough tools to reach your own conclusions.\n\n- tax evasion\nmild aggression\nbullying vegetables\nfun soundtrack\namazing hats \n\ngameplay is amazing and enjoyable, not too short and not too long either with fun little secret things here and there\n10/10 I would play it again on a rainy day with some tea :)\n- Is Duskers a fun game? Yes. Would I recommend it? No, because of one simple reason:\n\nA lack of content with no mod support.\n\nDuskers is a little like No Man's Sky in the sense that the first few hours are filled with fun and wonder, but everything afterwards becomes a disappointment because the game turns out to be far more shallow than it initially seemed. As a player, I yearned to explore more of the randomly generated galaxy in Duskers because I wanted to see what other horrors, mods, and derelict types I would encounter in the empty universe - but in the end, it turned out that there was really very little else to see besides what you find in the first couple of hours. \n\nHere's a quick rundown of where the content was most lacking:\n\n--Enemy types: there's only 4 different enemies. FOUR. They also behave pretty much identically with the exception of the last one.  This was definitely the biggest interest-killer for me. \n\n--Derelict types end up mattering very little. Government A? Salvage C? Military B? It really doesn't change the layout in a particularly noticeable fashion, with the only differences being 1-2 extra ship defense turrets or something like that. \n\nI really, really wanted to give Duskers a thumbs up - I loved the aesthetic, I loved the atmosphere, and I loved the unique command line interface - but unfortunately, after a few hours, I came to realize that there's really just not enough actual content here, and that's heartbreaking for fans of this niche genre like myself.\n\n\n- Remember when you first played Thumper, and you were expecting a rhythm game but got so much more?\nOr when you played Thomas Was Alone, and you somehow fell in love with characters who were literally monochromatic rectangles?\nOr when you got to the final level of Journey, and you nearly cried of amazement at the emotional EXPLOSION AND RELEASE?\nAll those feelings? That is Sayonara Wild Hearts.\n- Nobody will read my review, so i'll just say i'm gay\n- i would say yes there are many bugs especially in the ne update where the cell doors remain open in normal mode and the guards take the new prisoners in the new cells and leave them there handcuffed forever. however this is one of the funnest games iv'e ever bought and it has brought me countless hours of enjoyment, the bugs might be annoying at times but mostly a good restart should do it :). overall i think this game is very worth getting, it lets you play the game how you want to play it and doing so will give you hours of fun as theres always something to do wether its create mor cells or make a execution room. and the mods are great you can really see the creativity in the prisons people have made i would definantly reccomend the checkpoint charlie military prion texture mod too.\n- An Excelent, well polished shmup(except for one technical fault) with great graphics and music.\n\nNot much to say other than it has fun boss fights with some creative bullet patterns, you have a gauge that fills up and when activated it doubles your fire power, and also you have bombs. If you have bombs and you get hit, you lose all of your bombs instead of just dying straight out, so you essentially have 2 hit points. You have a graze meter as well, meaning that if bullets pass by you it fills that meter up, when it is full, all bullets around you are basically nullified, and any enemy you kill, any bullets it fired at you will also get nullified. When you pass through the nullifeid bullets, it will fill the first gauge I mentioned so you can go ape s**t more often.\n\nIt's fairly simple, but the pace of the game takes a little while to get used to, the speed of your ship releative to the bullets is a little too slow but it's not game breaking. The only major issue is that my controller is not detectable by the game so I have to use joytokey, so I can't make full use of my controllers analog controls.\n- If you notice that Kagami voice sounds different, that’s because the guy who voiced him in the first game, Brad Venable, died at the beginning of last year. This time, Kagami is voiced by Austin Lee Mathews, who voiced Roche (Final Fantasy VII Remake) and Ash Carbide (Cold Steel III and IV). \n\nRest In Peace, Brad. We may forget Kaniza’s name, but we won’t forget yours. And thank you for being one of the funniest character in the game.\n- One of the best most fun and addicting all-time games. However, the plants should be nazi's and the zombies should be jews. There is also a hispanic snail in your garden that sleeps on the job.\n- An amazing game, you can go from doing great and having a full and maxed level crew, and end up fighting the wrong guy as they systematically destroy your ship systems leaving your weapons and shields off-line as your crew burns to death while suffocating. Very fun and has endless replayibility\n- Basic game, extremely well done. Like going home and eating your mom's food after decades on the road.\n\nEditing the review to mention some of the flaws of the game:\n- the level design in general is not that great, with every tiny room requiring some mindlessly easy puzzle to be solved first. Eventually it just feels like a chore.\n- not sure if it's something with my steam deck, but I had to put both the game's and the screen's brightness to the max to be able to see things; before that I was constantly missing objects and having trouble with moving around because some soil path looked like a hole in the ground or something.\n- while the game is 2d, there's a lot of different layers of height and depth that get mixed in together and may be hard to tell apart. You often don't know if some platform can be climbed onto or jumped out of until you try to do it.\n- battle system gets repetitive after a while.\n\nDespite those problems, the game is still great and more than make up for those things in other areas.\n- This is trash, I mean if you eat shit for breakfast I'm sure you'll like it.  You have to pay to have access to graphics better than the PS2's, also your stuff gets deleted every week. All there is to do is punch a couple zombies.  Don't get this game.\n- Really overrated. Sure the graphics are fancy schmancy, but in the end it feels more like a dumbed-down Left 4 Dead.\n\nPurely from a gameplay perspective, the class specializations are excessively numerous with not that many differences between many of them (and notably, every class can use the same weapons anyway), and the solo mode sucks (no bots, are you kidding me?).\n\nOn other aspects of the game, there is that XP and (cosmetic) items grinding that seems to be the current trend/cash cow. And the fucking ridiculous buying of weapons and ammo within missions because, you know, killing monsters gives you money and in a world completely wrecked by zombies there are automated weapon stores at every corner - seems legit. Feels like that CSGO crap: it's not an FPS as much as a trading \"game\", where you buy stuff ingame and you buy or sell stuff on the Steam marketplace.\n- Don't let the playtime fool you, I have hundreds of hours of this game on Epic, PS4 and Xbox. Here's the kicker: they actually use Neversoft's old handling code for this remake, so it's exactly as good as you remember it. THPS1+2 has snappy controls, great visuals, the works. Something to thoughtlessly get addicted to, time and time again. \n\nWe'll probably never see a THPS3+4, but cherish this remake, as it shows a great game with great care put into it. It's made by people who really really love the series, and it shows.\n\nGoogle \"THPS Pro\" to get the 3+4 levels into this as a mod, and keep on getting dunked by the pros in Online. The skill ceiling is high, but oh so worth it.\n- This game has (while this review is being written) 10076 reviews. 221 of these reviews are negative. I think this ratio of reviews is deserved and here's why:\n\n- It's a fun story, but not something outstandingly new or anything\n- No one ever can deny that it has an amazing soundtrack\n- The combat is a bit bland, but this is compensated by the fact that the game is pretty short\n- It's a short game, but definitely worth it\n\nOverall: it's just a fun short game to play on a day off. Also, I can't get this soundtrack out of my head! PLEASE SEND HELP!\n- If you want to play D&D but don't have friends, just get this game.\n- THIS REVIEW IS FOR VERSION 1.3 \n\nStarbound is the space game that all people who crave space games like I do will enjoy. \n\nFrom playing with your friends and colonizing an entire star sytem to role playing as a galactic bounty hunter, this game truly offers what all of us enjoy. \n\nPros \n+ Unique art style \n+ Infinite procedurally generated universe \n+ Creative alien races that are completely customizable \n+ Pets unique to each race \n+ A heart wrenching story that [Spoilers] makes you a hero \n+ Crafting system that requires a plethora of materials \n+ Mining and harvesting isn't a grind \n+ Materials can be acquired through pickaxes, drills, mechs, and the infamous and upgradable Matter Manipulator \n+ Devs constantly working to update and add new features \n+ Every planet is different with several contributing features such as weather, temperature, radiation, and colonization \n+ Many different generated structures such as buildings and towns that generate on some of the planets, with origins of each race \n+ An upgrading and advancement tree that takes time and effort that is always enjoyable. Exploration is necessary to advance upon it, is unique to each race, and customizable to each player \n+ Crew members can be added to your ship, but I'll say more later \n+ Your own space station can be created for players and NPCs to visit \n+ You can create and fully cutomize a mech to fly through space and stomp along the ground \n+ You can visit and trade inside of other space stations full of NPCs / other players \n+ You can create colonies for NPCs to live in \n+ Treasures can be discovered pretty much anywhere \n+ Tech can give you powers like dashing, jumping, and morphing into a ball \n+ The bosses get harder and are all quite cleverly created \n+ The quests link into the web of connections that advance your tech, systems, and story \n+ Moddable in any way you like, from the intro scene to Robbie Rotten's clothes \n+ Vehicles such as hover bikes and boats are available. \n+ Port forwarding isn't required to host games, your friends can join you through Steam at any time \n+ Tiny easter eggs and hints from the devs can be found throughout the game \n+ It's fairly cheap price-wise, I mean it's a fourth of No Man's Sky and four hundred times better \n+ The soundtrack is beautiful and has brought tears to my eyes more times than I'd like to admit \n+ So many possibilities that can lead to my 700 plus hours on this game \n\nNeutralities \n~ The universe doesn't feel losslessly empty and gigantic, it's fairly easy to get from star to star \n~ Life is extremely abundant \n~ 2D and pixelated; the graphics aren't 'next gen' \n\nCons \n- You can't customize the exterior of your ship \n- Crew members are a little dumb AI-wise and not extremely useful \n- It's a bit slow paced, which a lot people don't like [strike] because they all are stupid and get bored way too fast and don't have the drive to actually work for anything [/strike] but I love it. \n\nTL;DR \n* It's a great space exporation game with a web of slow-ish paced advancement that's extremeley wide in possibilites and customization.\n* Much of the game is unique, including the races, planets, stars, and generated structures. \n* If you don't like it, you probably don't like space games :p\n- One of the best platformer/Beat-them-up just got upgraded. new attacks, new enemies, new bosses, new levels, new modes, new skins and a graphical improvement, this is really worth getting if you didn't play the original version. if you have the original you get a 66% discount which is good but i still think it should be an optional DLC that sells for 2 Dollars. of course i understand many people won't buy it because they played the original and they shouldn't buy it, but as for me its just that i wanted a reason to replay Guacamelee again so i bought this.\n- WARNING. This game is pure drug. Don't buy unless You have no kids, no wife and You have a lot free time. I mean thousands of hours.\n\nYour brain will turn into a machine calculating the optimal use of all available resources on the map, there are hundreds of them and each discovery brings new threats from the beautiful mother nature. At some point You may experience unexpected dreams about high tech and well tuned factories.\n\nEarly Access in this case means something similar to never ending story. When You think \"I have done everything\" new update shows up and You're starting doing mess again.\n\nI can only have reservations about the multiplayer mode, where there are funny glitches, disappearing objects, self-propelled vehicles, lack of character synchronization, etc. However, this does not prevent having continuous fun in the co-op mode.\n\nI hope You like it so much as I did.\n\nEDIT: Still thinking of buying it? Don't think, just do it. U8 changed a lot, it's now Unreal Engine 5 with Lumen effects, devs are pushing forward to get final product release. Join the party!\n- It's more of a mixed recommendation but the positives outweigh the negatives if you're a returning fan.\n\nEverything in the game that's an adaptation of the original FF7, I love.  It gave me major nostalgia vibes to walk through a gorgeously rendered versions of FF7's environments.  The combat is much more engaging - no more watching a tv show on the side while I button-mash another random encounter.  Many of the big story moments still hit and I found even more to love in the characters based on their performances going beyond text boxes and blocky animations.  Even the music is just top-notch.  The OST will be a mainstay in my playlist for years.  It feels like I'm seeing the old game with fresh eyes and remembering why it made such an impact.\n\nThat said, the new content feels like a filler arc in a beloved anime.  Your character falls into a random hole like 3-4 times, spends 2 hours fighting random baddies, and then walks out like \"right, so back to that thing I was doing.\"  I don't even know if a new player could understand wtf is happening with Sephiroth because he's never really introduced and certain essential events are never explained.  It tries to take some clever left-turns on the plot so returning players have new surprises to enjoy but it often feels pretentious and pointless.  The ending gave me flashbacks to Peter Jackson's Hobbit trilogy because of how unnecessarily forced it was and the sudden cartoon levels of action.\n\nI'm tentatively enthusiastic for the sequel but there's a few troubling signs I hope don't become a trend.\n- I keep seeing all these negative reviews comparing the game to Dark souls, so i'd like to set this straight:\n\nThis. Game. Isn't. Dark. Souls.\n\nIf you play this game like you would a dark souls game you would not have any fun, I know this because I spent the first 30 hours playing it like a Dark souls game and wasn't enjoying it.\nIn order to play this game how it is supposed to be played you need to start investing more in learning combos for your character, different techniques and items to use.  Each weapon has a unique set of combos you can invest in.  When you learn how to use these combos, you'll find that enemies who were infuriating to fight against being defeated much easier and the game becomes more challenging and fun over frustrating.\n\nSummery: This game isn't Dark Souls, So stop playing it like it is Dark souls!\nHighly recommend! \n\n\n\n- This is more than a game for me.  It has become a hobby.  What started as a random purchase for myself last Christmas -- I had an old electric guitar I never played in the closet, so this gave me an excuse to see if I can learn -- has become an expensive obsession for me.  Warning -- but a good warning -- you'll find that you're learning guitar very quickly on this game, and it will become the start of an expensive habit!  I have downloaded hundreds of dollars worth of songs, bought a brand new guitar, I've signed up for music theory and guitar lessons at the local county college ... this has become a genuine hobby for me.  Literally, it is one of those rare games which has genuinely made an impact on my life.  Six months later, and the game has not gotten old.  I look forward to new songs, I laugh when a new chord I've never seen magically appears on the song that I've practiced the hell out and achieved a new difficulty.  The game is, most importantly, fun.  It remains fresh and only gets better as you get better.  I highly recommend.\n- Was a bit turn off when I saw it was a stationary shooter, but the game is so fun I look past that and even began to enjoy the room scaling dodging mechanics (game can make you work up a sweat!).\n\nA must for anyone looking for a more intense arcade shooting experience. I cannot overstate how fun it is to build your weapons in VR, the crafting system works flawlessly and seemely without the need of menus or UIs getting in the way, props for the devs for how well the game integrates with VR controls.\n\nWhat I liked:\n- Varied enemies\n - Great VR controls\n- Gun crafting is addicting and allows for a lot of experimentation\n- Great Bosses\n\nWhat I had trouble with:\n- Makes you wish you could run around the rooms like the original game!\n- The reduced FOV of most VR headsets makes it quite difficult to keep track of enemies that come from multiple directions. Some rooms require so much head movement that I tend to get sick.\n- When a room spawns with multiple shield pylons and a healer bot, it gets extremely frustrating if you have slow moving projectile weapons.\n\nWishes:\n- More gun parts! (Maybe future DLC?)\n- You finally don't need a guide on how to purchase the game.\n\n- 21 different story missions that each take approximately 20 to 50 minutes to complete.\n- DLC sidestory contracts - different targets but same maps.\n- Escalation contracts on those same maps; think of this as a puzzle mode.\n- The new roguelike Freelancer mode that gives randomly generated targets in a randomly generated campaign.\n\nThis game now has such a vast wealth of content that it would take you months to complete it all. I genuinely recommend it.\n- Excellent game, but has an awful-abrupt ending that comes out of nowhere and doesnt make sense and leaves way too many plot elements unexplained.\n\nIn the last game they introduce a secret society of energy sucking vampires that are hunting Rosa and Joey yet they are never mentioned again and instead the end of series villian is some random messed up ghost that randomly has end of the world magic powers.\n\nAwful.\n- Civ 5, Heroes of Might and Magic had a baby together and that baby grew up and had a baby with Endless Space and this baby has now grown up and it is glorious in every level.\n\nIncredibly polished, incredibly neat, incredibly addictive and a game that stands out from the rest. If you like Empire-builders, this game is for you!\n\nIgnore the \"Early access\". This game is ready to be sold. I have only experienced one single bug in this game and the MP works like a clockwork. It's highly optimised, full of features and pretty to look at. I wish more Devs would make their games this way, it warms my heart!\n- Cthulhu Saves Christmas is another solid, fast-paced comedy jrpg from the folks at Zephoyd games. If you're looking for something bite sized, with some funny dialogue (most of it lands) and great combat this is a worthy purchase. I'd estimate an average playtime of 5-8 hours which is a perfect investment for a weekend jrpg.\n\nTLDR: If you enjoyed Cthulhu Saves the World and Cosmic Star Heroine, you're probably going to enjoy this game.\n\n【グループB】\n- Pros \nReally good voice ending.\nCreepy and you are unsure of everything which makes this more interesting.\nDecent story\n\nCons\nEnding just fucks up everything.\n\n\n\"I don't want Pewdiepie making money off my game.\" Im sure you made more money off Pewdiepie for advertising this shi*ty game lol.\n- it's a shame but i honestly cannot recommend this game if you are a disabled person, i wasn't that far into the game when my character started panicking apon seeing a disabled person [person with leg braces] and then gets a \"no good answer\" bit of dialog and all the options are saying something wrong or saying nothing, trying to go with the least bad option aside from saying nothing since i know as a disabled person myself [i'm a wheelchair user] it can be pretty upsetting getting people just randomly stare at me and at least when they say something slightly wrong they are engaging with me as a person, my character then proceeds to talk abt what an \"inspiration\" it is 2 c a disabled person living their life,,, not exaggerating when i say i let my head hit the desk, closed the game and uninstalled, i understand that this is probably put in the game to be a teachable moment for the able bodied audience but ironically in trying to educate about us disabled people they then made the assumption that no disabled people would be playing their game as there is no option to make your character disabled or even to make them remotely aware of disability and ended up just making the experience awful for the disabled gamers they seem to be trying to help\n- [h1]A Great Time [i]Killer[/i][/h1]\n\nSlayaway Camp is an enjoyable puzzle game that runs great and is well polished.  It's intellectually stimulating, humorous, and fun with just a sprinkle of nostalgia.  \n\nThe difficulty curve is perfect.  It is very clear the entire game was well thought out, planned, and implemented.  Kudos!\n\n[h1]System Info & Performance Report[/h1]\n[table]\n   [tr]\n        [td]Operating System[/td]\n        [td]Ubuntu Linux 14.04 x64[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]CPU[/td]\n        [td]AMD FX-8350[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]GPU[/td]\n        [td]GTX 750[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Technical Notes[/td]\n        [td]No crashes[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n- I was a playtester on this game, and I can say with authority, love and joy and care all radiate out of the work that was put into making this game. It still has the same Psychonauts wackiness and great comedy, but it's also become more mature, more understanding, more willing to tackle dark topics head on and acknowledge that human beings are flawed, and need help, and make mistakes, and sometimes even do awful things. But Psychonauts 2 understands that human beings aren't defined by any of this, and that people can learn from their wrongs and can change for the better. And it tells all this through a delicious array of gorgeous, varied mental landscapes, through creative collectibles that reveal the memories, loves, and regrets of the colorful cast, and through a combat and platforming system that is much improved from its predecessor. I can't recommend this game enough. It's an emotional triumph.\n- I'm going to write an honest review for this game since A LOT of people seem to be very biased.\n\nThis is not a perfect game. No 2K basketball game will ever be a perfect game. Does that mean this game is bad? No. Should you hold off on the game for now? Probably.\n\nLet's start with the positives:\n\n- A lot of people seem to gloss over the fact that 2K rehauled a lot of mechanics for this game. Shot meters feel more legitimate, this game is MUCH much more realistic (fouls, shot tendencies, etc...) This game is better and more fluid to control, and the gameplay reflects each players' ratings (defense, shots, etc...) much more accurately.\n\n- Online play seems to be better and more fluid. I've yet to encounter any latency issues online with quick play and the such.\n\n- MyCareer is MUCH better than last years. There is no cheesy story and the cutscenes feel much more integrated into the game. Orange Juice and dynamic duos are a great idea in general. The UI for MyCareer (and the game in general) is so much cleaner and more functional.\n\n- The game is visually beautiful, not much else to say on the matter.\n\nNow, the cons:\n\n- Help defense is broken. It's quite ridiculous that 2K hasn't fixes this lingering issue in such a long time but it's still there. This is a BIG issue in MyCareer and not quite as bad in other modes since you can manually control players.\n\n- Stat allocation is broken. This is a huge issue in MyCareer and has deterred me from playing the mode any more until 2K fixes this issue. Introducing the idea of stats that can only be raised in practice is actually quite a neat idea. However, these boosts are not permanent, even though 2K has stated they are. This is detrimental and demoralizing and discourages players from playing the game more. Limit caps are ridiculously strict as well. 2K NEEDS to fix these issues ASAP.\n\n- Numerous glitches.\n\n- 2K introduced broken mechanics along with the good mechanics. Ankle breakers are now pathetically easy to pull off (using Stephen Curry behind the back moves is a surefire way to have your defender fall). Moving screens are now a thing. \n\nI would hold off on buying this game until 2K patches it. There are just too many issues with the game that prevent it from being a playable game. I like this game. I really do. That's why I'm hoping 2K listens to the community and starts working on the issues at hand immediately.\n- Okay so,\n\nFirst off, the Streaming of the game play yesterday did this title zero favours. Whoever made the decision to allow a copy of the game which was 400 builds behind to be live streamed made a mistake.\n\nThe character creation is a nice touch, makes you think and get involved with it characteristics of the nation you pick to play as. I like this and rarely see stuff like this in game.\n\nThe Steam page states 'SuperPower 3 is tailor-made for all the megalomaniacs out there who are convinced they can do a much better job at running the world than real politicians and military leaders across the globe'. That's a rather bold statement for a game that has 5 or 6 laws you can change for a whole country...., \n\nOverall the game in its current state is incredibly basic and lacks any depth in regards to the actual management and running of a country. No parliaments behind a leader etc, why? Even the excuse of the focus is around you and your characters decisions doesn't make much sense. It takes away the feeling of running a country, that which you are describing in the games description. Where are the ministers, the scandals that come with the running of a country?\n\nThe game isn't a write off, I personally feel it will be good in time but looks to be missing alot. Overall 5/10. Product refunded.\n- Wow. Just wow. This is BY FAR the best visual novel i have played. the old school forums and cameras feel very detailed as whenever anything happens in a video chat, no matter how small, the characters react to it. the story was very enthralling and every time i slipped up and made a wrong move, my heart would feel as though it was gonna beat out of my chest. talking to violet felt very real and made the ending that i got so much more satisfying. the only bad things i can even say about this absolute masterpiece is just the fact that most of the really impact full options were locked because \"Emmett isn't cocky enough\" or  \"Emmett isn't compassionate enough\" which felt very vague and confining.\n\noverall the game is absolutely amazing and i wish the devs would come out with a game similar to this because of how good it was.\n9/10\n- I'm a bit torn on giving Guacamelee! Super Turbo Championship Edition (STCE) a thumbs down, but I feel it's important for prospective buyers/players to know that STCE is significantly worse than Guacamelee! Gold Edition. \n\nSTCE brings a number of modifications to Guacamelee, all of which are negative (apart from the 4P support). First, there are two large new areas, both of which serve as filler, breaking the flow of the game while not introducing any new concepts. Arguably the best part of the second area is the new character that serves as a boss, but said boss fight is relatively simple and the character takes focus away from the stronger original cast. Secondly are the combat changes: the \"rebalancing\" of enemies and the Intenso power. Javiar Jaguar, the stand-out boss from the original game, has been nerfed to an absolute pushover. Moreover, the Intenso power is absolutely game breaking, making every combat encounter in the game a joke. That wouldn't be so bad if you could ignore it, but the developers added certain combat encounters where the difficulty goes through the roof if Intenso isn't used (rooms with multiple enemies with white shields, hitstun-immunity, and/or non-dodgable attacks).  These rooms generally feature Intenso-refilling barrels or enemies as well, so the intention is clear. Of course, there's plenty of Intenso to go around even for easier rooms and bosses, trivializing combat entirely. \n\nIn short, STCE is still a good game, but the original release was a GREAT game, without the broken combat \"rebalancing\" and padding. Please buy/play Guacamelee! Gold instead.\n- I have a serious love/hate relationship with Sea of Thieves. It is both one of the best games I have ever played and one of the most frustrating games I have ever played, all wrapped into one. The gameplay of Sea of Thieves is INCREDIBLE. The sailing is the best in any game I have ever played. The feeling of exploration and discovery as you blast through treasure hunts and puzzles and mysteries is unlike any feeling you can get from any other game. The cooking mechanic, the healing from food, the not-terrible fishing mechanic... all subsystems that prop up the rest of the gameplay are unique and interesting in their own right. The land-based combat is relatively uninspired, yet still satisfying when part of the greater picture that the game presents. Some of my favorite memories in gaming, full stop, come from completing long nights on the high seas or doing long-form content available in the game. The game is gorgeous, some of the best ocean/water graphics in any game. The rest of the game is equally beautiful while perfectly conveying the environment of the map you are in. I swear to Gaben that I can freaking smell the wet sand or sulfurous lava on some of these islands. The music and sound design are some of the best in the industry. Outright, the game is incredible. \n\nBUT... Sea of Thieves sweaties ruin the game for me. There is absolutely nothing worse than having a night full of fun absolutely destroyed by some player who's enjoyment of the game is derived from eliminating anyone else's fun. I understand that PvP is part of the \"pirate life\", but it is by far the worst part of the game by far. I would be willing to pay money, hell a freaking monthly subscription, for the opportunity to play SoT as a strictly PvE game with just my friends and the rest of the server populated by bots. I actively avoid playing the game now because of how many of my last play sessions started with me spawning at an outpost and subsequently being sunk less than 15 feet off the dock by some sweaty that hasn't seen sunlight since the Obama administration. I know that this is an incredibly unpopular opinion in the greater SoT-sphere, but part of the enjoyment of games is letting players enjoy them how they wish, and I really freaking wish that I could enjoy the aspects of SoT that are fun to me without being the plaything of those pirates who live only to ruin the fun of others.\n- Intel Core 2 Quad @2.66GHz\n8GB Memory\nWin 7 64 bit.\nGeforce GTX 680 (X2) SLI\n\nMy CPU is pretty far under minimum requirements, but the game still loads up. The tutorial was releatively lag free. Once I got out in the open, however, the lag was incredibly noticeable. I'm sure I can \"play the game\", everything looks great, but it's clear to me I will be doing everything in slow motion.  Reading other reviewers who have specs above minimum, others are having lag issues as well. I'm hoping it's just a universal patch needed or a new driver update. Either way, I dont regret the purchas. I can still finish the game, it will just take a good buddy or two to hold my hand through the intense stuff...and to revive me.\n- The best war strategy game,, \nI hope in the future they make the similar game (COH3)\nwith modern armies and tanks and modern equipment..\nThey can make USA, British, German, France in one side,,\nand make Russia, China, Iran, and Turkey in another side.\n\nCOH2 Rating Analysis:\nGraphics: 9/10\nGunfires and Explosion: 8/10\nDynamic Weather Effect: 9/10\nAI: 9/10\nUnits and Vehicles: 7/10\n- 5 game difficultys Easy Normal Nemesis Gravewalker Brutal... so whitch one im supposed to play for it to be like the first game(which dident have a difficulkty, jst like awesome games like Gta 4 and assassins creed)???

Like everyone else im experiencing stuttering and the 30 frame rate cap but that is where my cons end. I dont have any special pc rig by any means yet even still i am enjoying this game SO MUCH. The story is so captivating i cant believe it, and the combat system? THE COMBAT SYSTEM IS SO FRICKING AMAZING I CANT BELIEVE IT. I HAVE NEVER FELT MORE LIKE BATMAN THAN I HAVE WHILE PLAYING THIS GAME. I ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE CONSIDERING BUYING THIS GAME AND DO YOU KNOW WHY. BECAUSE YOU'RE BATMAN. THE COMBAT SYSTEM IS INCREDIBLE. THE FLUIDITY OF ALL CONTROLS, INCREDIBLE. AND THE STORY? YEP, YOU GUESSED IT, INCREDIBLE. I CAN'T THANK ROCKSTEADY ENOUGH FOR MAKING THIS MASTERPIECE OF A GAME, IT IS SO ******* AMAZING I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n- I've been waiting since the likes of Planescape Torment and Baldurs Gate 2 for a game to match their sheer perfection, many games came quite close, but Divinity Original Sin just manages to hit so many nails on the head its not funny. It looks great and still plays fine on my aging PC, it has a great storyline, it's two protagonists have some great interactions and dialogue. The voice acting is spot on and it has the most sublime OST.\n\nThe combat is turn-based but do not let this put you off, there are so many choices in combat with the interaction of spells with each other and the environment, that the game just begs you to experiment with different tactics.\n\nThis game just oozes pure class, it was a labour of love for Larian and it shows in every tiny detail of the game.\nIf you like RPG games (or even just pure quality games), you need to play this game, it is the benchmark I will use in comparing other games in future.\n\nWell done Larian.\n- It's a real shame that one of the better games of 2015 was originally released in 1999 and 2003, respectively. \n\nHomeworld Remastered is beautiful. The music and voice acting is still spot on. I found myself re-living all of the excitement and wonder of the original release. \n\nThe only thing missing is the exclusion of Cataclysm (which in my opinion is the better of the three games). Let's hope that Gearbox can find the missing(?) source code for Cataclysm and give us the missing chapter of the saga. \n\nIf you like Real-Time Strategy, well crafted stories and truly challenging gameplay (your tank rush will NOT work here for every mission, you're going to have to really think about what you build, capture or destroy), this blast from the past will sate that hunger. I couldn't recommend this game any higher.\n- Unfortunately Flatout 3 is a big disapointment for me and many fans of previous parts. \nWhat went wrong? \nGameplay has lost this \"catchy\" spirit making this game addicting. Controls has changed and physics as well. You don't have any feeling of the vehicle You driving. The game seems to be at faster pace. Too fast form me :) Too many explosions and destructions out of a good taste. Soundtrack is flat and colorless. It isn't bad but... There is no tracks of some famous rockbands as previously. Graphisc has not made any progress. It has made a step backwards as it stay in place.\n Flatout3 has a lot of game modes some of which are not playable at all. \n\nI like SPEED Mode it has something good :)\n\nThe rest is kind of fun ... for about 5 minutes. There is no career mode :(\n\nTo be honest : Flatout 1 & 2 have their own style and leave in gamers' minds an unique impresion and lots of good, warm memories. FO3 does not...\n- HOW?? WHY?? WHY IS THIS GAME SO GOOD?? IT HAS NO REASON TO BE THIS GOOD WTF?\nThe trailers or advertisements will not even give anything close to a sense on how good this story, build up, characters and mechanics (did I mention the story?) really is.\n\nShu Takumi and Yasumasa Kitagawa, you've done it again, from Ace Attorney to this. I can 100% say if you haven't played this game, you are definitely missing out.\n\n10/10!!!\n- Before I continue writing my review on this game, I got to say that the PC port of Valkyria Chronicles is one of the best, if not, [u]the[/u] best port. The game was originally exclusive for the PlayStation 3 back in 2008. The game was well received, but garnered low sales that would put the sequels Valkyria Chronicles 2 and 3 on the PSP. I actually never heard of this game before until a few week prior to the PC release on November 2014. That said, I will have to give a standing ovation to Sega for putting an effort to make the PC port well optimized in 1080p (or more) at 60 FPS (or more). Sega has my attention and I will present this review.\n \nValkyria Chronicles focuses on Welkin Gunther, a son of a legendary general who fought in the First Europan War, leads a platoon of some adults and teenage volunteers to defend their country against the invading forces of the Imperial Alliance. The game presents a mix of tactical strategy and third-person action that is very unique in the strategy game genre. Does this game deserve your attention? \n\nThe story takes place in a “fictional” European continent where the Second Europan War was fought primarily between the Atlantic Federation (think of all of the European countries, in a geographical sense) versus the Imperial Alliance (Russia, in a geographic sense). Gallia is a “neutral” country where it contains a unique resource known as Ragnite. Thus, the Imperial Alliance invade Gallia to get Ragnite to fuel up their war resources. One of the greatest parts about the game is how well the developers use analogies from World War II into the game and its execution is well-received. The analogies ranged from weapon designs (like the Gallian Scout weapons that look like the Soviet SVT-40 to the Imperial weaponry comparison to the real-life MP40 and STG44, and plenty others). The analogy extends to vehicles and geopolitical conflicts. \n\nThe character developments in the game are highly impressive, particularly with the relationship between Welkin (protagonist) and Alicia Melchiott (deuteragonist). The themes in Valkyria Chronicles consist a good mix of “light” moments (like hope as an example) and “semi-grotesque” themes of war (such as discrimination/racism, personal ambition over soldiers’ lives, and others themes that will unravel later on). Some reviewers criticized the game as being not serious on the themes about war. Honestly, I don’t think that the game is supposed to be depressing and a good mix between “light” and “dark” is best suited for the game. The story starts really slow in the beginning and actually begin to progress as you reach a certain point in the story. The plot is pretty good in most area while few scenes are a bit “awkward” in terms of sudden shifts between a sad event to a “positive motivation”. \n\nThe gameplay in Valkyria Chronicles is turn-based, but it is very unique because once you click on a character to choose, you can actually control the character to move to any location in third-person you like as long you have enough Action Points (basically, the movement bar). Experience points and money are earned by Ranks (like A, B, C, and D) by completing an objective within a certain number of turns (Example: Getting a ‘A’ rank within 3 turns or less to get the maximum amount of exp and money). However, it is possible that you can actually kill all of the enemies on the map, complete the objective, and still get an ‘A’ rank in the majority of missions (except for a few of them). \n\nWith the exp and money, you train your soldiers based on classes Scout, Shocktrooper, Lancer (Anti-Tank/Explosives), Engineers, and Sniper rather than individuals. The money are used up to upgrade weapons, buy tank parts, and purchasing “reports” from a reporter in certain chapters in the story. The game would last you a good 30-50 hours if you play the game in a smart, tactical manner or have an “OCD” on getting an “A” rank on every single mission in the story or a mix of both (like I did). \n\nThe game does have some faults, particularly when it comes to classes. Reviewers argued that Scouts are too overpowered, but in my view, it is best to say that scouts are too reliable since they have the most movement bar and top-tier weapons like the ZM Kar 8 (the game's version of Soviet PTRS-41 that can obliterate any enemy, even medium and heavy tanks if you shoot it in the back). Engineers are useless in the game since you won’t repair your tank very often (depending on your play style) and Scouts are the better alternative. There are some bugs in the game that is related to the monitor refresh rate (if you play it on a 144 Hz monitor like I did) in certain missions in the story. PC controls are a bit awkward when you control the tank. There are a few moments in the story that has some poor “transitions” (an example would be that an upsetting moment happened in the story and all of a sudden, some of the major characters wanted a medal for their part on a major battle in the next cutscene as if that upsetting moment never happen or affected them). \n\nThe game is often compared to XCOM when it comes to gameplay. This may be true, but Valkyria Chronicles is very unique since you can actually control the character in third person instead of the computer doing it for you when you command the character to move from Point A to B, in bird’s eye view. The game engine is very aesthetic and presents the story very well. I’m glad the Sega released Valkyria Chronicles to the PC and I am very pleased to hear that a (possible) new Valkyria Chronicles game is being trademarked (and hopefully in development) thanks to the PC sales. The default price of $20 is a good deal, -50% off is a great deal, -75% is a perfect steal. Valkyria Chronicles is one of my top games for 2014 due to its unique strategy gameplay and superb PC port optimization. I am looking forward for the new game that is being trademarked (or possible PC ports or revamp for VC2 and 3). This game has my highest recommendation for any strategy gamer who want to find something original, unique, and beautiful.\n- This is a story about relationships.\nThis is a story about opposites.\nThis is a story about reflections.\nThis is a story about redemption.\nThis is a story about damnation.\nThis is a story about reconciliation.\nThis is a story about gods.\nThis is a story about paradoxes.\nThis is a story about love.\nThis is a story about hate.\nThis is a story about life.\nThis is a story about death.\nThis is a story about forgiveness.\nThis is a story about condemnation.\nThis is a story about time and time loops.\nThis is a story about multiverse theory.\nThis is a story about murder.\nThis is a story about betrayal.\nThis is a story about trust.\nThis is a story about freedom.\nThis is a story about happiness.\nThis is a story about sadness.\nThis is a story about boredom.\nThis is a story about a Princess.\nThis is a story about what looks like a Frog at one point.\n\nThis is a story about everything and nothing.

I don’t know if the dev has clarified on this, but it’s my interpretation of the protagonist anyway. \n    • Creative game mechanics. The player erases entire scenes away or journal entries, then later, can write (choose where written words appear).\n    • Extremely stylized. It’s simple art, but the presentation and coloration of it makes it very unique. \n    • Lots of Irish terms and slang to learn. There’s even a glossary. There’s also an amusing achievement for playing the game in Irish. \n    • Speaking of languages, there are 12 languages available for the game!\n    • Encourages people to seek out help from those who are willing to give it. \n\n[u]Complaints[/u]\n    • “Making Memories Disappear” achievement.

[spoiler]Her mother does eventually stop being a b*tch.[/spoiler] All queers deserve happy endings.\nI absolutely recommend this awesome interactive story-rich game to all the queers of the world.\n- This is such a great game. It's a well put together survival game with many things to do. Whether you want to just build a sandbox wilderness empire or try to escape, it's entirely fun no matter what. I've tried to actually complete the game, but I always end up building a massive epic fortress complete with my very own beefalo farm. The only thing that I personally don't like about this game is the stumble-upon style of actually completing the quests (they're not really quests, but I can't think of anything else to call them). Other than that, this game is a beautiful masterpiece. Very artistic, creative and fun. I definitely recommend it to anyone who loves survival games of any sort.\n- PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE VENTURING INTO 999!\n\n\n\nI refunded the game thinking they removed so much of the narrative but I was wrong, the game has now 2 different types of screens, the \"ADV screen\" and the \"Novel screen\". Make sure you switch to \"Novel screen\" as soon as you start playing and stay on that screen as the \"ADV screen\" only displays dialogue and NOTHING ELSE, if you stay on this screen you'll miss all the extra bits that can help to figure out certain details that allow you to find all the endings and figure out the entire story top to bottom.\nHappy gaming.\n\nEDIT: @Snivader pointed out my mistake, edited the review.\n\n\n\nExtra small tip to help you through your journey. Take a notepad (or anything you can scribble down onto), and write down key dates / codes / people that you encounter through the game and keep them close while playing the entire trilogy. I can guarantee you that your mind will be blown by the end of the trilogy (provided you can keep up with the weird events that go down in these games).\n- I came across Dreamscaper after playing 200 hours of Hades. I was looking for similar games that could recapture some of the magic of discovery and progression that made Hades such a delightful experience.\n\nDreamscaper is not Hades. There probably isn't any game that can measure up to the experience of playing Hades, and there probably won't be for a long while. But a lot of the same elements are there, and I did really enjoy Dreamscaper for what it was.\n\nThe \"story\" in Dreamscaper is more of a personal journey. There aren't really \"events occurring\" so much as a character working through her issues. The supporting characters are fairly interesting, though not quite on par with the literally larger-than-life dynamic personalities of Hades. But to be fair, the characters in Dreamscaper are ordinary folks, not mythological deities.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the game is \"nostalgic.\" It's an exploration of the protagonist's childhood memories, so that makes sense. There is a very different energy here than Hades' cheeky and horny angst. It's more sad and calm.\n\nIn terms of the feel of playing the game, Dreamscaper has a lot of similarities to Hades. There is a varied arsenal of different weapons and abilities, progression through randomized levels with boss fights, a wide selection of permanent character upgrades to purchase using resources gathered during runs, a relationship system to grow closer with the characters, etc. Unlike Hades, every aspect of your loadout can change throughout a run: you can swap out weapons and abilities as you encounter new and better ones along the way. It's both more flexible than Hades and less; you're not locked in to one weapon for the entire run, and there are many more weapons and abilities (and combinations thereof); but with more randomness comes less control, so it's a lot harder to craft and hone a particular build in Dreamscaper than in Hades. A lot of the \"builds\" are elemental damage modifiers, in which all you're trying to do is find a bunch of gear that (say) deals Lightning damage or increases your Lightning damage dealt. The upgrades are largely \"number get bigger,\" and while it can be satisfying to get a bunch of cool multipliers, it does feel less \"combo\"y or \"breakable\" than Hades (though there are certainly some very powerful and broken-feeling builds you can end up with).\n\nThe gameplay is challenging, like Hades, though perhaps slightly less. Like Hades, a lot of your ability to clear rooms and defeat bosses effectively comes from learning their attack patterns and timings. I do wish there were more variety to the enemies, as many of them are just \"the guy from the last level but he is stronger and has more abilities now\" (though that criticism applies to Hades as well). The boss fights are by and large much easier once you learn their patterns, though there are still a few that can be tough for certain builds. The \"hard version\" of bosses are definitely a force to be reckoned with, though.\n\nThe art and music are attractive and inviting. It's much more The Sims than Guilty Gear, but in a way that fits the atmosphere nicely. It's stylized in a very different way than Hades, but it works in its own way.\n\nThe developers are also very community-oriented and are responsive to community input through their Discord. The Hades developers probably are too, but I have no direct experience interacting with them.\n\nSo in conclusion, if you liked Hades because of its horny angst, badass metal riffs, mythological themes, and bloody humor, you may not have much interest in Dreamscaper. But if you liked Hades because of its randomized runs, variety of weapons and builds, feeling of progression, challenging boss fights, and dynamic cast of characters with complicated relationships, then you should absolutely pick up Dreamscaper. And if you didn't like Hades, then you probably stopped reading this review after the first paragraph.\n- I like this game because it is so relaxing. It has a great mix of monsters in it. You are not frighting monsters  all the time. I give this game a 5 star rating. I wish thee was a Dragon Quest Builder;s 3.\n- Dave the Diver is a charming little 'Indie'* that still surprises you with new mechanics even hours in. The various activity cutscenes are pretty funny as well.\n\nJust a word of warning though. Mintrocket is NOT a indie studio, it's a subsidiary of NEXON, so DtD is entirely a NEXON game, and with how their reputation is it's pretty understandable to not buy this game just because of that.\n- In terms of originality, this gets a zero.  It's a Robotron clone with pretty graphics.  There have been many of these, and my personal favourite is the original Mutant Storm which is sadly no longer available to buy.  However, the graphics are really really pretty, and the game play is really really good.  So for being the best implementation of the Robotron idea to date it gets a big thumbs up!\n\nSuggestions where it could be improved:\n[list]\n    [*]Graphics are so pretty they do sometimes make it hard to see what's going on.  Maybe have a less pretty looking mode.\n    [*]4 player co-op\n    [*]Online co-op\n    [*]Ability to save/pause arcade mode so you don't have to play through entire game in single session.\n[/list]\n- I would recommend ARK only in 1 specific case – you have a group of friends and will play on a private/local server. You get to enjoy the game at your own pace, with modified server multipliers, without the worry of PvP and server-dominating tribes. Graphics are great, the world is beautiful, lots of cool dinos to tame. There’s a lot to do, to build, to explore, to figure out.\n\nBut playing on a large PvP server is horrible experience. You are at a mercy of alpha tribes that have everything and can do anything. Slow progression, server wipes, laggy combat, so much grinding to catch up just to have your base destroyed while offline. Maybe you could find some servers where all this is more balanced but even then, it just becomes a game of who can grind more. It’s just not something I would ever recommend.\n- came for the cleaning mechanics and total lack of privacy, stayed for the secret lesbian love affairs\n- Are you looking for a medival game with great design and clever AI? Well then! ...keep looking. Just stop and turn around. I am serious. I know my \"game time\" says what? 10min? But its at least 2-3hours. \n\nI just sat there, trying to figure out what the heck I was supposed to do. Such as resources... why arent my people doing what I tell them to? My people just stand there and does nothing when i tell them to do something. \n\n\nIts like the developers decided \"meh, lets release and hope stupid people buy it so we can break even on this project\" becouse that attitude reflects how the game is. \n\n\nSave your money, walk away and spend them on something else. Litterly anything else...\n- This is easily one of the funniest games I played in 2017.  In the 20 hours it took me to solve it the first time, I pretty much did nothing else until I had finished it, despite the fact that I was supposed to be studying.\n\nThe game is set in absurd western themed world where humour is so baked into the fabric of everything that there is virtually nothing that isn't some kind of joke.  This could easily fall flat if it were poorly written, but I found the writing to be fantastic.  Obviouslly humour is subjective so if you aren't onboard with it's humour you proably won't get much out of it.  For everyone else you are due for a hell of a ride as the game is an absolute hoot.\n\nThe game takes place in a kind of openinsh world with your character setting out from a location on their horse. You can either select to \"Wander\" in which case you will make a broad loop out and around, potentially unovering new map locations or encountering a random encounter.  You can also direct travel to locations you have found and will also be told about map locations from NPC's or as the outcomes of various quests.    The world is feels quite expansive with a lot of interesting locations to explore.  There are a couple of central plot quests to pursue and a bunch of side quests as well.  In my 20 hour playthrough I managed to complete the main story but still had a few side things Id managed to miss all the clues for.\n\nCombat in the game takes place in a turn based format that should feel familiar to anyone has played a JRPG before.  You stand on one side, your foes tand on the other and you select your various attacks and abilities from a list specific to each characters class.  As you gain XP  you can choose what skills you buy so you can tailor your character to your play style, with higher skill levels costing increasing amounts of XP.  You can further personalise your character with a swathe of various equiment, almost all of which is humorous and absurd.  The combat is not particularly complex but its good enough and the humour is so good that it really does the heavy lifting for keeping you engaged.\n\nAs you can see from the screenshots the graphics portray everything in stick figures, but everything is surpisingly detailed and the great animation and the little touches really add to the charm of world.  A still screenshot doesn't really do justice to how much fun this game is to see in motion.\n\nThe music and sound are suprisingly good too, with twangy guitars and banjos mixed with good old time whistling and other wild west sounding stuffness.  Once again is better than you have any right to expect from such an overtly daft title and between the lively graphics and relelentless humour It's just another layer of polish to draw you into the games odd version of the wild west.\n\nLook I flat out loved this game. It was a delight. As I said, your milage may vary if the humour doesn't tickle your funny bone but I can tell you now, never have I laughed so hard at a game as I did digging through the spitoons in West of Loathing.\n\nGold.\n\n9 out of 10\n- [h1] Look at my hours real quick. That's about. 4 hours? [/h1]\n\nFallout 76 is boring. There's no other way to put it. The Core objective of Fallout 76 was to gear the Fallout 4 engine for multiplayer. They succeeded! The art is visually amazing, even down to the 2D art shown all over this store page, so what's wrong?\n\nConsider who's still playing this game. Who's desperate enough to play this game? Well, It's not a lot of people. And they aren't very good people. It's just people. Existing. I had 0 conversations during my 4 hours. \n\nLets talk playing. The game is boring. Since I just mentioned the objective, lets talk about the NPC's ETC. [b] I got this game for free, I cannot emphasize how little this game means to me. It's terrible. [/b] The NPC's & story were not part of core development therefore the game suffers. You get stuck doing some quests you don't care about and play a game you'd rather not play. The NPC's are essential as expected so, you cannot kill them either. \n\nMicrotransactions Via Atomic Shop & Premium plague the game [i] but lets talk about more! [/i] There's free events like a crate dropping & player trading outposts. Wanna know what's wrong here? The game boils down to, find a player trading outpost and buy sh*t, or just dropping crates? well the crates are full of nothing. the games gear-towards premium really gives you nothing in terms of loot so you're playing what is a hollow, unfinished, boring, game. Even in 2021! \n\nCreatures & enemies are cool however there's a big issue of the game not being cool. You may say its worth it to play just to engage the wild-life but even they feel soul-less and void of life. I don't know how you make a game so devoid of soul really. I've met mannequins with more personality than anything I met in Fallout 76. \n\nThe world isn't interesting, it's a barren void forestry area. Sometimes you get a tiny bit of quest, however aside from this game being a complete and utter lore-destroyer for those interested, what it does leave is not good enough to compensate for all of the cons. Honestly, if this was a mod for 4, I'd feel better. But even when getting this for free, I feel scammed.\n\n[b] I'll end this by repeating my hours. 4. At no point was I excited. Enthralled. Interested. I sat for 4 hours, wanting to tear my hair out and scream, because I was so bored. I had tests in school, more interesting than this. The entire 4 hours I spent playing, I wish I had played anything else, & I got this for free! I genuinely wish you the best of help if you end up buying this game. It's horrific. [/b]\n- \"it's a puzzle game dressed up as a wargame\"\n\n1. puzzle games don't have this much randomness\n\n2. it uses authentic hex wargame conventions/mechanics so it's more of a puzzle game built out of a wargame\n\n3. you can take the puzzle element out of it by customizing your game.yml file to allow +5 turns, then play each scenario slow\n- Don't play this game. \n\nWhen you realise you almost completed it and the 112% is approaching, you start to think \"What the fuck am I going to play after this?\".\n\nThe lore is incredible.\nThe gameplay is so hard sometimes, but extremely satisfying. \nThe bosses are super hard, yet super fun.\nThe OST is insane.\n\nIf you never played Hollow Knight and you are about to begin your journey in Hallownest, bapanada to you.\nYou're very lucky and I am very jealous.\n- Do you have friends? Do you want to play games with your friends?\nBuy this game!\nDo you not have friends? Are you in need of consolation due to the endless lonely Friday nights spent playing Solitaire? \nConsider playing Dwarf Fortress.\n- As a fan of Mimimi's Stealth Strategy Game,\nI love it so much, the operation system is getting smoother and more user-friendly comparing to Desperados III & Shadow Tactics.\nAlso I like how they added new elements to the game to make it more playable (E.g. Flexible team choice, character stories)\n\nThe only thing I don't like is the art.\nGame design is good but it'd be great if there's good looking characters...\n- The game died because the company could not support server costs and its a damn shame because it was a fucking blast.  Why this game died and Dungeon Defenders II lives is a mystery to me.  Please re-release the game with Peer to Peer networking and I will pay $$\n- I listened to the reviews, and went into this game 'blind', careful not to watch or read anything before purchasing, in order to get the full 'experience'.\n\nAfter 8 hours, I'm left feeling that this game is like one of those 'critically acclaimed' movies that wins every award going. Then you go see it, and leave the cinema  wondering what all the hype was about. I know I'm in the minority, but I guess I must like my games to be a lot easier, or less punishing than most people.\n\n\n** Minor non-story spoilers ahead **\n\n\n\n\nThe game employs a 'groundhog day' mechanic, that basically means you can only experience the game in 22 minute chunks, then you're thrown back to the starting location for another 'loop'. There's no manual save because the game saves automatically every loop. So, you might be nearing the end of exploring a cave system, with just one more objective to scout, and... whoosh... back to the start.  This forces you to retrace your steps and cover old ground again and again and again because you won't be fully exploring anywhere in 22 mins.\n\nThe controls (Keyboard/Mouse) are awful. You can't use the mouse to point and click UI elements, or the mouse wheel to zoom and/or navigate menus. You can only use the mouse for looking around, and everything else is done using an unintuitive bunch of keys that an ambidextrous octopus would struggle with. Guess I should have listened when the game warned me that it's better to use a controller! The game was clearly made for console, and doesn't translate well to PC.\n\nWhen you do get your head around the clunky controls, the 'realistic' physics adds nothing to the game except to create a keyboard-smashing level of frustration. Navigating space and/or the landscapes in this game is a mix of falling, crashing, ricocheting, overshooting, and generally wasting time to get where you want to go.\n\nIronically, despite promising to be a space exploration game, the navigation difficulty, the constant race against the loop reset, and race against other timed game elements, actually discourages exploration, and often punishes you for doing so.\n\nI thought I was buying a relaxing, cerebral story-driven journey with puzzles to solve. Instead I got a spelunking jumping, crashing simulator, the point of which seems to be gathering a jumble of fragmented story elements, jigsaw fashion, discovering a little bit more each loop. The 'puzzles' are all about navigating the locations, often time-dependant, to unlock more story elements.\n\n\nPerhaps there is a wonderful endgame that I will never get to experience... but I can't force myself through any more tedious, frustrating loops to get there.\n- Heard joke once: Man goes to doctor. Says he's depressed. Says life seems harsh and cruel. Says he feels all alone in a threatening world where what lies ahead is vague and uncertain. Doctor says, \"Treatment is simple. Steam is having a sale tonight. Go buy a game. That should pick you up.\" Man siles. Says to Doctor, \"good idea, Doc! A nice relaxing distraction!\" Man goes home. Man buys DF.\n\nGood joke. Everybody laugh.\n\n\n\nBut seriously, I built a working moat with a remote drainage system control tower and a 4 storey above ground fort, becoming a thriving 200-strong hold of what was once a moribund empire of less than 10 dwarves. 100/10 game that is definitely worth the learning curve.\n- Great Remaster, the same for Red alert 2 and Tiberium Sun next please!\n- Took me a while to play this because there were some critical bugs during release day, but the devs worked hard to fix everything up.\n\nNow, this is the premium version of Mad Father which is not just a straight re-release of the free version, but an upgraded one (in many ways, I'm told). Better graphics, better level design, better everything. It's a really tight experience without any filler and with an interesting story, so any fans of RPGMaker-type horror games will find this a highly enjoyable experience.\n\nYou can also increase the game's window size, so don't worry if you're running a high-resolution display. This is a feature that is not exactly common for these types of games, but this game has got you covered.\n\nI'm looking forward to future games from the dev!\n- [b][i]Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout[/i][/b] is a 60 Player Battle Royal game of minigames to triumph over everybody for the sweet, GOLDEN CROWN\n[list]\n[*] Put in about 40 hours in combination on Beta 1 & 2\n[*] Won a ton and lost a ton\n[*] Enjoyed EVERY SECOND \n[/list]\n[b][u]PROS[/u][/b]\n[list]\n[*] Decent amount of minigames for launch, and even when you play the same ones they feel fun when different things happen\n[*] Games go fast if you're winning OR losing, you're able to play a lot and experience the game faster to get better\n[*] The BIG majority of the cosmetics in the game are NOT locked behind a paywall. Release has one $5 DLC for a hamburger, slurpee, and frie cosmetic but there are a TON of cosmetics to earn through the free battle pass they give you + the daily shop where you can buy cosmetics with earned in game currency\n[*] Customization for your character is extremely extensive and allows a lot of different combos\n[*] The game is literally just FUN, like play for hours with friends fun. There is NO stress\n[/list]\n[b][u]CONS[/u][/b]\n[list]\n[*] See-saw minigame is very advantaged to the players in the front due to how messed up the see saws behind you get clogged with players and being on sides for WAY too long\n[*] Grabbing is a bit weird and janky, sometimes its useful and sometimes it actually screws you over\n[*] Ragdoll physics sometimes cause you to roll a ton after falling (I like this feature a ton but others don't)\n[/list]\n\n[b] I definitely reccommend picking this game up. The Devs put a lot of time and effort into a game and for $20 it is actually steal. This game will provide hours of content, especially with them already announcing they will update with new cosmetics and mini-games as ready. Please give this game a shot :)\n- Can we please get an online co-op? My s/o and I both have the game and remote play doesn't work cuz internet connection is too slow. So we can't even play this game that we were super excited to play together. Please update for an online co-op!\n- this game is something i have literally always wanted but never thought would exist. a historical fiction narrative that isn't about war or combat but rather something as mundane as being a maid... AND they let you actually clean the rooms. i have been asking for this for years and years and then these psychopaths go and actually make it?? unfathomable. love it. my only critique is that I can't high five Eugene or take Wendy to the malt shop to help her feel better\n\nin seriousness it's not the most wildly divergent choice-based narrative of all time (there are small choices throughout that have an impact, but most of the consequence is delayed so it doesn't FEEL as impactful in the moment), which might put off some people who want a more sandbox feeling. consider it more of a detective game than an RPG. worth experiencing even if you don't have my particular brand of mental illness tho, 100%, especially if you like these kinds of games in general.\n- Don't buy this game if you are planning a full co-op playthrough with a friend.\n\nAt first we thought only story progress wasn't shared which was fine as we'd both get to experience the missions regardless. However it turns out that all unlocks tied to completing each area such as new guns, cars and basically all the things you'd want to progress in are locked for the person who isn't hosting. This means your partner is stuck with the level 1 unlocks from start to finish unless they go back and do everything in their game as well.\n\nCompletely pointless and took us until clearing one of the lieutenants for us to realise this, bought this a while back too so not gonna be able to get a refund. Worst implemented co-op I have seen in a long time.\n- Note this is not \"Steampunk Civ\" so don't think of it that way. Its effectively a story/scenario driven city builder. The game looks beautiful and works well with the world building that goes on with the game. \n\nYour games will be short but its still fairly challenging depending on the scenario you choose\n\nDefinitely recommended\n- [i]While the artwork and combat remain enjoyable, the story, writing, and pacing were a major letdown.[/i]  \n\n***\nMINOR SPOILERS BELOW. If you're going to play the game, play before reading.\n***\n\n[b]The mature storylines, hard-hitting decisions, beautiful worldbuilding, and tight writing that made the first two so immersive is not present in this game.[/b] (You'll notice immediately that the writing for the caravan in the capital is [i]particular[/i] trite, awkward to read, and uninteresting.)\n\nUnfortunately, it's not just the writing that's weak. [i]The pacing is off.[/i] Antecedents are confusing, characters you'd expect to speak don't, events that should have been foreshadowed come out of nowhere. More frustrating are the serious character continuity \"errors,\" and arcs that disappear, change, or go nowhere. [i]In short, the events, decisions, and conflict from the previous games do not appear or resolve in a way that was suggested by the previous two[/i].\n\n\nHere's one example. In Banner Saga 2, Fosolt is unexpectedly rescued by Bolverk. [i]\"I have a message for Alette from the dead varl king,\" [/i]he said. That's pretty intriuging! Maybe there's a mystery, an oracle, an item, or just cool information about the Varl and their strange king? Maybe there'll finally be context about the bridge decision!\n\n[i]No! He has nothing interesting to say or add, and then his storyline just gets dropped and forgotten.[/i]\n\nWell, Bolverk's been possessed by Bellower! Gosh, who knows what Bellower will say? In fact, I can't wait to find out what happens to Bellower's body! \n\nWell, actually, Bolver's [i]not[/i] possessed, not really, certainly not like it was implied last game, and Bellower's body -- [i]a primary focus of the first two games[/i] -- isn't mentioned [i]once[/i]\n\nOr how about how they casually mention that Eyvyn is not only the [i]head[/i] of the Valka order, but also that he's had periodic bursts of hereditary madness all along? That's... odd. And it's not presented as an well-thought out [i]reveal[/i] or anything. It's presented matter-of-factly, like they were trying to ret-con in a less interesting story, or were tone deaf.\n\nYou'll notice that all the characters are underutilized and have unfulfilled storylines/tensions. Hakon has hard choices to make; Canary's a little crazy; Yrsa is mysterious; Gil's in love with Alette, etc. Will these build into choices? Reveals? Dependent endings based on choices? Will there be discussions referencing the past? Reflections on travels? Hints of despair?\n\nNo. In mine, Gil was [i]murdered[/i] and no one even bothered to reference it. Canary's situation never comes to a head. You never have to choose between Varls and Humans. Murdering people doesn't make people threaten to leave. Ubin returns randomly as an uber Varl and he's... learned the horseborne's language? Travelled the southlands? In like, a month? In a way that doesn't advance the plot? It's just... weakly done.\n\n\nThere are [i]so many[/i] examples like this, where the stories don't quite fit correctly, where what you picked up on in the early games about the [i]mysteries[/i] and the [i]world[/i] and what made it a [i]vibrant[/i] place were forgotten about by the writers. [b]The result is that it the game plays out in unsatisfying ways, in tenseless scenarios made vapid by watered-down morality, an inability to leverage the situation in fun ways, and low-quality writing, paucity of choice-making, a lack of exploration, lack of plot twists, simplified overworld mechanics -- all culminating in an almost staggeringly one-dimensional and shallow ending.[/b]\n\nThe Banner Saga series was always an experience that was greater than the sum of its part. An [i]experience[/i]. Of being [i]riveted[/i] to the computer, checking the map, worrying over supplies, guessing at mysteries, having my breath taken away at each hill. Unfortunately, that's not the case in this game. \n\n\nGameplay-wise, it's also a bit of a letdown. Combat is fun-ish, but you can make invincible character combinations and the mechanics don't even try to deal with this. There's an interesting new reinforcement mechanic that's not used heavily, and never pushes you like you think the end of the world would. You never really have to split up your forces. There's no novelty. Like maybe using a hero in a battle makes them fatigued, so you have to switch them up? Maybe you can station them different places, making them unusable for combat? Maybe you need to choose eight for a secret mission caravan? Maybe dream sequences? No, nothing like that. \n\nThe overworld gameplay had some changes that never really felt significant. Moreover, quite a bit felt taken away. You can't rest, do training missions, no longer weigh food vs upgrades. One example of all thise tone deafness was Iver's march through the destroyed world was consistently at \"Great Morale!\"\n\nThere didn't seem to be many flavor choices (\"Do we hang the criminals or let them join us?\"), including much less on social themes (\"Should women fight, if it disturbs the traditionally-minded men?\" \"One clan's rowdy, what do we do?\" \"They threaten to leave if so and so isn't banished\"), and less delayed results and fewer significant decisions, including among the game's built-up tensions among the factions. \n\n\nThere's also some cases of development [i]feeling[/i] cheap. Remember opening Banner Saga 2, and feeling that it was [i]fresh[/i], and [i]upgraded[/i]? There's little to make you feel that way here. The artwork is okay, but the environments feel more generic, with less variety, and the surreal landscapes in the darkness aren't especially interesting to look at for long periods of time. Iver is voiced by Bolverk's voice actor, and they sound exactly the same. The new title system is a fun idea, but is visually integrated into the game's menu system with the finesse of a cheap mod. \n\nThere's a moment in the game where the screen goes black for scrolling text and voiceover narration explaining the upcoming mechanic. Um, a character can't explain that? It was similar how the many two second animations are used, not to supplement the story, but to [i]replace[/i] written portions, making you feel unsure about what's going on. And finally, the game's pretty short, without fun combat challenges or interesting newgame+ challenges. \n\n\nWhat's [i]particularly[/i] frustrating is that the game's release date was moved forward four months. I don't know the story why, but I do know that a few more months of polish and story embellishment might have delivered the beautiful, grippingly interactive story we were hoping for. Because this is a watered down version of the previous two in just about every way.\n\nThis negative review is for whatever processes lead to this mediocre finale.\n\n---\n\n[i]Here's a plot that would have made more sense. Zephyr arrives and speaks to you secretly. There's a god that's still alive! Neat, now we'll finally get more story on that. Yay, fun caravan mode, now we need to take longships somewhere interesting!\n\nBut uh-oh! There's a Sundr villain going there as well, with an army of dredge! But at least now we'll finally get more story about the Sundr! \n\nThe god reveals something interesting, talks about Juno, the sun, gives a means to protect the city and help Iver. But when you return to the city, now the king and rugga and the factions have devolved into fighting based on your choices. How are you going to handle this? Which of many possibilities will ascend to the throne? How will you defend the city? And what mystery lies beneath the mountain of the city...\n\nFor Iver's caravan, there should be pockets of dredge villages kept alive by Spellsingers. Now you need to decide to plunder them or not! More stuff to do! Maybe go to the remains of the Varl capital first? Fight warped Valka? Realize deceptions, machinations, corruption, hear stories? Find new characters, have old ones die?\n\nInstead there... wasn't a plot?[/i]\n- Getting 100% was... very fun in this cute metroid-vania where you basically act as your own level designer.\n\napproximate amount of time to 100%: 20-30 Hours\nEstimated achievement difficulty: 5/10\nMinimum number of playthroughs needed: One (Most likely 2 if you go in blind)\nMultiplayer achievements: No.\nMissable achievements: Yes. Sequence Break, \nPoint of no return: No. After the game's ending you can return and explore.\nGrinding Achievements:  No.\nDLC-Only achievements: No.\nTime-gated achievements: No.\nSpeed-run achievements: Yes. 4 hour Speed run (and another 4 hour Speedrun but with 100% Secrets/gold etc...)\nRNG-achievements: No.\nIs there a good guide available: I recommend Demajen's Guide on steam with the super usefull map.\nDoes difficulty affect achievements: Yes, Medium recommended. (There's also a 0 death achievement)\nFirst achievement unlock: Defeat the first boss in the tutorial temple.\n\n* I can't remember how this game ended up in my account (might have been some promotional giveaway...) but I'm so glad it did.\n\nThis game has some of the best Quality of life I've seen. It's extremely enjoyable and the 100% journey is challenging but not too problematic. Wholeheartedly recommend this one.\n- it's a shame but i honestly cannot recommend this game if you are a disabled person, i wasn't that far into the game when my character started panicking apon seeing a disabled person [person with leg braces] and then gets a \"no good answer\" bit of dialog and all the options are saying something wrong or saying nothing, trying to go with the least bad option aside from saying nothing since i know as a disabled person myself [i'm a wheelchair user] it can be pretty upsetting getting people just randomly stare at me and at least when they say something slightly wrong they are engaging with me as a person, my character then proceeds to talk abt what an \"inspiration\" it is 2 c a disabled person living their life,,, not exaggerating when i say i let my head hit the desk, closed the game and uninstalled, i understand that this is probably put in the game to be a teachable moment for the able bodied audience but ironically in trying to educate about us disabled people they then made the assumption that no disabled people would be playing their game as there is no option to make your character disabled or even to make them remotely aware of disability and ended up just making the experience awful for the disabled gamers they seem to be trying to help\n- ✔ Procedurally generated levels (some are not)\n✔ Neat graphics and animations\n✔ Good sound design\n✔ Solid and gratifying game mechanics \n✔ Well-balanced difficulty curve\n✔ Linux support!\n\n✘ No DRM-free build (yet?)\n✘ No user-generated content (no level editor)\n\nRuns surprisingly well on very low-end specs computer (under Linux too!).\nAn excellent turned-based action strategy game. Very polished and entertaining!\nYet one more proof that Swedish developers are among the best on this planet.\n- Developers should be proud of themselves for this awful game.\nAfter a 3 hour session with a friend, my legs are stiff, my heart is confused with constant beating and my brain is extremely satisfied and wants more.\n\nIf you like being scared and the horror genre, just find a like-minded friend and play it. Even when you are simply running in and out, it's going be a lot of fun. I have no idea how one would play a medium map but maybe with 4 people one might have the courage to walk inside that cursed high school more than we did - which was 2 meters into the entrance. We didn't have the heart for more.\n\nOn a serious note: It is worth the price, hands down.\n\nPS: Devs, I hate you for how good this game is.\n\nEdit: I'm back after about two weeks and 50~ more hours. I've played at least a couple of rounds every single day and I still love the game.\n\nMy suggestion is to find a friend who'd enjoy this, get the game both and play. DON'T READ ABOUT IT! Just play for a while, enjoy screwing up, getting spooked, killed, whatever happens! The more you learn about the mechanics, the more you lose the fear, so don't read about it!\nI mean I'm still a coward at level 60 something but that's me. Of course if you are like me, then why are you reading this and not buying the game?\n\nFinal word: Check their discord to find like-minded people in the LFG! You won't be alone, I promise!\n- Full disclosure: I'm not a racing guy. I'm not a car guy, even. My extent of car knowledge begins and ends at \"vroom-vroom go that way.\"\n\nBut that's all you need to know for this game. I can tune the holy bejeezus out of a million sliders that mean absolutely nothing to me, or I can just equip a premade setting by someone who does and suddenly the vroom-vrooms are *better*. Not sure when to brake or start a turn? Easy, there's a friendly line. Follow the line, make less vroom-vrooms when it's red, everything's gravy. Don't have the reaction time to follow the line? You can slow the game down until it's at a pace where you can. Incredible.\n\nYou can be as serious as you want with it. Me, I'm taking my van that's dolled up to look like the Mystery Machine and ramping it off a volcano.\n- Everything apart from the matches is superb, best FM ever. \n\nThe match engine is fundamentally broken - too easy to split a defence open with a long ball resulting in a one-on-one, so SI nerfed the conversion rates of one-on-one chances to keep scorelines acceptable. The result however, is that your world class  striker misses 2-5 easy chances every game. \n\nWingers do not square the ball for strikers, instead preferring to shoot from obscenely acute angles rather than play the ball across the box. \n\nHalf the crowd is a repeated man in an orange jumper. This may sound minor but it's really immersion breaking once you notice it. You can be a team that plays in blue, and yet over 50% of the crowd are dressed in orange. It diminishes the match experience and detracts from the game as a whole.\n\nIt's crap like this, broken for 2 months now, I've bought every game in this series since the year 2000, I pre-order every year (literally the only game I will do so with) and said I'll continue to do so until I get burned. Well, SI Games, you've broken me at last. The 'Bugs' section of your forum is littered with these issues that are \"under review\", well you can consider my purchase of FM 2021 in the same category.\n\nEdit: I played a bunch more because apparently I'm a masochist. The match engine is total cack and has regressed massively since FM 2017. Don't waste your money - take up a more enjoyable pastime such as jamming needles in your eyes, you'll thank me for it.\n- A Short Hike is a relaxing, casual game about exploring an expansive, mountainous island park and eventually making your way to its summit so you can get cell phone reception.\n\nYou play as Claire, a bird who can climb, glide, and flap to great heights using a stamina system based upon how many golden and silver feathers you’ve collected. Along the path to the mountaintop you’ll encounter Animal Crossing-style characters who are friendly, punny, and usually have some minor task for you to solve, ranging from finding lost items to making deliveries.\n\nHelping residents of the island is completely optional, as is just about every activity in the game other than locating a few feathers and reaching the summit; as a result, length can range from an hour if you don’t stop to smell the roses to a few hours if you decide to make friends with everyone and see all the park has to offer.\n\nActivities include filling out a fishing journal by trading in your catches, digging in suspicious spots, solving treasure map clues, parkour racing, and opening up shortcuts by breaking blocked entrances and watering bouncy flowers. \n\nA Short Hike has a charming aesthetic and a lovely, peaceful soundtrack. I felt driven to see everything the game had to offer despite not being forced into any of it and never lost interest until I did so. It’s a beautiful little world that will make fans of Animal Crossing feel right at home.\n- Mixed review, so I will list the good and bad:\n\nGood:\n-Fun to play with friends\n-You have stuff to do for 20+ hours\n-Exploring and survival is done well\n-In creative you can build a pirate ship\n\nBad:\n-Sometimes lag\n-Sometimes trouble locating islands\n-Alone this is boring (sorry shark, you are not enough company)\n-My alpaca named Marcel keeps dying because he refused to eat (fixed now but rip 4 Marcels)\n\nEdit:\n+New engine and rudder added much control\n+New islands are easily explored by one person\n+Lore added\n+Finally you can charge your empty batteries\n+Finally you can too farm honey on your raft\n+Character models to find\n-Biofuel consumption and making is a meh for me\n-If you add saltwater too fast to the filter you lose the empty bottle or cup\n- I have it on the Epic store but the amount of stuttering it has made it unplayable so I gave up. I got the Humble choice for $6 to get a steam key and try it on here because I have a few games on steam that run well but run poorly on other platforms like the awful Windows store or the below average Epic launcher, but it's unfortunately the same deal on here for this game. It has done it on two entirely different computer setups for me so that tells me that they didn't bother to spend enough time testing enough different pc setup combinations when it was in development, and my pc setup isn't rare by any means. The look and functioning of the UI and menu's shows that it is a obvious direct console port which would explain their lack of attention to the pc version.\n\nEven giving it a fair shot based on content, it's pretty much just a modified version of Borderlands 2. The amount of dialogue is unbearable. No one in the game EVER shuts up, and every single last word they say is cringe. It's like a kid in fifth grade who laughs at fart jokes wrote the entire script. In addition to everyone never shutting up, the main boss randomly has page-long speeches over the radio just to make sure you get the message that they want you to feel entirely uncomfortable at this game's bottomless amount of cringe.\n\nThe gameplay is identical to BL2, with the only real new noticeable features being that some guns have two functions that you can toggle on and off with the C key and of course the new playable characters. However even without the stuttering ruining the game for me, it's my opinion that BL3's negatives, mainly the insane amount of neverending dialogue and how unbelievably cringe it is, overshadow its positives.\n- its a very stressful game and rly hard but the fact that u can lose all ur progress because of a mistake is on another level of insane but in the end if u r determined u will finish it and the feeling when u finish it after all the time is very good i never felt this good in my life about finishing a game or a puzzle its a rly good game i recommend\n- RPGMaker games are renowned for their hit-or-miss quality, with misses far outweighing the hits, at least in the Steam community. That risk said, I love going through the RPGMaker tags and picking out hidden gems. Do I miss a lot and get duds? Sure. But then I find a game like Ara Fell and realize why I enjoy taking my chances. \n\nNow to be fair, most people are playing the Unity version of this game now rather than the original RPGMaker version. While the Unity version is definitely the definitive and better version - I have played both - and it's original RPGMaker version was a very fun experience, too. \n\nThe presentation of this game is top notch. Never before  have a I seen an RPGMaker title that used many of the default assets, and yet made the design of the game their own to the point I had to remind myself of that fact. A lot of these Indie developed RPGMaker games use default assets, and that's fine - it's all about using them in unique and interesting ways, which is where a great many games fail, but not Ara Fell. \n\nSo the game manages to be a visual treat despite itself, but what about the music? Also top notch. Rarely do you play a game of this style and immediately get treated to unique and pleasant music right out of the gate, and it never ceases to be an auditory treat. Usually there is always those one or two tracks that you just don't care for, and it causes you to either mute the sound or to try to get through a section as quickly as possible, but not so in Ara Fell. \n\nGame play is probably the most unique asset this game has to offer. The battles are much more tactical than your traditional turn-based affair because MP is not a finite source - it regens over time. You are encouraged to not simply \"Mash A\" your way to victory. You need to use your skills to the fullest in battle. No really, you have to or this game will beat you to a pulp. While certainly not the most difficult game in the world, and can be cheesed with knowledge, it's no cakewalk either. You have to be smart and a bit strategic to get far in this game.\n\nAnyway, I could gush and gush about this game forever and not get bored. The point is, Ara Fell is an amazing RPGMaker (more so inspired now that it runs on Unity) title that is certainly a diamond among the pile of dirt and rocks. I would go as far to say it is my favorite game of it's caliber, and I have played a great many RPGMaker titles, some also very good. I can think of no higher praise to give this game.\n- Micromanage your 90%+ minority space colony simulator 2017\n\nSeriously, when choosing my starting colonists I had to reroll 15-20 times per colonist to get a white male colonist. It's almost like this game was made for Swedens' liberal party or something\n\n0/10 for feminista multi-kulti propaganda\n- oh good god how do i remove things from my library\n- With almost 300 hours of Destiny 2 (D2) back on Battle.net (the Blizzard launcher), let me give this perspective/advice for new players, specifically with regards for the F2P offering that is Destiny 2: New Light, with a few more holistic thoughts sprinkled throughout:\n\nThis overall game is very good. It doesn't always live up to its promise (the first mission of every campaign is always the most polished thing aside from the raids/dungeons), but when it does, it [b]really[/b] shines.\n\nThe gunplay is unrivaled. The visual/audio feedback is great, the handling feels really good, and enemies really pop when you take them out. Expect nothing less from the studio that brought us grunt birthday parties.\n\nThe game is better in a fireteam. Now that the base game is F2P [though with considerably less content than it used to be/I would like], this should be easier than ever for most activities. That said, a huge majority of my playtime was done solo. It can get tricky at times (\"Darkness Zones\" in certain missions prevent respawning but allow for revives, so solo players have a distinct disadvantage there). \n\nWith that said, dungeons (currently 'The Shattered Throne', 'Pit of Heresy', 'Prophecy' which is free to all players, 'Grasp of Avarice', 'Duality', and 'Spire of the Watcher') and raids (\"Last Wish\" from Forsaken, \"Garden of Salvation\" from Shadowkeep, \"The Deep Stone Crypt\" from Beyond Light, 'Vow of the Disciple' from Witch Queen, as well as 'Vault of Glass' and 'King's Fall' from D1 - both of which are both free to all players) are best experienced with a team, so don't shy away from LFG group-finder options like the Discord, official app, or any number of other sites (just make sure to accurately describe your experience, level, and gear. 'Tis only polite). \n\nOf the matchmade multiplayer offerings, I enjoy Gambit (PvPvE, reminds me of the Black Ops Zombies 4z4 mode done right), jump into the occasional Strike (PvE, matchmade fireteams running campaign-like missions), and have no interest in Crucible (PvP, it's fine I guess, but I've never liked PvP that's dependent in large part on personal progression - especially in the competitive modes like Trials of Osiris and Iron Banner)\n\nDon't be afraid to ignore content - this is absolutely the kind of game where you can set your own goals. Want a specific exotic gun? Look up where it drops and focus on grinding that content. Want a specific roll on a random roll gun? Find the best possible farming (or crafting) method and go to town. Chase down some of the exotic questions that the game clutters up your quest page with, or just goof around doing things that you find fun while absolutely ignoring all signposts.\n\nSome stuff just won't be explained in game. It's not as bad as Warframe (much less need for a wiki) but some things are still obscured. Feel free to look up Xur (exotic weapon vendor who visits on weekends) and other hidden exotics tied to specific activities, lost sectors, patrol locations, or quest chains.\n\nFor anything that you can't easily find online - reach out and find a sherpa. The community for this game tends to be pretty great, and enough of us have spent enough time leaning specific parts of it (e.g. raids) or just mechanics in general (\"What are random rolls? Which do I keep?\") that we'd be happy to jump onto discord (there are a bunch for PC, just check out the subreddit sidebar linked below) and answer any and all questions you may have. \n\nThe fact that a representative chunk of this game is free makes this the perfect time to dip your toes in without emptying out your wallet. Any other questions about this game as a product (\"Should I pay for DLC? Is Eververse worth it?\") should absolutely be researched elsewhere.\n\nIf you're looking for a place to start with the F2P content, finish the intro missions in the Cosmodrome. New and returning players are semi-regularly upgraded to a new light level floor, but means that you can miss out on the \"learning the ropes\" parts of the game that come with working your way through the New Light quest chain or unlocking different subclasses.

Release order was Red War (launch campaign) > Forsaken > Shadowkeep > Beyond Light > Witch Queen, followed by the upcoming expansions Lightfall > Final Shape.]\n\nEyes up, guardian.\n\nFootnotes for people yelling at me in the comments:\n-All of this is my opinion. Feel free to hold your own and disagree with mine.\n-I generally enjoy grinding, looter shooters, FPS's, and weird sci-fi space magic. Halo, Borderlands, Warframe, and CoD Zombies are some of my most-played and favorite games.\n-As far as I can tell, anything that is not strictly subjective in the above is factually correct [as of Season of Plunder, with updates noted throughout. This game changes quite a bit over time, so make sure to do your own research before spending money on it]. If I've missed something, feel free to point it out in the comments and I'll do my best to update this periodically. \n-This review previously made mention of both content vaulting and weapon sunsetting. These practices have both been discontinued as of Season of Plunder. However, it is not clear at this if or when power capped or vaulted may return/be uncapped, if ever.\n\n-----------------\nTL:DR: It's good. Not perfect, but really good. And since it's free, you can get a really good sense of if this game is for you without paying for any of it. You can play almost any activity solo pretty easily except for a handful of endgame activities. If you're overwhelmed at first, just play through the Cosmodrome missions while you get your feet under you, or ask a veteran player for help.\n-----------------\n\nSites to use (List was compiled at Shadowkeep launch, but most of it should still be relevant/useful)\n\n    \nBeginner's Guide (Current as of Beyond Light) - https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/49007\n\nThe DTG Subreddit - /r/DestinyTheGame on Reddit - https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/\n\nDestiny Item Manager (mange your inventory from your browser even while in-game, essential to avoid unneeded trips back to the tower) - app.destinyitemmanager.com\n\nDestiny 2 Checklist (Lists out everything to do as well as when it resets in-game) - www.d2checklist.com/\n\nLight gg (Database of in-game items, useful for looking up random rolls) - https://www.light.gg/\n\nBraytech org (Lots of overlapping features, but I really like their maps) - braytech.org/\n\nDatto (Destiny Youtuber / 24:02 Raider who posts lots of useful/educational content, including exotic guides) - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkmAjbIecTIjTQctolYeuDw\n\nIf you've played D2 on another system, check out the CrossSave page (https://www.bungie.net/7/en/crosssave) on the Bungie net official site respectively to get all of your content and progression moved over to Steam.\n\nStory Recap up through Shadowkeep (Spoilers Destiny 1 / D1, and D2, obviously) (My name is Byf on YouTube: The Complete Story of Destiny!

I never had a gaming experience quite like this one, and it really felt as if I had to deduce and think things through. It made me feel more like a detective than most point-and-click mystery adventures. And don't get me wrong, I wouldn't include this game in that category, which I love.\n\nThe plot was amazing, and it was full of clever bits. The game got challenging in a good way without going overboard, and I think the vast majority of deductions was fair, except perhaps one in case 9, which I doubt I would have ever gotten without an in-game hint. The end was a bit anticlimactic after such a build-up, but overall it was a very satisfying journey. I'd definitely be interested in other games using the same concept. If you're unsure, like I was, I suggest trying out the demo where you can play 4 out of the 12 cases.\n- I knew Journey is a great game,maybe one of the best video games in history,but...\n\nI didn't know why so many people moved by such a simple gameplay.\nI didn't know why people had a Journey-Fever,even players just bought PS3 only for this game.\nI didn't know how close a relationship could be in 100mins only.\nI didn't know how bad i wished to go back to the peak and stay with my friend i'll never meet again.\n\nNow I Know.\n\n“It is better to walk with a friend in the dark than alone in the light” – Helen Keller\n\nIt was an interesting experience for me, I had never played this game nor heard of it until recently. I went and looked at the store page, My Brother/Friend Ethan-Winters Just Told Me this game in the steam store now, so went ahead and bought it. After buying it, went and started up the game some day later. Went into the game, saw another model character that looks like mine, I thought it was an AI because I had thought it was a single player game. So I decided to play along with it, we went through the story, it progressed quite fast, mainly because we both did not really bother to check out other things. The more I played, the more I realized that the guy I was playing with was most definitely not an AI, it was a genuine player. As we went through the story, our cooperation got smoother, we no longer have a solo player attitude, we would signal to each other, wait for each other and walked, fly with each other. It was smoothing, relaxing, a truly unique experience. Even with the setbacks we had throughout our progression, we never gave up, we stuck together from the desert till the end, when one of us screwed up, we patiently waited for the other, chiming to the person where we are. I remember at the end, when i screwed up a jump and did not see the other player, I was genuinely scared, sad, I frantically searched for the person but to no avail. I was distraught, sad and disappointed but I continued onward. When I went up, there he was, chiming for me, assuring me that he had not left yet. I felt happy, comforted when I saw the person waiting for me and together we finished the story. I am not one to do reviews, but it was such a unique experience among my years of gaming that I had to share it. Thank you, punks for the experience, truly thank you. And thank you, for bothering to read my review.\n\ni'll never forget our journey kind stranger.\n\nThis wasn't a game, it was an experience. I highly recommend you do this.\n- ULTRAKILL is a fine game with cool movement mechanics. However most of the guns don't feel beefy at all and, really, there's not much content to be had. Wait for ACT 3 before forking out $20 for this.\n\nedit: after getting every p rank, gaming\n- This game is set to release in early October, but I definitely wouldn't buy it anytime soon. It's not ready. It's full of weird little errors, the mechanics and UI are clunky as hell, there's a lot of information you really need but don't get, the \"events\" are incredibly repetitive, half the time the wording is so bad you're left confused what's actually happening, even the basics aren't there- random capitalization, no consistency from panel to panel or objective to objective... This game needs another 6 months in EA.\n- They need to add more weapons like a galil or m249 or something and maybe more vehicles and playmodes.But overall so many possibilities\n- This game is set to release in early October, but I definitely wouldn't buy it anytime soon. It's not ready. It's full of weird little errors, the mechanics and UI are clunky as hell, there's a lot of information you really need but don't get, the \"events\" are incredibly repetitive, half the time the wording is so bad you're left confused what's actually happening, even the basics aren't there- random capitalization, no consistency from panel to panel or objective to objective... This game needs another 6 months in EA.\n- Ok so... \n\nFar From Noise is a narrative game in which you play a woman stuck in its car, balancing on the edge of a cliff. \n\nIt's about life, death, nature, purpose, creativity, dreams, stars and badgers. \n\nThe thing about Far From Noise is that it'll ask you something very special, something that we all forget to do nowadays, something that I've forgotten. This game will ask you to take your time. Don't rush things. Sit down and relax as you'll be forced to follow the slow pace of the game, but you'll enjoy it, for sure.\n\nThis game is for you if you come home after a rough day at work. This game is for you if you're searching for a meaning, a purpose in your life. This game is for you if you just want to experiment something new.\n\nBecause Far From Noise is offering you something new. It gives a vibe that is between Firewatch and Life is Strange, but without all the forced action, stress, adrenaline those game wanted to give. Don't misunderstand me, I loved those 2 games, but Far From Noise chose a direction more... pure. It's just you and the nature that evolves around you.\n\nI've finished the game within 90 mins, but I heard they were several endings, so I might as well try to get some more (but the one I've got fully satisfied me, to be honest).\n\nBeing more pragmatic, the art and sound coincide perfectly. The visuals are gorgeous and the musics hit just right where it needs to. You'll be lifted by the compositions as you'll stare into the beautiful sunset, and the dark starry sky.\n\nYou may find it expensive, as the game costs 8$ for one hour and a half of experience, but hey, think about a cinema ticket. Far From Noise is cheaper and the experience you'll live in it is wayyyyy more unique than most of the movies you go see. \n\nI recommend it. Play it. It'll put your mind at ease.\n\n\n\nPS: the main character is one of the most well-written i've seen in video games.\n- I am a day one player who quit the game within a few days. After coming back after almost 2 years, I am shocked and surprised. The overall improvement is great, quests are not bothering you. Story and atmosphere is hooking you up and the overall experience is good. Leveling up is easy and also you are not struggling as in most MMOs.\n\nDespite the past of the game, I think it is worth trying.\n- Wanna spend 20% of the time scared, 60% of the time confused, 15% of the time infuriated, and 5% of the time laughing your ass off? THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU!\n\nFor the rest, save your money.\n\nIt's so buggy, dark, poorly optimized, and confusing; you'll spend more time pulling your hair out than the rare moments that it actually manages to pull off a jumpscare. Also, it is NOT procedurally generated at all. Watched a YouTuber play this game and got the exact same map and jumpscares... er... \"jumpscares\" as they did. Not worth $10. If they can fix the bugs and tweak a few things, though, it'd at least be worth 5.\n\n- This game is amazing! Truly the Dark Souls of little girl simulators.\n\nI’m glad that Dark Souls taught me how to dodge in literally every video game, it unknowingly prepared me for this. Ender Lilies is a Soulslike with JoJo Stand combat. That’s an instant win for me.\n\nThe world is depressing, suffocating and overwhelmingly beautiful. Each stories of the main spirits are well written and realistically human. The endings are top notch too.\n\nIf you’re even considering playing it… play it… I promise you won’t regret it. I was much more emotionally invested in this game than I was on Hollow Knight. Lilly is an amazing protagonist… and she never even utters a word. She doesn’t have to.\n\nIt's a beautiful game with fun combat, awesome art and amazing music. My only real complaint was a bit of exploration fatigue having to go around finding all the collectibles. \n\nI think the easiest way to sum up Ender Lilies is \"It's Momodora, but better.\" It has the same gameplay loop of \"slash slash roll behind the enemy slash slash repeat\" and fairly challenging bosses, in a much bigger and more non-linear world with nearly every single room having some sort of collectible. It's also aesthetically atmospheric and pleasing, and the soundtrack is great.\n\nI can safely say that this game is a creative masterpiece. And in the end… Like Lilly, don’t we all have a little girl inside of us, telling us to stop all this silliness and go back to being the proper good boys our Mother wanted us to be?\n\n10/10\n- As a historical novelist and former high school English teacher with over 700 books in my home devoted to ancient Greek literature, history and culture I had to try this game.\n\nI should mention that I am pushing 60 years old and although I like strategy games like Creative Assembly’s Rome II, I’m not a fan of ‘gopher’ games that make you run around collecting items, rescuing damsels in distress, delivering messages, and murdering politicians to level your character.  The whole premises seems rather tedious and unimaginative.  \n\nSo right from the start I expected to hate Assassin’s Creed Odyssey.  Combine that with the fact that I’d never played an Assassin’s Creed game before, and I am not the most nimble finger clicker, I was prepared to spend a good portion of my playing time getting my head lopped off.  \n\nNone of that happened.  Well, yeah, there is a pretty steep learning curve here.  I did spend a lot of my initial hours zigging when I should have been zagging, and with my opponent’s spear in my head, but I stuck with it and eventually even an old poop like me was able to figure out the mechanics.\n\nWhat kept me going was the sheer majesty of the game and the beauty of the surroundings.  \n\nI’ve been to Athens, Sparta, Argos, Mycenae, Delos, Aegina, Hydra, Crete, Melos (now Santorini), and dozens of other locales on the campaign map multiple times.  I’ve walked around the ruins at Delphi, strolled the docks of Piraeus and walked through valley of Laconia for research for my books.  I wanted to see these places at they might have looked 2,500 years ago and that for me is the true joy of Assassin’s Creed Odyssey.\n\nThe team at Ubisoft deserves a lot of credit.  They did their homework.  Sure, you’d expect to see historical figures like Pericles, Socrates, Alcibiades and Archidamas in a game about the Peloponnesian War.  But that anyone outside of academia even knows who Brasidas, Aspasia, Herodotus and Pausanias were, is impressive.  Kudos to you.\n\nI’m probably an oddball gamer because I was not motivated by stabbing people in the back to gain levels and steal loot.  The entire idea of stabbing people in the back goes against the grain of the Greek ethos of ‘kleos’ or honor.  What kept me going was the desire to see more of the world that Ubisoft created.  \n\nI wanted to visit the Athenian Acropolis and see the Propylaea, Erechtheion and Parthenon as they were shiny and new, instead of in piles of rubble.  I wanted to gaze up at Phidias' statue of Zeus in Olympus (one of the wonders of the ancient Greek world that no longer exists), speak to the Pythia at the temple of Delphi, and see the five villages of Sparta as they might have looked.  Getting to walk the streets of Athens, Argos and Elis was like taking a trip back in time.  Magical.\n\nOkay, the game isn’t perfect.  The pronunciation of common names like Pericles and Socrates and the character’s accents were maddening.  I can only guess that Ubisoft believes we’ve Americanized the real pronunciations, or at least I hope that’s what they were thinking.  Ultimately it’s a minor annoyance.\n\nThe hoplite battles were a major disappointment.  The Greeks fought in a phalanx formation.  Shoulder to shoulder.  Shield to shield.  The battles here are a 300 movie style free for all.  Oh well, guess you can’t have everything.  \n\nAlso I could not fathom how Alexios and Kassandra could be descended from Leonidas, but have no connection to the Agiad royal family.  By rights they should have been Pausanias’ cousins, but they’re not.  I don’t know who they are. The whole Pythagoras-is-my-father thing is rather bizarre and makes no sense at all.  \n\nI won’t go off the charts here listing the historical inaccuracies that drove me batsh!t crazy, as it serves no purpose.  Suffice it to say that I enjoyed the game.  \n\nIf you ever wanted to unravel the labyrinth of the minotaur beneath King Minos palace at Knossos, get drunk and sing songs with Socrates at an Athenian symposium, feel the Aegean Sea roll beneath your feet on the deck of a  trireme, or stare out in wonder at the lights twinkling over Attica at twilight, try this game.  You won’t be disappointed.\n- Incomphrehesible UI, sloppy controls.\n\n\nGranted I'm a day one player, but very steep learning curve. Couldn't figure out interstellar nav, for the life of me, and the touchy controls made the dogfighting a chore. Save your money. This isn't a jump in and play game.\n- It's DND but you're a schizo pizza guy and you have to rizz everyone up at the club\n\n8.5/10\n- Was a bit turn off when I saw it was a stationary shooter, but the game is so fun I look past that and even began to enjoy the room scaling dodging mechanics (game can make you work up a sweat!).\n\nA must for anyone looking for a more intense arcade shooting experience. I cannot overstate how fun it is to build your weapons in VR, the crafting system works flawlessly and seemely without the need of menus or UIs getting in the way, props for the devs for how well the game integrates with VR controls.\n\nWhat I liked:\n- Varied enemies\n - Great VR controls\n- Gun crafting is addicting and allows for a lot of experimentation\n- Great Bosses\n\nWhat I had trouble with:\n- Makes you wish you could run around the rooms like the original game!\n- The reduced FOV of most VR headsets makes it quite difficult to keep track of enemies that come from multiple directions. Some rooms require so much head movement that I tend to get sick.\n- When a room spawns with multiple shield pylons and a healer bot, it gets extremely frustrating if you have slow moving projectile weapons.\n\nWishes:\n- More gun parts! (Maybe future DLC?)\n- When I first played Battlefield 1 it literally sent me to the hospital, cause you’re supposed to seek immediate medical attention if your erection lasts longer than 4 hours.\n\nThis is easily one of the most badass games  in history. The music, the landscape, the gunplay, the hit register and the satisfying kill effect, EVERYTHING is just amazing. The last true Battlefield game. I enjoyed every second of this amazing game.  \n\nBF1 isn’t fully historically accurate but it is historically immersive. The war stories in this game genuinely made me emotional sometimes and I’m not ashamed to admit that. \n\nAs someone who is more on the “historical accuracy” side of games, I can say without a doubt that Battlefield 1 did an incredible job. Hell, they were even able to be diverse without pandering to anybody! The 1st Russian Women’s Battalion of Death, the Harlem Hellfighters, people from French-occupied northwestern Africa, the list goes on. What sets this game’s inclusivity of a variety of people and groups from other games is that it does so when it has a reason to and is still accurate to the time and setting. \n\nThat’s one of the main reasons why Battlefield 5 pissed me off so much. Instead of a British woman with a prosthetic arm wielding a cricket bat in WW2, why not include Lyudmila Pavlichenko, aka Lady Death, a female Russian sniper who had 309 confirmed kills? What about the French women who fought? They were in extremely small numbers, but they were a thing. Historically accurate inclusion is fucking awesome, and I love when games do it. But inclusivity for its own sake is terrible and it cheapens said character’s presence in the game’s setting. \n\nEven the DLC are fantastic. I remember how amazing I felt when the “for the Tsar” DLC came out and I first played it. I have never seen people fight so hard to the death in a video game without a whole lot of rage. It was amazing. I felt like I was part of the Russian revolution. Please do yourself a favor and buy this game.\n\n9/10\n\nOnly gave it a 9 ‘cause the 1 is already there…\n- I reviewed the original Mark of the Ninja more than 4 years ago. I liked its stealth-based gameplay approach and praised the learning curve experienced throughout the story. I bought the [i]Special Edition[/i] which practically meant an add-on with some more levels, a custom and the option to replay the entire game in commentary mode. \n\nYou know some games get re-released due to the availability of a new console generation. This [i]Remastered[/i] edition is what was made available for PS4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch users not long ago. We, PC gamers (who already own the original Mark of the Ninja), can get this version free-of-charge in our library.\n\nThere's not much to say, really. I do not have a 4K display so this higher resolution I cannot enjoy. Compressed in-game art or not the original already looked very good. But the creators confirmed this will give us an enhanced experience even under 1080p resolution. \n\nWell, I did complete the game once again as this is how much I love MoN. I recommend that you do the same.\n\nPS: It may be possible that you are required to have the special edition of the original version to get the remastered version.\n- Mori's 3-Part Review:\n1. Bare minimum information and recommendations to improve your playthrough\n2. Background information on me and my playthrough\n3. More extensive non-spoiler reactions\n \nPart 1: Recommendations for You\nIf you're like me and you try to get all the extra scene dialogue, then please, if you take nothing else from this, give yourself time to play this game yourself. There is actually so much content here, I really want you all to take your time to experience it as you go. The game is just too long to binge in a reasonably short amount of time, and if you do binge, you're going to lose a lot.\n \nMy recommendations:\n1. Give yourself time to play the game. Let it sink in, and take notes- it'll be rewarded. The game is literally too dense and too long to binge reasonably if you like 100%ing.\n \n2. Get invested in the characters and pay attention to them, not just the (admittedly stellar) mysteries.\n \n3. Explore the game, its mechanics, and its dialogue yourself. Don't be afraid to restart a Somnium several times; the more options you pick, the more meaningful information you get.\n \n4. If you're a puzzle lover then try to solve the game yourself. You're going to have a blast if you manage it, and the game has tons of built-in hint systems to make it even easier, fairer, and more fun.\n \n5. Try to go in knowing at little as you can. The marketing has already done a great job. Focus on finishing the game and bringing it all together.\n \n6. On PC, force anti-aliasing on using your graphics card to make the game prettier. Game ran and controlled smoothly with few bugs.\n \n7. You don't need AI1 to play AI2, but I think AI2 does spoil AI1, though you could still enjoy them in reverse order.\n \n7. If you're sensitive to horny then just read less background dialogue in Ryuki side. Gore is pretty toned down, and there isn't any single huge CW.\n \nYou can stop reading now if you don't want your playthrough tainted by my reactions/expectations effected.\n \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nPart 2: Who am I, and how do I play?\nI'm an Uchikoshi fanatic. I've played all his English-translated games, and visual novels are my favorite genre of game. I've played a lot of visuals novels, but Uchizawa's are my favorites. I usually try to 100% complete all the scenes and see all the bonus dialogue. I've also played a lot of other genres of game, and I do like fun gameplay, but the most important things to me tend to be:\n \nA. An interesting story is absolutely what gets me invested\nB. Bunches of novel ideas like unique plot points I haven't seen before, philosophical ideas, or puzzles\nC. Characters that I at least don't actively hate; I can like a game for the above two, but characters still matter\nD. Deep personal connection, usually formed by connections to real people or how a game shaped my life\n \nThose are the ways I rate my top games. For the last 8 years, my top 2 favorite games have been the same:\n \nMy top favorite game of all time is Remember11. I love the plot, the ideas, the twists, the characters, and it's what got me truly invested in Uchikoshi. It's very much a mystery game first with an unravelling mystery and themes I love to explore.\n \nMy second favorite game is Virtue's Last Reward. I love the interactive moral dilemmas. VLR's use of the Prisoner's Dilemma jumpstarted my interested in Philosophy which led me to major in Philosophy. I don't like the characters as much save for a few, but it's still very important to me.\n \nNow, let me tell you how I've played AINI: I've basically been playing non-stop since June 13th.\n \nTake this with a grain of salt because I've been documenting as I play (the average main story playtime seems to be 20-35 hours, with 100% likely taking 50+), but right now, I have 97 hours of playtime. I have not gotten all the dialogue, achievements, or fully explored the abundance of extra mechanics. Instead, I have a 616-page reaction document full of constant laughs, cries, screams, passing out, and most of all love.\n \nPart 3: My Review\nThe R11 #1 and VLR #2 holy duology held true for 8 years. Also, AI1 isn't one of my favorite standalone games; it has huge personal connection for me because of the community and the AI1 ARG, but it wasn't my favorite as a game.\n \nI gave all that background because I want you to take me seriously when I say this:\nAI2 is my new favorite game. The #1 spot has been Easily dethroned.\n \nThe themes, twists, characters, ideas, gameplay, visuals, voice acting, fair mystery, presentation, mechanics, and comedy all of it resonates together perfectly. I don't even tend to value gameplay or visuals, but at many times, this game is fun to play while looking genuinely beautiful and cinematic.\n \nThe story reads like a proper Uchikoshi + Nakazawa return to form. The mystery is fair, interesting, meaningful, and complex told satisfyingly. There are many deep ideas, concepts, and themes utilized in thought-provoking ways.\n \nGameplay-wise, there are tons of mechanics that are utilized to make each Somnium unique; they all feel designed by love, fair, and reflective of the character through gorgeous symbolism. They blow the first game completely out of the water. Each one is its own experience to explore and a visual delight. There are also tons of mechanics for you to discover that make AI2 a fun game to play.\n \nThe animations, voices, and directing are cinematic; this game is actually breathtaking a lot of the time. It's backed up by great and charming character writing- despite the fact Mizuki is my favorite AI1 character with 0 contest, I grew to like much of the AI2 cast the same amount.\n \nAI2 is a story about halves and splitting, but also love and coming together- please, see it through until it's whole. I hope and believe you will all fall in love with AI2 like me; AI2 is all I've ever wanted. AI2 is my dream game come true; it's a gorgeous love letter to all Uchikoshi fans who love Zero Escape's puzzles, Infinity's mysteries, and AI's characters and humor.\n- ✔ Procedurally generated levels (some are not)\n✔ Neat graphics and animations\n✔ Good sound design\n✔ Solid and gratifying game mechanics \n✔ Well-balanced difficulty curve\n✔ Linux support!\n\n✘ No DRM-free build (yet?)\n✘ No user-generated content (no level editor)\n\nRuns surprisingly well on very low-end specs computer (under Linux too!).\nAn excellent turned-based action strategy game. Very polished and entertaining!\nYet one more proof that Swedish developers are among the best on this planet.\n- Please, bare with me here...I NEVER write reviews for anything (this is probably the third review I have ever written), but I feel like I need to write this one for so many reasons!!!  I grew up playing the Telltale/Lucas Arts Series: Monkey Island. After discovering and playing those, I figured out that I have an infinite amount of love for Point and Click adventure games. After finishing that series, I really only played the other games made by either Lucas Arts or Telltale (Mostly because I thought they were the only creators of Point and Click games...until about a year ago, when I discovered there's an entire genre/world of Point and Click).  Of course, I must also note: The Curse of Monkey Island will always be my fav, as it was the first Point and Click I ever played. Ok...NOW...with all of that being said, I recently discovered WADJET EYE GAMES and I am SO happy I did. I would recommend EVERY.SINGLE,GAME they sell. I have played all of their MAC/iOS compatible Point and Clicks, and I have yet to be (even slightly) disappointed. I had very high expectations going in as the Monkey Island games, Day of the Tentacle, Full Throttle, Grim Fandago, etc. are some of the best games in the history of Point and Click; however, all of the games I have played from Wadjet Eye have been amazing. They have actually been so amazing that I can 100% say Wadjet Eye is at the top of my list, right there with the Telltale/Lucas Arts games. I 100% recommend purchasing and playing every game made by Wadjet Eye to anyone who likes (even those who kinda sorta like) Point and Click games.\n- [h1][b]★★★★☆[/b][/h1]\nSuper Time Force Ultra (STFU...) hits all the stereotypical tropes of an indie game. Fourth wall breaking humor, bright pastel colors, a synth soundtrack and of course retro graphics. Granted, this game came out in 2014, but today, frequent gamers might be sick of this. Despite that, the game certainly is still worth checking out. Behind the bad, immature humor lies a very apparant, unique and interesting game mechanic: the ability to rewind time and to run next to your former self.\n\nThe humor really turned me off the first time I booted this game up. It's too much in your face and it tries really hard to be funny. On top of that, it also tends to be really profane. There is a character that you can control that literally is a turd that has an ability to fart. One of the levels takes place within a sewer where you have to fight poop and ride it down pipes. Humor like this makes it feel like you're playing a game made by a 13 year old.\n\nThe gameplay, on ther other hand, is suprisingly refreshing and fun. Not only can you rewind time, you will also see your former selves run next to you and do the same damage as before. The whole game is build around this 'cloning' mechanic, as levels have to be finished within a certain time limit that can only be beaten with cooperation with yourself. For example, it can take forever to take a boss out by yourself, but by rewinding (to any moment you like) you can use more firepower to kill the boss faster. As you can imagine, this can create scenes where you fight of enemies along [i]many[/i] other characters you have controlled. It's the good kind of chaotic, as it never feels random to what happens in the game. My only real problem with it are the controls that don't always seem to registrate well. For instance, when you run of a slope, your character tend to be in the air just a couple of pixels high, which means it cannot jump. I ran off so many platforms because of this, but it is not a severe problem.\n\nThe game is not particulairy hard. You can rewind lots of times and by doing so, the level gets easier and easier. The dev also included a kind of trial mode, aside from the diverse story levels. Some of these levels are a little annoying, but ultimately I had fun with it in short sessions. The achievements are also not hard to unlock. It mostly involves collecting orbs and characters.\n\nFor the standard 13 bucks, this is not a bad deal! That is, if you go for all the achievements. When it is on sale, I would say this is a safe buy.\n- A fun game for drinking parties, take a shot every time you feel like you just wasted 19 cents.\n- This is a review about the port, not the game. The game itself is fantastic. I reference Moguri Mod throughout the review - this is a fan made mod that aims to improve the visual quality of the port.\n\nThe port is a lazy outdated mess:\n- It's lacking visual FX present in the original, such as the mist in the overworld of the Mist Continent. [b]This was fixed in a patch.[/b]\n- There is no way to restore the original font. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- Dialogue is rendered at a static pace, unlike the original. In the original game, lines of dialogue would show up on screen depending on how fast the character was talking. In this port, there is no distinction. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- There are multiple problems with the battle UI:\n-- It takes 40% of the screen. Square Enix patched this in the console versions, but the PC version was never patched. [b]This patch was released on PC in an update on the 6th of August 2020.[/b]\n-- It's rendered at what feels like 15fps, making navigation feel extremely clunky. In the original game, all menus were rendered at either 30fps interpolated or 60fps (don't know which one exactly), which made the browsing very fluid. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- All menus are clunky to browse because of the crippling low framerate. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- It's missing sound effects from the original. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- Despite porting the game to Unity, Square couldn't be bothered to re-write the animation code to speed up battle animations independently of buff/debuff tick timers, arguably the original game's biggest problem. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- The music in this port is a lower sample version of the original. [u]This is fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- The backgrounds clash horribly with the new character models. [u]This is fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n\nThe ONLY positive of this version is that you can skip the introduction to every battle. Except not really, because the option doesn't work half the time.\n\nThanks to the Moguri Mod, it is arguable that this version comes close to the original. Regardless of my opinion though, I'm not about to praise Square Enix for a port that the fans patched up. Moguri Mod is the only reason to buy this game on Steam.\n- Guys literally only want one thing and it's this.\n\npure JRPG nostalgia\n- [h1]Old, but has massive depth of content // Recommended for immersive role-players[/h1]\n\n+ Combat in general, and melee combat in particular, is very polished and open for an older title; everything can be controlled, such as directional blocking, without overcomplicating the mechanics involved\n+ Character creation is meticulously in-depth; initial backstory creation works seamlessly with selection of primary attributes in a way that makes the final product always feel refreshingly unique\n+ 'Story' is about as open-ended as can be, to the point where the game essentially has no story, and is something of a thirteenth century sand-box title; the player has complete, unadulterated freedom\n+ The game encourages the player to recruit and build a personal army as he/she progresses, and the mechanics put in place for doing so are well-rounded and complex\n+ Extremely easy and satisfying to mod; highly recommended\n+ Sorting and commanding one's troops is key, and the player would do well to benefit fromt he excellent command mechanics of the game; strategy is massively important and competently implemented\n+ Economics of the game add another layer of challenge to the game; trade and balancing one's income against one's expenses are both crucial elements to consider\n+ Multiplayer is fairly standard, run-of-the-mill stuff, but it's still densely populated and everything seems to connect well; the charm of the game, and its solid combat system, keep the players coming back in droves after more than five years\n\n- Politics, which are interesting and engaging in scope, end up being a somewhat weaker feature in practice, as NPCs are largely static during negotiations; this does break the immersion slightly, as it seems that your successes are based purely on stats, and not on the actual implications of one's choices\n- Quests often become tedious and repetitive\n- Tutorial is underwheling and largely insufficient to introduce the more in-depth mechanics that will be used outside of combat\n- Visuals are outdated and didn't stand well the test of time; even for the year of release, the textures and polygon counts are well below par\n\n[h1]LockeProposal's Big Day Out[/h1]\n\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/bigdayout#]Community Group[/url]\n[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/7611703/]Curator Page[/url]\n[url=https://www.reddit.com/r/SeriousSteamReviews/]Serious Steam Reviews subReddit[/url]\n- First off, just want to say this isn't a Metroidvania. This is a Zelda clone. And a good one!\n\nI bought this game because I heard it really put stress on you. You have limited time to complete the game and NPCs will begin dying if you aren't fast enough. Pretty crazy, right? Well, I do have a few gripes with that, but let me point out the good stuff first:\n+ Amazing combat. You have access to both guns and swords, but most of your damage will likely come from melee weapons since they have the ability to do an extremely-easy-to-pull-off PARRY! Parrying an enemy stuns it and gives your next attack against it a massive damage multiplier. All enemies, all bosses, and most projectiles are parryable, so this is what combat ends up revolving around. Even though I call it easy, you still get that cool feeling when you walk into an ambush and clear it without taking a hit, so it never gets dull as you go through the game.\n\n+ Good dungeon design. Since this game takes after Zelda, it's not shy about inserting a few puzzles into its dungeons. The overworld as well has quite a few surprising secrets and side quests that you won't be expecting when you play for the first time.\n\n+ Sequence breaks. This is mostly for New Game+ (or New Game Extra, a separate mode where you have access to major exploration items from the start, but not your whole endgame inventory), but it was interesting to find out how many secret paths and shortcuts there were, and how tightly they were managed. The devs thought of everything!\n\nSo now for the bad stuff.\n- Underwhelming story. Guess how much is really explained over the course of this story. If you guessed \"all of it\", you would be completely wrong and here's your dunce hat. Unsighted ends up spending so much of its time on the protagonist's relationships that it fails to answer several of the more important questions concerning the game's backstory. Why was there was a war? Who started it? Where are the humans now? Why are they so disorganized? Why do they seem to have no chain of command whatsoever? How did the automatons ever win anything at all at any point when they seem so extremely outclassed? I guess it doesn't matter. Look, there's two robot-girls kissing.\n\n- Fake pressure. I heard there was going to be pressure before I started the game, so I decided to go DEFCON 1 from the get-go and rush everything. I ended up completing the game in 10 in-game days and I felt pretty good about it. Zero NPC deaths! Zero! I'm a super awesome amazing hero, right? Well, credits roll and... the only achievement I get is the one for beating the game. No one really cares and apparently you're meant to play through multiple times anyway. So... why did I ever care? Why is this mechanic even in the game? All it did was make me shy away from general exploration and side quests since all of those things are less important than, ya know, saving the world. You can call that interesting, but when it has no payoff, it ends up being frustrating.\n\n- No post-game. Did I mention, if you bumrush the game and finish with just hours left on everyone's timers, you don't get to do any extra no-timer exploring afterwards? No, the game's over. Load the save and you get set back to where you were before fighting the final boss. If you want to do any actual exploring, that's what \"Explorer\" mode is for. You know, that mode that makes you feel like you're cheating?\n\nBasically, Unsighted is another game filled with missed opportunities. I recommend this game because the core gameplay and level design is very well done and very well executed, but you should probably know this before you start:\n\nThe only pressure here is the one you imagine. Since the game does nothing to acknowledge your successes, just play it at your own pace and don't be shy about using Explorer. Shame on the devs for hailing the agony of defeat, but not the thrill of victory.\n- Cook a fish; cook a pig; cook a chicken; cook anything you want. Now place a banana on your enemy's stove, and cook their ship. Culinary simulator with cool cosmetics.\n- User agreements are so scummy, I read them and I would sooner pirate this game than play it for free. IM GOING TO DO SOMETHING I CANNOT UNDO IF THIS SHIT DOENST STOP SOON.\n- Wow. Just wow. This is BY FAR the best visual novel i have played. the old school forums and cameras feel very detailed as whenever anything happens in a video chat, no matter how small, the characters react to it. the story was very enthralling and every time i slipped up and made a wrong move, my heart would feel as though it was gonna beat out of my chest. talking to violet felt very real and made the ending that i got so much more satisfying. the only bad things i can even say about this absolute masterpiece is just the fact that most of the really impact full options were locked because \"Emmett isn't cocky enough\" or  \"Emmett isn't compassionate enough\" which felt very vague and confining.\n\noverall the game is absolutely amazing and i wish the devs would come out with a game similar to this because of how good it was.\n9/10\n- Someone has to be the first, I guess.\n\nI don't know, I just didn't really feel too hooked on the game's premise. I feel less like I'm solving a puzzle and more like I'm hitting a pinata for all the clues. Every replay, I'm just going to have to do something whacky in order to get a new clue as to what might further my cause. And that doesn't really make me feel like I'm a part of a story, as much as a I feel like I'm going through an eternally looping monday, getting increasingly distanced to the world around me as I finally end up throwing myself overboard, because 'why not?'.\n\nI won't refund it, because I think the devs have poured a lot of heart into this game and I do think they deserve the money, but I couldn't really find too much entertainment in the game.\n- *puts on hipster cap* Well I have played this before, and let me tell you it is quite the experience.\n\nYume Nikki is a bare-bones surreal game created with RPGMaker. You play as a young girl (Madotsuki, according to the fandom) who refuses to step outside of her bedroom. Besides the dreadfully boring video games in her room, all she can do to entertain herself is to sleep, entering into her dream world. The \"goal\" of the game is to explore her dreams, collecting the various effects and bringing them back to the main nexus.\n\nLittle is known about the creator, and even less is known about the game's story. Yume Nikki lives very much by the philosophy of \"Show, Don't Tell\". There is no dialogue, music is limited to short sound bytes on loop, and the graphics look like something out of the 16-bit era. Despite all of this, Yume Nikki still managed to gather an almost cult-like following; the amount of fan work and theories created for Yume Nikki is truly astounding.\n\nPlenty of games try to capture the beauty and wonder of our dreams, but the reality is they can also be ugly and painful experiences, dredging up our deepest subconscious fears and desires. Yume Nikki refuses to shy away from the dark and the strange, understanding that this what gives our dreams meaning. Like any abstract art piece, it is impossible to place a singular meaning on anything in Yume Nikki. Everyone will interpret and relate to its events differently, and perhaps this is the crux of what let Yume Nikki gather its cult following.\n\nIts greatest strength is also its greatest weakness. The complete lack of direction is not exactly user friendly. This game does not hold your hand. There is no map, so the only way to figure out where to go is to get hopelessly lost many times as you explore the strange worlds behind each nexus door. It will be tempting to simply look up a guide, and I must admit I was guilty of watching a play-through myself for some parts. Indeed, completing the game without looking anything up is an achievement in itself.  However, the game was meant to be played, not watched. The joy (and sometimes terror) of discovery makes the experience worth experiencing. After you've given the game a proper playing, THEN you should look up all the stuff you inevitably missed. Cough cough [spoiler]Uboa[/spoiler] cough cough.\n\nWith that in mind, I humbly offer some advice to make your experience a bit more palatable. Feel free to ignore this if you wish to remain completely spoiler-free.\n\n1) Know the controls! They are not explained very well in the game.\n\nArrow keys: Movement\nZ: Accept; interact with objects (also Enter, Spacebar)\nX: Cancel; open the game menu (also C, V, B, N, Insert)\n1: Use an effect’s ability\n3: Cancel an effect’s ability\n5: Drop an effect on the ground (only in the Nexus)\n9: Pinch yourself to wake up and return to the real world. This one is especially important to remember, as sometimes you may find yourself in a dead-end zone leaving this as your only means of escape.\n\n2) Each time you wake up, make sure to use the desk In the real world to save your progress.\n\n3) Be thorough. Many of the dream worlds are expansive, with few landmarks. However, many of them also warp at each end, meaning if you walk in a straight line you will eventually return to where you started. You can use this to your advantage while mapping out the more expansive zones. Take note of interesting landmarks that you can use for future exploration. It might be helpful to keep some scratch paper handy if you have a bad memory like me.\n\n4) Interact with everything. If you see anything that looks strange or out of place, give it a poke. There are few enemies in the game, and nothing can actually kill you. Sometimes that creepy object might be the ticket to transport you into a new area. Also, try using different effects in different situations. You may find they have useful properties.\n\n5) Search for the bicycle effect first, it will make exploration much easier as it greatly increases your movement speed. You can find the bike effect in [spoiler]the zone behind the right door at the bottom-most side of the nexus[/spoiler]. I will leave locating it to you.\n\n\nWell, what are you waiting for? Give this game a try, you have nothing to lose! Except, maybe your sanity. Eh, you didn't really need that anyway.\n- Probaly the best game ive ever told people to hold back on\n\nIts fun, its rude, it's the best Southpark Game ever made, but its only a 10 to 14 hour game. Its a satisfying 10 hours mind you, i dont think i have played a game in recent memory good enough to hold me the way this game has, the atmosphere and envoriment just puts you right in a long southpark episode, and youll love every minute of it.\n\nSadly, there are not enough minutes of it for $59.99, and thats why i sadly don't recomend this excelent game.\n\nAnd to clarify, its 10 hours if you just take your time enjoying the story, its plausible to 100% this game in under 20 hours, and thats if you are in no hurry, with no game guide.\n- !!!!READ TO THE BOTTOM OR SCROLL!!!!\n       !!!!69 FREE PACKS + MORE CARDS AND COSMETICS CODES!!\n                        \n I did this for the NEW community:)         \n !!MAKE SURE TO UPVOTE AND OR AWARD SO EVERYONE NEW CAN SEE!!\n\ni have played almost all the MTG online iterations, MTG 2012 2013 2014, DUEL, MTGO, Magic the Gathering Online \nTactics, and now Arena. \nMTG 2012-2014 were fun but they were limited to the cards released those years\nMagic the Gathering Online was cool, you could trade and sell cards, do actual cube and draft with bought packs, but the interface was dated even after the update..\nMagic duels was sold to us as the end all, going forward no new program just duels and they would add sets as they released..(It wasn't, they didn't)\n\nMTG Arena (this one) has done everything they said and they did not abandon it after a few years. It may have just arrived on steam but it has been a beta then stand alone client for years (i was accepted into the beta 3/2018 and beta wrapped up 9/25/2019 to give an idea) They are releasing sets and keeping in line with standard releases, they offer a ton of formats and you can earn your cards and decks. i have earned thousands of cards and hundreds and hundreds of packs for free, 1-2 packs per day is easy, and yes it takes time but each month the ladder resets and you work your way up in ranked or you can just play another format or unranked to earn gold/xp,coins which translate into packs, save your gold for drafts and open packs and pick cards or just buy a ton of packs and earn them for free with exp! Also every 6 packs you open you get a choose your own blank rare gold wild card, and every 30 packs a mythic wildcard , also you get blank commons and uncommons in packs and by playing.  and PS there is a ton of people playing all the time, you never have to wait long for a match or even a draft to kick off.\n\n(New Account info and Instructions)\nNew Accounts have to play and complete 5 mini matches to unlock 12 free cards and 5 free starter decks, then upon completion you will enter into the client and see color challenges..skip that, click on the mail icon (top right) to claim 21 free packs (as of writing) from different recent sets, then click the home button (top right) to get out of the color challenge screen to the actual deck builder and match entry\n\nHere is a list of codes that will give you a ton of packs, cards and cosmetics, the packs, also count toward your free rare and mythic wildcard count you get by opening every 6 packs. by opening these you should have enough to craft your own starter decks and even pick quite a few blank rare mythic and common uncommon wild cards ( i just tried to make a new account and i got 69 free packs total that translated to 18 common 25 uncommon 12 rare and 4 mythic wildcards and a ton of actual rares mythics and hundreds of other cards (your mileage may vary depending on how many wildcards you find in the packs as well) \n\n(enter these in the store, top right \"redeem code\" field) \nIM SURE THERE ARE MORE CODES OUT THERE THESE ARE THE ONES I KNOW WORK IN 2023\nFree Booster Pack Codes ( 48 packs from these code alone for a total of 69 with the free mail claims at time of writing)\nPlayBRO\nPlayDMUAlchemy\nPlayDMU\nplayHBG\nPlayAlchemyNewCapenna\nPlaySNC\nPlayNEOAlchemy\nPlayNEO\nPlayVOW\nPlayMID\nPlayDND\nPlayKaldheim\nPlayZendikar\nPLAYM21\nPlayIkoria\nPlayTheros\n\nEXP CODES:\nThreads\t1,000 XP\n\nCOSMETIC CODES:\nFNMATHOME\nInformationIsPower\nCrimeIsAnArtForm\nAlwaysFinishTheJob\nFunIsntFree\nReadTheFinePrint\n:updated:\n\n*REMEMBER TO UPVOTE THIS POST AND SHARE WITH OTHERS, MORE PLAYERS THE BETTER:)*\n- \nWell, after almost a year of not playing this game, I must say, the devs did fix most of my issues. *Most*. Creative mode is fun, but you still need to collect stuff to make things, which is incredibly tedious. On top of that, the character dialogue is still really annoying and you need a NASA computer to play at a stable framerate, but hey, you can actually play without getting your ass beat. I'd like to up my ranking to an 8/10. Very fun, but I highly recommend playing with others. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOG REVIEW (outdated):\nThis game has potential, but unfortunately having fun with it is impossible if you aren't a hardcore survivalist.\n\nCritical Issue #1:\nThe main characters won't stop talking. Everytime you eat or hold the torch they say an unfunny one-liner that makes me want to gouge my eyes out with forks. Even Robin Ayou from Subnautica: Below Zero talked less, and the original game had a silent protaganist. Having characters that have constant dialogue that always repeats is just so annoying to the point where I had to turn off the volume. If the main characters were silent but atleast talked with each other, then I could see potential in that. But they just talk and talk and talk and none of it means anything.\n\nCritical Issue #2:\nThe enemies are way too hard to battle. To make better gear, you need to take on enemies that are so difficult to battle. Maybe you could say I'm just not good at battling enemies in survival games, but I was able to easily battle monsters in Terraria, Minecraft, Subnautica and Raft just fine. When your in-game monsters are too hard to defeat without gear that requires you to battle even MORE monsters, it is not fun, repetitive, and frustrating.\n\nCritical Issue #3:\nThe story is in the background. The fact that the story doesn't impact the game as much as it should is probably the worst aspect of any piece of media out there. The game sends you an a goose chase to find the  main story and it is infuriating. The story itself is all over the place. First it just seems like you need to make yourself grow bigger, but then it goes completely off the rails and into this scientist bunker with a robot that gives you quests, but you can ignore him and continue playing. I don't know if they finished the story, but so far it is not good.\n\nSomewhat Critical Issue:\nThere is no setting to dial back the graphics without lowering the resolution to look like Terraria. I can't see, and it is dumb and brings the whole beautiful vibe of being small down, ironically.\n\nMinor Issues:\nThe music is bland, and although I love electronic/synth music, this is just not it. The fact that you can't have bugs as pets or mounts, or even herd them is extremely upsetting. The farming sucks ass, it gives you 4 items of what you grew every 2 in-game days, when you can just find that item in more abundance at the place where it is located. Under the pond... JESUS CHRIST, the graphics are so bad. The wavy filter looks so bad, and you can see the entire underwater area crystal f**king clear, even though other smaller bodies of water have some kind of murkiness to it. Minor issues like this hold back the game.\n\nAlthough this is still in early access, it feels as if they wasted a lot of potential already. For such a unique world and concept, it never really exploits the amazing and obvious things that it can accomplish. Why not grow your own personal army of ants? Oh sorry, you can pick up eggs but they hatch and they aren't friendly. Why not create a raft made of weed stems and lilypads? Oh sorry, you can just build a base that looks like a boat. Although there are much worse steam games out there, and ones that I have hated more than this, this was sort of a slap to the face. It's not god-awful, and there are a lot of good things about it like the cartoony bug designs and the beautiful graphics, but honestly, it's a 6/10 bordering on a 7, and although many others have enjoyed this, being the super critical demogorgon that I am, this didn't exactly \"ground\" me.\n- I came across Dreamscaper after playing 200 hours of Hades. I was looking for similar games that could recapture some of the magic of discovery and progression that made Hades such a delightful experience.\n\nDreamscaper is not Hades. There probably isn't any game that can measure up to the experience of playing Hades, and there probably won't be for a long while. But a lot of the same elements are there, and I did really enjoy Dreamscaper for what it was.\n\nThe \"story\" in Dreamscaper is more of a personal journey. There aren't really \"events occurring\" so much as a character working through her issues. The supporting characters are fairly interesting, though not quite on par with the literally larger-than-life dynamic personalities of Hades. But to be fair, the characters in Dreamscaper are ordinary folks, not mythological deities.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the game is \"nostalgic.\" It's an exploration of the protagonist's childhood memories, so that makes sense. There is a very different energy here than Hades' cheeky and horny angst. It's more sad and calm.\n\nIn terms of the feel of playing the game, Dreamscaper has a lot of similarities to Hades. There is a varied arsenal of different weapons and abilities, progression through randomized levels with boss fights, a wide selection of permanent character upgrades to purchase using resources gathered during runs, a relationship system to grow closer with the characters, etc. Unlike Hades, every aspect of your loadout can change throughout a run: you can swap out weapons and abilities as you encounter new and better ones along the way. It's both more flexible than Hades and less; you're not locked in to one weapon for the entire run, and there are many more weapons and abilities (and combinations thereof); but with more randomness comes less control, so it's a lot harder to craft and hone a particular build in Dreamscaper than in Hades. A lot of the \"builds\" are elemental damage modifiers, in which all you're trying to do is find a bunch of gear that (say) deals Lightning damage or increases your Lightning damage dealt. The upgrades are largely \"number get bigger,\" and while it can be satisfying to get a bunch of cool multipliers, it does feel less \"combo\"y or \"breakable\" than Hades (though there are certainly some very powerful and broken-feeling builds you can end up with).\n\nThe gameplay is challenging, like Hades, though perhaps slightly less. Like Hades, a lot of your ability to clear rooms and defeat bosses effectively comes from learning their attack patterns and timings. I do wish there were more variety to the enemies, as many of them are just \"the guy from the last level but he is stronger and has more abilities now\" (though that criticism applies to Hades as well). The boss fights are by and large much easier once you learn their patterns, though there are still a few that can be tough for certain builds. The \"hard version\" of bosses are definitely a force to be reckoned with, though.\n\nThe art and music are attractive and inviting. It's much more The Sims than Guilty Gear, but in a way that fits the atmosphere nicely. It's stylized in a very different way than Hades, but it works in its own way.\n\nThe developers are also very community-oriented and are responsive to community input through their Discord. The Hades developers probably are too, but I have no direct experience interacting with them.\n\nSo in conclusion, if you liked Hades because of its horny angst, badass metal riffs, mythological themes, and bloody humor, you may not have much interest in Dreamscaper. But if you liked Hades because of its randomized runs, variety of weapons and builds, feeling of progression, challenging boss fights, and dynamic cast of characters with complicated relationships, then you should absolutely pick up Dreamscaper. And if you didn't like Hades, then you probably stopped reading this review after the first paragraph.\n- Their last privacy agreement update (January 1st, 2021) states they will \"sell\" users information, including name, email and billing address to third party companies (including social media and advertising). There is no other way of playing the game without accepting those terms, very sad practices for a paid game really.\n- The weakest RE since RE6. \n\nFeels half baked as heck on a game design level. Too many damn cutscenes and areas where you're just on rails. Really, the game design seems to take a massive step back from RE7 and even a bigger step back in terms of puzzles. Really a shame.\n\nNot to mention the performance is pretty terrible and inconsistent. Not to mention the lack of full keyboard bindings and support. Really, this port feels like a whole afterthought to a game that already feels like an afterthought.\n\nIt does get better on the back end but not enough to balance out that weak front end.\n- Open world exploration by design, pants soiling horror by incident. Blends the concepts of innate human fear of deep water and unknown danger with constant, all pervading curiosity.\n\nYou have to dive deeper. You have to know what's down there.\n- I read the negative reviews and backlash against DoubleFine, but I thought that I would be OK even if the game had some bugs and wasn't quite finished, so I picked it up anyway. That was a mistake.\n\nThe game is not just unfinished, its in an Alpha state. Which is sad, because I definetly would enjoy the game if it was done. As it is, the game is entertaining for a couple hours, then quickly grows tiresome and frustrating. The bugs are not crippling, but taken as a whole they represent a game that is very unbalanced and grates on you over time. \n\nIf DF-9 ever hits the $5 pile, pick it up. otherwise pass.\n- [h1] Overview [/h1]\nThis is going to be a really long review, so I'm just going to start off with an overview of the whole game. For, one I really enjoyed playing it because of its unique playstyle and interesting storyline. This game kept me engaged the whole time and even though I finished the main storyline, I feel like there is sitll more for me to do. And one last thing, I won't be reviewing Multiplayer here, since I haven't played multiplayer yet.\n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\nThe storyline is definitely a strong point of this game. Rather than giving you evrything from the start, you get thrown into an unknown world with little known about the end of the game and the path that leads to it. You find out more progressively as you search and discover ruins to find ancient relics that give more clues about the past. However, you don't have to explore each area to its fullest potential the first time you enter the game, you can also come back to areas with fast travel (except for at the very end towards the conclusion of the game). The tombs you can raid are also kind of like side quests and the relics that you can find, both inside the tombs and around the map give you insight into the area and the main story. There are also several cut scenes that add onto the story and I thought the experience was a lot more directed than a game such as Skyrim, but it still provides a large amount of freedom.\n\n[h1]Level Design/Graphics [/h1]\nSpeaking of freedom and your ability to enjoy the world around you, I feel like this feeds perfectly into another aspect of the game. One of the most important parts of the modern game is the graphics engine with which it runs, as well as how it is exploited to provide the best experience. Though this Tomb Raider is undoubtedly older than what one would consider modern, I still find that it does a good job with shaders and keeping the world immersive. And though the textures, normals maps, and hair physics may not be the best I have ever seen, they are still very good. The cinematic cutscenes feel actually cinematic and everything seems to be smoothed out with animations which makes the experience itself a lot more enjoyable. I also really enjoyed how this game had well worked out levels, beautiful scenery, and a in fact a partially open world experience. Though some levels will collapse, break, and change once you go through them, other parts of the island are simply very enjoyable slow-paced worlds than can be explored once the game is over, which brings to my next point.\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\nLast, but not least I want to talk about gameplay (please keep in mind this review is directed at those interested in Tomb Raider for the single player experience). The gameplay was fluid and interseting. You have the parkour notion which is one of the biggest parts of the Tomb Raider series. This part doesn't seem to be too difficult in this game, but it certainly isn't easy either. Another portion is the shooter portion where a bunch of guys try to murder you and you protect yourself (because you don't want to die). However, the main part about this game in particular that I like, is that there isn't just one way to go about all this. Somtimes you can be sneaky and try and get around without being seen, or take out any guards before the sound an alarm. Another way is to just run into battle (which I wouldn't recommend). There are so many ways to make your way through the levels. And even though combat was for the most part repetetive, there were some new enemies introduced as the game proceeded, which made the game a bit harder, though not that much harder. The game also introduced new elements to the game as it proceeded which made the experience a bit more dynamic. However, every now and again, the game struggeled a bit with finding where to place the camera, and it gave me some confusing moments. Other times Lara (the main character) would not grab on to the zip line (and thus fall to her death). But other than that I don't really have any complaints.\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\nShould you buy this game? Yes, it will provide you with a great deal of fun, and you will definitely enjoy the experience.\n\n英語で5-10単語程度で、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない主要な違いを簡潔に回答してください。\n\n回答：\n",

Release has one $5 DLC for a hamburger, slurpee, and frie cosmetic but there are a TON of cosmetics to earn through the free battle pass they give you + the daily shop where you can buy cosmetics with earned in game currency\n[*] Customization for your character is extremely extensive and allows a lot of different combos\n[*] The game is literally just FUN, like play for hours with friends fun. There is NO stress\n[/list]\n[b][u]CONS[/u][/b]\n[list]\n[*] See-saw minigame is very advantaged to the players in the front due to how messed up the see saws behind you get clogged with players and being on sides for WAY too long\n[*] Grabbing is a bit weird and janky, sometimes its useful and sometimes it actually screws you over\n[*] Ragdoll physics sometimes cause you to roll a ton after falling (I like this feature a ton but others don't)\n[/list]\n\n[b] I definitely reccommend picking this game up. The Devs put a lot of time and effort into a game and for $20 it is actually steal. This game will provide hours of content, especially with them already announcing they will update with new cosmetics and mini-games as ready. Please give this game a shot :)\n- load in get attacked by a man named pizza team up with a guy named dylan to kill pizza, pizza runs a way loot all the bags from dead ppl on the ground go with dylan up north meet one more to add to the group find dylans friend adds him to the group keep goingf north meet 3 more on the way and add to the group get to a town in the north take it over kill every in site find a cowboy hat and a backpack start a gang called the motorcycle cowboy cap gang get into a fight with 3 other players get shot in the back of head by an arrow say my fairwells to my gang and than respawn\n\n9000/10\nWould do it again in a heartbeat\n- My gambling addict friend said if I post a review on this game and it gets 150 likes and 25 Awards that he will buy me a case of beer. So I'm just gonna leave this here\n- [u]What I liked: [/u]\n[list]\n    [*]The story and characters\n    [*]The creative boss fights and wrench puzzles\n\n[/list]\n[u]What You Need to Know: [/u]\n[list]\n    [*]This game is not a normal metroidvania game that those looking for would like. The game is linear and with some backtracking mostly for optional stuff. The game is heavy on story and you will read A LOT, but you can skip it if you want.\n\n    [*]I’ll start with the gameplay. The simple combat you have is using a normal laser, bomb/missle gun, a heavy laser/swap gun and your wrench to kill or stun enemies. You get these at certain points in the game and as well as upgrades to your wrench to electrify it. This is used mostly in traversal and puzzles, not combat though.\n\n    [*]The game is overall very easy for those looking for a challenge unless you start the new game with one hit mode. The enemies and bosses you encounter are all unique in they look and attack patterns that each requires a different approach to killing them.  With some having to be avoided, stunned or more creative ways to get past them with tools acquired later.\n\n    [*]The bosses are the best part of the game. You have so much creativity in the design of each one that I wish there was a boss rush mode to replay them, minus a few. The developer didn’t make them insanely hard which most people, even me expect when hearing about bosses in games. They aren’t that hard, just require a certain way to defeat with even the annoying or unexplained bosses were still creative like a stealth boss, tag teaming with your companions, and using your wrench that fits and sets the game apart with the design of these bosses\n\n    [*]The game has chests you open for the “light Metroidvania” aspect that you get materials to craft passive abilities that you also find through various ways. This feels like an afterthought as it’s the only thing that makes this game from being just a straight linear game. Nothing wrong with that, but since it’s optional and not fully useful unless trying to 100% and find optional bosses. The abilities are useful, you can have 3 active. Each hit takes the abilities away until you get orbs to heal the slot from doing basic stuff, which in the world isn’t that bad, but during boss fights are worthless. So for me they felt like an afterthought or didn’t want them to be required to progress, which also makes since.\n\n    [*]The story is interesting and I didn’t skip it, it’s a mixed bag on tone though as the game is very heavy on religious and philosophical ideas, which I find interesting. It will get serious and then undercut with an out of place joke or 4th wall breaking reference. The game can also just use a character to preach at times. It felt like totally going against what the character vibe is. This makes the characters not as consistent and makes the characters that are very one simple even more shallow. The 2 most interesting characters were enemy agents that one would preach but that was his character and it fit with who he was and the other was a female that had mixed emotions over what she was doing and hated life. The four main characters didn’t have the same level of depth and at times would get annoying.\n\n    [*]The game does have one entire level and other areas that had elevators that would require so much backtracking to use these properly. Why they don’t have buttons to call elevators to the level your on is so stupid. That one entire level was annoying instead of interesting because of this. They can also not explain how to defeat certain bosses or what to even do.\n\n    [*]Overall the game was a blast to play and seeing this world and its characters, the interesting religious story and showing the many facets of it along with interesting villains. The fact that one guy made all these interesting bosses to fight blows my mind. But even the few mistakes or inconsistency I can’t wait to see what he creates next.\n\n [/list]\n\n[h1]My Score: [/h1]\n[b]B[/b]\n\n[b]Paid: $17[/b]\n[b]Completed in: 17 hours to 100%, even less if not backtracking[/b]\n\nGames similar I recommend: \n[list]\n    [*]Shovel Knight\n    [*]Ori and the Blind Forest\n    [*]The Talos Principle \n    [*]Axiom Verge\n    [*]Looking to try next: Owlboy\n\n [/list]\n- [h1]The Good[/h1]\n- Cop System.\n- Best progression in a need for speed game in years.\n- Genuinely fun and engaging, builds on the foundation of nfs2015 while taking the good mechanics from payback to make a compelling game. If the need for speed hype was still around people would stop asking for most wanted again because want it or not this is it, even if it falls short on a few cases.\n- Feel of \"speed\".\n- Insanely beautiful, runs super well, amazing lighting. Looks good on both day and night.\n- Day and night have different purposes in the game, and the fact you can choose is pretty cool as well. You can sweat if you want or if you want just races you can stay in the day.\n- Visual customization with community decals, let's go!\n- Online entirely optional, is kind of the same as nfs2015 instead of payback having the singleplayer map but instead allowing free roam drivers which is pretty cool\n- Car profiles like we have in forza, no more taking a racing car into the offroad! They actually perform as they should!\n- Good map\n- Crossplay\n- Character customization\n\n[h1]The Bad[/h1]\n- Cop System. It has a lot of rough edges that will piss you off. Yes it's the difficulty players wanted but also too much rubberbanding, \"rhino incoming\" taking half your screen not actually letting you see the rhino, game basically requiring you to abuse ramps because there's no proper way to actually deal with cops, etc.\n- Story is short and shitty. Payback as mid as it was did the \"corrupt cop\" storyline better\n- Progression system is taken back by the included powerful starter cars which came from the deluxe edition. It's fine since it's included but I hate how good features are destroyed with certain executive decisions\n- No post-release support, as it's the case with EA games\n- Need origin to play\n- Lots of bugs\n\n[h1]Neutral[/h1]\n- Overall teenager aesthetic. I like the neon style, but the overall teenager stuff and spanish characters (which are here because of the la casa de papel trend) just don't click with me. I just cringe all over the marketing material and how the characters engage\n- 21:9 support is fine not considering the map which doesn't scale to 21:9 unfortunately\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nThis is it boys. Need for speed is back!\n- This game can be great at times but extremely frustrating most of the time. 80% change to hit, miss every time. I can't keep playing a game with so much crappy coding.\n- This game was a real treat. I played the 1st Valfaris and became an instant fan. I love that this is direction went by the developers, I feel it was a really good evolution of the series and mixing it up with a shoot em up gives it that extra punch/kick/slash. The graphics, characters and bosses are just so awesome and you can feel the grittiness of the mechs. Aside from the awesome game play, the environments and atmosphere has really leveled up. Love the boss destruction sequence as you can feel that accomplishment of kicking its ass. looking forward to Valfaris next installment. Congratulations with this metal AF game!\n- -This game is like the combination of old PC sidescroller like Duke Nukem (pre-3d), NES Contra, and arcade Metal Slug with 80s /90s cyberpunk and action movie tropes.\n-The cheesy humor, plot, and music is top notch. Might look like a shallow nostalgia at a glance but once you played it, they even spiritually nailed the silliness of similar games/story in that era. The guns, the character acting and lines, the costume design, etc.\n-It's not as fast paced as I thought it would be. But actually that makes it relaxing to play. Easy to get into and the challenge is just right for me without being frustrating. \n-I like how the enemies and characters are pretty diverse. \n-I haven't finished the game but I feel like this game will have similar replay value like Streets of Rage 4. Not because of there are many things to do or getting better at the game but because it's somehow just simply tight, fun, and arcadey to replay.\n- [b][i]AMID EVIL[/i] is very much [i]Quake[/i] 1 level design in a [i]Hexen[/i]/[i]Heretic[/i] universe.[/b] It's well done. We're a bit spoiled this year with outstanding '90s FPS shooters. Personally, I prefer both [i]Ion Maiden[/i] and [i]DUSK[/i] over this title for the following reasons:\n\n1) I find [i]AMID EVIL[/i] to be a bit generic in terms of theme; the fantasy setting could use a bit more to set it apart.\n\n2) I prefer real or low fantasy weapons/guns over wands and totally high fantasy weapons. Now, don't get it twisted - I appreciate that these high fantasy weapons exist, but yeah, they leave something to be desired. I miss reloading and all of that. \n\n3) The level design in [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is much more 'sprawling' (for lack of a better term) just like the original [i]Quake[/i]. Most levels are indoors in what feels like an underground compound (at the time of writing this review). I personally like the backwoods feel of [i]DUSK[/i], or the dystopian cityscape of [i]Ion Maiden[/i] far more. I want to look up at the sky in most levels.\n\n4) The enemy design is different than the other two games I mention, which is good - but they all mostly have a 'same' kind of feel. The enemies are all super fast, so most of your efforts are focused on running backwards while fending them off. It's fun, but gunplay isn't quite as fun as the other two games for this particular reason.\n\n5) The font and overall menu system definitely feels 'Early Access'. I know the font is being worked on, which is desperately needed. \n\n6) My favorite way to play the game is Endless mode - and I feel like that's a flaw in itself. It's the opposite for me with [i]DUSK[/i]. I want to fall in love with the campaign, but eh, there isn't really any story or anything all that interesting to suck me in. The secrets are super easy to find compared to the other two games, too.\n\n7) No multiplayer. Now, I really don't care about this - but who designs a game in this genre without building this in from the ground up? You know the community is going to whine about this. Questionable design decision to say the least.\n\n[b]Well, it sounds like I just dumped all over the game.[/b] Please don't get me wrong. [i]AMID EVIL[/i] is a welcome addition to the genre. The *great news* is that this is not just some reskin of [i]DUSK[/i] - it certainly is it's own thing. And that's really important. \n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n+Fairly polished game for Early Access\n+It's the most modern version of the original [i]Quake[/i] we've seen this year\n+Well optimized\n+Lots of content right now\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-The universe is generic\n-No multiplayer\n-The font is too hard to read\n-Music is nothing to write home about\n-The secrets are easy, and there really aren't all that many of them\n-Weapons could use more 'oomph' to them; also we should be able to use the special ability when we want to as opposed to it autotriggering\n\n[b]I was psyched out of my mind for [i]AMID EVIL[/i] - and while it is certainly good - I think I'll be focused more on [i]DUSK[/i] and [i]Ion Maiden[/i].[/b] Because, let's face it, gaming time is valuable and we can't play everything.\n- I vividly remember the moment when I gave up on Fallout 3: I was the ruins of some city, with a grey sky looming over the shredded grey concrete shells of buildings, and vast chunks of broken grey highway was wrapped up against, around, over and under huge chunks of grey concrete. My companion had gotten stuck somewhere in the grey sea of rubble for the umpteenth time, and it just suddenly struck me: This game isn't fun. It's just depressing.\n\nA few years later, I recalled this experience to a friend of mine, and he assured me: \"Fallout 4 isn't grey. It's got colors. And it's good.\" Having banked 1410 hours in game, I would have to say he was right.\n\nIs Fallout 4 good RPG? Nope. The story is rubbish, the characters extremely shallow, and the skill tree is very meh. If you hate VATS, like I do, the skill tree is complete rubbish. Is it good because it is bug free and has good DLC's? Nope. Is it good because it's the best shooter ever? Nope. Fallout 4 is good game because it's fun, and it's fun because it's a decent shooter, with an OK open world, good atmosphere and a sense a humor. Slap some of the 1000's of existing mods on that, and there's a decent chance that the next time you emerge from the elevator of Vault 111, switching to the catchy tunes of Diamond City Radio as you ready your gun and take in the not-grey landscape, you'll be smiling, just like I do.\n\nUpdate: Due to the recent Skyrim \"update\", breaking mods and introducing paid mods, and a similar downgrade being reported as coming for Fallout 4, I can no longer recommend this game, or any other Bethesda product.\n- One of my favorite Final Fantasy games, the story, characters, and setting are just too perfect. The music is amazing and I love the ARPG style combat. I think they did an amazing job of deviating from the standard JRPG with this game.\n\nWhy on earth do I not recommend it then?\n\nBecause the Steam version is BROKEN. The last update Square Enix did gave the game a horrible stutter and memory leak so that the game's extremely painful to play. There's no mod that fixes it like Nier: Automata either. The only way to fix it is to roll back your game version, which means no Ardyn DLC, no Comrades DLC, a bunch of other DLC items get removed, and you're stuck playing an inferior version of the game.\n\nMost developers would fix that ASAP. But Square Enix doesn't understand the PC platform or value their PC gamer customers enough to be bothered with fixing their broken games. I say this as one of the biggest fans of the Final Fantasy franchise there is. I love Final Fantasy from the bottom of my heart. But Square Enix's business practices are unacceptable.\n\nImagine if a car company put out a car and it turned out the brakes didn't work and the car company just said \"Well, we moved our factory staff onto the next product, so you'll just have to drive around without brakes.\"\n\nThat's basically what Square Enix is doing with this game.\n\nFIX YOUR MISTAKE, SQUARE ENIX.\n\nFrom a loyal fan and customer who's bought nearly every Final Fantasy game on multiple platforms.\n- \"it's a puzzle game dressed up as a wargame\"\n\n1. puzzle games don't have this much randomness\n\n2. it uses authentic hex wargame conventions/mechanics so it's more of a puzzle game built out of a wargame\n\n3. you can take the puzzle element out of it by customizing your game.yml file to allow +5 turns, then play each scenario slow\n- Would be nice to get a definitive upgrade rather than paying full price for dragon quest xi definitive version\n- Great game! At times it can get frustrating (boss battles), but the good out weighs the bad by a landslide. Even when i did get mad, which was a lot, I never stayed mad for long. There is just far too much to enjoy about the game. The art style is just simply amazing, the movement of your character around the world is just so satisfying once you get used to it, the puzzles aren't too easy or too hard, and everything in the game just goes together pretty much perfectly. All in all this game is extremely well made. Would recommend buying if you want a super unique experience 11/10\n- This game deserves a more in depth review than it has had yet, so I'll do my best.\n\nBetween the campaign and the puzzles there is some good content that will make you think hard.\nThe Campaign's final battle was suitably epic.  Unfortunately, beating the campaign and trying all of the puzzles and only failing on 2 out of 17 puzzles, both of which I think were bugged, only took me 13.8 hours.  paying the 6 USD sale price for 13.8 hours of good fun, I think I got my money's worth, but I've had better deals. \n\n what would give this endless hours of fun would be if the multiplayer or offline vs. CPU modes were good.  Unfortunately I've tried searching for multiplayer games without being able to find any.  It seems like this game got buried in mass of games being produced nowadays and noone bought it, so unless you have a steam friend you can buy this game for and convince to play it with you or this game shocks everyone with a second wind of sales then multiplayer just isnt going to happen.  Multiplayer also lacks a menu where you could potentialy see what other players games are going on and have an option to observe those games if those players allowed observers into their games.\n\nthe Offline VS. CPU mode didn't impress me either.  This and multiplayer are the only modes where you can build your deck from the full complement of cards in the game.  The Campaign, while fun, doesnt even use a deck in 6 of the 9 missions, and when it does use a deck, your card choices are heavily limited.  Unfortunately, the CPU AI is pretty bad, so I can't realy test what cards are good or bad effectively in the VS. CPU mode.  Another feature I would have liked to see for the VS CPU mode would have been the ability to play with or give the CPU a random deck.  there is no random deck option, you have to pick your opponents deck, so you know what they have.\n\nOne thing that disappointed me from Steam's side is that in the window for \"similar to games I play\" on this game's store page, it didn't list Pox Nora.  This game is infact similar to Pox Nora and less buggy than that game.  Last I played Pox Nora was like 2 years ago though but I have over 390 hours in that game.\n\nOverall I'll give this game a 6.8/10  I wanted to give it a higher score, and I still do reccomend it.  It is good fun and takes a good amount of thinking hard for about 13.8 hours.  Understand that if you do buy it, chances are you probably wont find yourself playing it much longer than that.\n\n- Okay this is a weird situation. I personally don't like this game all that much, but I do still recommend it nonetheless. That's because despite me not being personally huge on it, I can't deny that it is a very well-crafted game that definitely will give people the experience they want if this is the type of game they're looking for. I, turns out, am not part of the crowd that is targeted for said experience. I just found the whole trial and error stealth RTS style of this game to just not be my cup of tea, but again I can't deny its very well-crafted. I also think the art style and voice acting and story are all very well done as well. So yeah, if you're fond of games of this type, then go for it. I'm sure you won't be disappointed. I, for one, don't think I'm entirely sold on it though.\n- Disclaimer: This is review from player who prefer story-rich game and haven't played any game by Arkhouse Telegraph.\n\nThe good:\n+ Outstanding 80's-esque visual pixel artstyle. It reminds me of few SNES/Atari/Gameboy games.\n+ Fairly good soundtrack.\n+ Some cutscene/area have fascinating atmosphere.\n+ Run well with Steam proton, so it's likely this game is playable for Linux/Steam Deck user. Although the platformer area might show too many small detail for 7\" display.\n+ Game OST/artbook is available for free on Arkhouse website.\n\nThe bad:\n- While i understand nature of this game require player to find out most thing and go through trial-and-error, some parts definitely need to be explained better. I refer to lack of autosave (for most part of the game), not letting player know about manual save (you can do it by head left after exit for cylinder elevator until you see display/sign \"< S\" and suggestion to visit block H (where you get some guidance).\n- While the manual say i can play R. U. N. E. 3000 first, i have hard time understanding the story and lore/world building. Conversation such as \"DO? DORODO!\" is mostly gibberish and i only can make vague guess based on few specific term (\"V2\", \"50/50\", etc.) and area i've visited. Short recap of previous games (even it's on the manual) could be really helpful for newcomers.\n\nThe ugly:\n* I experience a bug where i fight boss i'm not supposed to fight yet. In detail, [spoiler] after i exit from P block to get symbol cracking code, i was thrown to G block where i fight G-Cat/10th boss. The worst part is the boss HP bar started with red color and auto 3-60 cannon never perform attack. Fortunately the bug doesn't occur again after i load from manual save.  [/spoiler].\n* The gameplay variation/idea is very interesting, but the execution is mixed bags (more explanation on below paragraph)\n\nSaturn Quest: R. U. N. E. 3000 has lots of gameplay variant/modes (Adventure, Shoot'em up, Platformer and many more) to keep the game fresh. While each area/boss have different reason why it's challenging/difficult, many of those is very unbalanced. For example, [spoiler] Bioplatus M-3D/6th boss [/spoiler] require you to have extraordinary eye-hand coordination and multitasking skill. Among all enemy that resemble boss fight, i only managed to beat 6-7 boss without using cheat.\n\nThis game also has very few checkpoint on each area/boss. On adventure/platformer area, you could restart from beginning after spending 10-20 minutes where you have to avoid same trap or collect same item again. On boss fight, that means you'll need to repeat whole fight most of the time. It's could be annoying because since you're forced to find out boss behavior the hard way or repeating tedious part of the fight.\n\n3 HP and lack of difficulty option could be irritating for most modern player. There are time when i found out i only lose 3-10 HP when i use cheat and beat the boss. If there's easier difficulty where i have 6-10 HP, i could beat more boss by myself. But don't get me wrong, i feel really satisfied each time i beat boss (which i deemed can be beaten with practical amount of effort) without cheat. If the developer bother add easy difficulty which has higher player HP, give more Nana and slightly lower boss HP, far more people could enjoy this unique piece of artwork.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\nWhile i have some rant, it's really unique experience even though i've played few hundred games. In overall, i have more positive sentiment than negative sentiment of this game. But even though i choose \"Yes\" when Steam ask \"Do you recommend this game?\", i'd rather choose \"Neutral\" or \"Information\" instead. If you're fan of 80's game or really like difficult game, you might come to like this game. But for most people, i'd recommend you to seek other game. Although if you really insist to play this game, you could use Cheat Engine and modify HP/Nana using value type Double (also called float64 or 8-byte float).\n\nP.S. I definitely will play the sequel (Episode IV-VI: White Meteor Saga according to the artbook) [b]IF[/b] the developer bother add easy difficulty option and more checkpoint during boss fight/exploration.\n- Their last privacy agreement update (January 1st, 2021) states they will \"sell\" users information, including name, email and billing address to third party companies (including social media and advertising). There is no other way of playing the game without accepting those terms, very sad practices for a paid game really.\n- its a very stressful game and rly hard but the fact that u can lose all ur progress because of a mistake is on another level of insane but in the end if u r determined u will finish it and the feeling when u finish it after all the time is very good i never felt this good in my life about finishing a game or a puzzle its a rly good game i recommend\n- Mixed review, so I will list the good and bad:\n\nGood:\n-Fun to play with friends\n-You have stuff to do for 20+ hours\n-Exploring and survival is done well\n-In creative you can build a pirate ship\n\nBad:\n-Sometimes lag\n-Sometimes trouble locating islands\n-Alone this is boring (sorry shark, you are not enough company)\n-My alpaca named Marcel keeps dying because he refused to eat (fixed now but rip 4 Marcels)\n\nEdit:\n+New engine and rudder added much control\n+New islands are easily explored by one person\n+Lore added\n+Finally you can charge your empty batteries\n+Finally you can too farm honey on your raft\n+Character models to find\n-Biofuel consumption and making is a meh for me\n-If you add saltwater too fast to the filter you lose the empty bottle or cup\n- More broken than Cyberpunk could ever dream. Sure the game has nice graphics but the game play, toxic online players, and poor physics make this one of the most frustrating games I have ever played. Dont even bother using the stable either your game will glitch and youll be stuck looking at you player stuck in the stable and nothing more causing you to reset the game or the rogue horses that will drive by kick you in the face. Good luck if you play.\n- The latest S tier Deckbuilder Roguelike, joining the ranks of Slay the Spire and Monster Train for me. I think that's all that really needs to be said.\n\nIt leans heavily into kiss/curse type effects, if you like the ability to manipulate rng and do some busted stuff with your sequencing you will love it. It is more of a thinker on a turn to turn basis than other games of this genre, but if that isn't a turn off then it's a really solid game with some unique characters/mechanics that feel fresh.\n- I like the game, but I'd recommend waiting for the full release.\nDon't get me wrong, the game is beautiful and it's got great potential. The problem with it is, mostly, the keybindings. They are incredibly uncomfortable to use and you cannot change them.\nPlus, the dialogues sometimes feel never ending and quite pointless.\n- Edited\n\nI Didn’t have high expectations for this game. I read the reviews and expected a mediocre game from ubisoft. I was let down big time. I was given a watered down version of Syndicate that had terrible game mechanics.\n\tAs I navigated the first enemy compound I came across it felt difficult to navigate through the grass and between the buildings. Clearly not developed as a stealth game. Once I had given up on the whole stealth aspect of the mission I was very easily able to slaughter all of the guards in the compound. I trying using the bow but it’s hard to use compared to Tomb Raider and Far Cry Primal’s easy to use bow. Sword combat could have been improved but it wasn’t the worst I’ve seen. No skill required, just click the mouse button rapidly to kill all of the guards in your path. The devs clearly didn’t try that hard because they knew that people would by their game anyways because of Ubisoft and Assassin’s Creed fanboys.\n\tAssassin’s Creed: Origins could’ve been an amazing game that would revolutionize the series but no. The devs had to ruin that possibility by being lazy and making a watered down version of Syndicate. I’ve played Syndicate quite a bit and I thought it was a good game. Don’t get this game for the full price or even for $35. Let’s hope Ubisoft gets their shit together and doesn't fuck up Far Cry 5.\n\nThank you for your time.\n- WHERE ARE MY OG DS FANS OF THIS GAME? REJOICE BRUDDAS!\n\nNo but seriously, I loved this game to DEATH when it first came out on the DS and to now see an HD version of this game on steam. It's quite a whiplash but a good one! To anyone who loves mystery/ detective games, YOU NEED TO GET THIS!!! Good story, soundtrack and gameplay <3 AHHHHHH!!!\n- DO NOT BELIEVE WHAT EVERYONE ELSE IS SAYING. This game is a bloody masterpiece, it just takes the proper skill and knowledge to properly play it. There are proper real life mechanics which are fun as well as true to the real life process of making games. I personally have less than half an hour of experience with this game, showing that this is a captivating game that really draws you in and makes you beg for more. This is one of the games which will definitely be up there for GOTY. winkyface\n- This version comes bundled together with some kind of horrid bloatware called \"Steam\" which functions as a type of DRM meaning you do not actually own the game. Avoid at all costs, buy it on CD instead!\n- Imagine releasing an \"update\" that breaks peoples games/ mods, JUST SO YOU CAN PUT A BANNER AD IN THE MENU FOR BL3. Just WOW.\n- UPDATE: This remains to be one of the best games I have ever played. The company that created the game though... One more launcher that is completely unnecessary. The performance with the 'next-gen' update is horrible. I have half the fps I used to have on the very same rig and that is after going lower with the settings that I used to have. Why did you have to do this b U Ll $I t?\n\n\nThe best way to embrace the true greatness of this game is to look on how the series has improved since the first and the second part of The Witcher. You simply won't find anything that hasn't changed for the better.\n\n- Vast open world that IS NOT randomly created and filled with dull stuff,\n- Story which engages you from the first 10 minutes to the very end,\n- Graphics, even despite the whole controversy of a thing called downgrade, still makes this game THE BEST LOOKING RPG ever created,\n- Soundtrack, it finally goes back to the style presented originally in The Witcher 1, something that makes you forget that's just the video game, it gives you the feeling you are in there, in some village, city or that you are fighting with someone / something, which turns every single battle into an unforgettable memory,\n- Every single side quest, and believe me, there is A LOT of them, is actually a little story that keeps you playing with the same force as the main quests - I call it - a new quality in RPGs,\n- Choices and their impact on the story - even a small choice that seems insignificant at the time can wage on the whole world around you,\n- THIS GAME IS MATURE, finally a game dealing with a lot of subjects which are usually handled very childishly or not at all,\n- Combat - nothing more to add, it's decent, though it's nothing to be praised really, you won't be able to mash buttons and win - you have to dodge, use signs, and on higher difficulties get yourself ready to have an oil for a specific enemy and a bomb to be able to put an end to his or her misery.\n\nThe Witcher 3 is not a game without its flaws, although nothing that can't be fixed - some balance issues, economy basically showing Geralt as a very wealthy person (who he should not be), small performance problems like stuttering in Novigrad and in my opinion very limited after the end content (fixed by the expansions). Many of the things I struggled with have been already fixed and there is no need to disclose them. \n\nAll in all, one of the best games in the last few years (even a decade).\n- its in a forest\n- [h1] Brief summary of why the Chinese players are so pissed: [/h1]\n\nThe reason for the chinese players to absolutely despise the third party modding website is that the \"official modding\" was promised to be released over a year ago, but kept getting delayed. When it finally got released, everyone felt betrayed because it was a garbage third party website with so many restrictions.\n\nBut the reason why the game is still getting review bombed is the [b] developer's initial response [/b] to the first round of complaints. The team was dead silent for about 2 weeks, no comments about all the fiasco, yet people that were complaining about the modding on the chinese forums got their accounts banned left and right. Thats why many resorted to steam review bombing, and almost as soon as the steam review tanked, the developer came out and said the steam workshop will be launching in the end of the month, something he had being saying was \"really hard for the team\" and kept \"facing difficulties\" for the past year.\n\nSo yeah.... I kinda understand why people are still really mad about this one\n- Before you play this, make sure you play these games in order. That is:\n- To the moon\n- Finding Paradise\n- Imposter factory.\n\nAs for this game, it is another gorgeous story that takes you on a journey into the realm of memories. I encourage you to play these games blindly and to read nothing about the story because that's what I did, and I was surely surprised and mindblown. As for the ending of this game, I am still processing it to this day!\n\nI can't wait to play the next game by Freebird Games.\n- Fall Guys had a rough start. Unstable servers and people cheating to win. About a year later I picked it up again and I must say it really has improved a lot. I honestly don't have any issues which cheaters anymore and the servers don't crash on me anymore.\n\nIt's also getting more and more stages to play so it feels refreshing to play a few rounds every day.  The events for certain skins are also really fun. Sure there could still be some improvements like personal usernames or maybe a way to trade in skins you don't want. But I feel like they listen to their community and are aiming to make it as fun as possible. I'm interested to see how Fall Guys will keep evolving!\n- As a Spider-Man fan, this game is a real treat. It was fantastic 4 years ago on release for the PS4, and it's even more fantastic now that it's finally on PC. If you're a Spidey fan, especially one who deeply appreciates the mythos and the message is represents, then this game is 100% for you. The writing, visuals, audio and gameplay are all wonderful, through and through. It's a true labour of love, Insomniac did an incredible job. Bring on the Miles Morales port!\n- It's one of my favorite games of all time, yet I cannot recommend it. And it pains me.\n\nLike many others, I think that the latest update, alpha 17, was a huge step in the wrong direction. Instead of being a zombie-survival game with awesome building mechanics where you could build huge and massive bases, it simply became a zombie-killing grindfest, where bases don’t matter, because zombies chew through concrete like it was nothing.\n\nAlso, don't get me started on the zombie AI. It was fine in alpha 16 and the zombies acted as you would expect; dumb. In alpha 17, the pathing of the AI is just ridiculous, where the zombies are able to estimate the path of least resistance, as if they were not only sapient, but extremely intelligent. This has led to the current base building-meta; mazes and ramps. /facepalm\n\nThe skill system was utterly destroyed as well. In Alpha 16, you could improve cardio by running, you could improve mining-efficiency by, well mining - so on so forth. Now, you just kill zombies to gain exp, get perk points and then spend said perk points. To be fair, they have buffed exp gains from other activities recently, but you still simply gain and spend perk points - yet another horrible downgrade.\n\nAlso, let’s talk about loot. In Alpha 16 you could loot items ranging from quality 1 to 600. Weapons and certain tools had components of individual quality that you could then combine to form said weapon/tool, that would have the average quality level of said parts. The quality would determine the damage/durability of the weapon etc. This system was great and gave an incitement to go out in the world and continue to loot, even if you had, say the AK47, because you could improve it vastly by finding better parts. This has been replaced by a system where all weapons/tools are looted whole in a quality system ranging from 1 to 6. Yes, 1 to 6. Minimal difference in damage/durability, but hey, at least you can attach mods to the weapons now. The amount of mods you can attach are determined by the level of the item. You can now improve the damage of your rifle by painting it in another color. Great…\n\nThe performance of the game… hehehehe. All the new textures and lighting of A17 has brought so many performance issues, and yet again, it used to be just fine in Alpha 16. Don’t bother mentioning it to the devs, they’ll just give you a douchy response about your rig being a potato, even though you’re running with high-end parts. \n\nIn conclusion, no I would not recommend the game. However, you can opt in for playing Alpha 16, which I would recommend – if you can accept that the game might never evolve any further.\n- The core game is fun, and scratches an itch for miniatures combat that I often have.\n\nTwo reasons I don't recommend: \n(i) the single player AI is quite easy once you figure it out.  You can face challenging scenarios but it's because at higher difficulty levels the AI adds sheer weight of numbers. It doesn't get appreciably smarter, so the only challenge you face is how to funnel larger, dumb formations of enemies to come at you.  The campaign mode is just a series of battles against randomly generated forces with extremely thin randomly-generated narrative interludes of about a paragraph in length, with no strategic map, or concepts of supply or resources. It does not meaningfully extend the length of time single player is fun.\n\n(ii) Multiplayer relies on too many things that are opaque to people who have just played single player.  There are a lot of rules and features (like how you get sub-commanders - it comes down to arcane placement of cavalry troops in setup), that are not documented in the rules or in any tutorial.  Unless you are willing to read the forums for both this game and the original game and try to glean this information, you will be perpetually at a disadvantage against the majority of the community who have been playing since the first game.  \n\nIf you like miniatures tabletop gaming and have lots of spare time to devote to the game to learning it in spite of the game not fully explaining its mechanics or giving feedback to you on enemy actions, it will be worthwhile.  Otherwise, the single player experience by itself doesn't warrant buying at full price. Worth it at 50% off.\n- Great gameplay with baaad user experience. There are no tooltips or explanations as to what is going on at all, just kinda gotta figure it out. Otherwise the gameplay is smooth and there's a climb mode called spiral, slay the spire style, very fun. 5 different classes all able to level their decks and get new cards and abilities until lvl 30 I think, got my enchantress to 20 but still more to go. Story mode is more of a tutorial but still interesting.\n- PC version doesn't have rebindable controls for controller for some reason\n\nupdate: i have finished the game, still no rebindable controls, i can give a real review now. i wouldn't rate it negative but i wouldn't rate it positive either. this is a \"eh\" review.\n\nthe game is two games at once and neither of them are great.\n\n the roguelike part is like 20% of the game and is very simple and shallow, there's like 5 weapons and they all play the same, its also super easy. its ok but its not as good as a real roguelike.\n\n the cult building part is 80% of the game and is a bit more fun but past the earlygame its a bit eh too. choosing what you get doesn't really matter since you'll unlock everything pretty fast, and the doctrines 90% of the time are a choice between 2 useless things and 10% of the time a choice between a busted thing and a useless thing. the randomly generated quests the followers give you are just chores like revisiting old dungeons you already completed and the reward is pretty much nothing. its ok but its not as good as a real colony builder.\n\nnone of the systems in either part of the game are particularly deep.\n\nas of the time of this review, the game is still quite glitchy, though being patched by the devs.\n\nthe game is about 15 hours with side content and 18 hours for a completionist run. no real replayability \n\ni'd just recommend you get a full on action roguelike if you want to play a roguelike, or a full on colony builder if you want to play a colony builder. this game does both but is not great at either of them. \n\n game is very cute tho and the soundtrack is great. like 5/10\n- Do you kinda like 4X games, but mostly the first 2-3 hours of the game where you're exploring and hacking a basic civilization out of the wilderness and desperately fending off natural threats while trying to keep people fed and productive? If so, this game is for you. Nice tight gameplay loop where things never get stagnant for too long; always novel threats and opportunities, and you're not tied to any one settlement for very long, so victory and defeat alike are more temporary. Not to mention a really astounding amount of fun, polished content for an early access game! Eremite, Hooded Horse, I salute you.\n- This was released alongside about 10 other big Steam releases around the end of October 2022 and so it is very tempting to joke about how it's better than all of those combined, the real GOTY so on and so forth, as I'm sure has been done already. But what I noticed was that out of all those releases, this one had an emphasis on comedy, which is very difficult to execute successfully in any form of media. There is no voice acting or any high-budget production so how the dialogue and seemingly basic visuals/animations kept me entertained throughout, just like the previous 2 games (from memory) is a tremendous achievement. At a point where I have played a bazillion high-budget action games, and will honestly play a bazillion more, games like this only become more important in showcasing how creative independence is imperative in creating uplifting experiences.\nAfter the prologue, seeing Frog Detective step out of the train and the camera pausing on his full-body shot was akin to, say, if I saw Shepherd step out of the Normany in ME4, or if I saw Keanu step out of a train in John Wick 4, it was really on that level for me.\nThough, I feel like the dance scenes at the end of this game was a step-down from Frog Detective 2 unfortunately, but still good.\n\nEdit: I nominated this game for 'Outstanding Visual Style' Steam Award!\n- [h1] Look at my hours real quick. That's about. 4 hours? [/h1]\n\nFallout 76 is boring. There's no other way to put it. The Core objective of Fallout 76 was to gear the Fallout 4 engine for multiplayer. They succeeded! The art is visually amazing, even down to the 2D art shown all over this store page, so what's wrong?\n\nConsider who's still playing this game. Who's desperate enough to play this game? Well, It's not a lot of people. And they aren't very good people. It's just people. Existing. I had 0 conversations during my 4 hours. \n\nLets talk playing. The game is boring. Since I just mentioned the objective, lets talk about the NPC's ETC. [b] I got this game for free, I cannot emphasize how little this game means to me. It's terrible. [/b] The NPC's & story were not part of core development therefore the game suffers. You get stuck doing some quests you don't care about and play a game you'd rather not play. The NPC's are essential as expected so, you cannot kill them either. \n\nMicrotransactions Via Atomic Shop & Premium plague the game [i] but lets talk about more! [/i] There's free events like a crate dropping & player trading outposts. Wanna know what's wrong here? The game boils down to, find a player trading outpost and buy sh*t, or just dropping crates? well the crates are full of nothing. the games gear-towards premium really gives you nothing in terms of loot so you're playing what is a hollow, unfinished, boring, game. Even in 2021! \n\nCreatures & enemies are cool however there's a big issue of the game not being cool. You may say its worth it to play just to engage the wild-life but even they feel soul-less and void of life. I don't know how you make a game so devoid of soul really. I've met mannequins with more personality than anything I met in Fallout 76. \n\nThe world isn't interesting, it's a barren void forestry area. Sometimes you get a tiny bit of quest, however aside from this game being a complete and utter lore-destroyer for those interested, what it does leave is not good enough to compensate for all of the cons. Honestly, if this was a mod for 4, I'd feel better. But even when getting this for free, I feel scammed.\n\n[b] I'll end this by repeating my hours. 4. At no point was I excited. Enthralled. Interested. I sat for 4 hours, wanting to tear my hair out and scream, because I was so bored. I had tests in school, more interesting than this. The entire 4 hours I spent playing, I wish I had played anything else, & I got this for free! I genuinely wish you the best of help if you end up buying this game. It's horrific. [/b]\n- Oh, that The Resident Evil (The RE)… One of the best stories in the gaming industry! The Capcom is well done that decided to remake games. Many players criticize The RE3, but I understand them, the game is quite short, there are no horror elements in the game. But the game has become easier, for example, a knife does not wear out. The players did not forget to criticize the Nemesis too, saying that there is no element of surprise and persecution, and there’s no sense of the constant presence of someone, who can mutilate you. The Nemesis means in English as “a good script”. However, the game creators tried to convey the atmosphere of The RE and the horror that the doomed city is filled with. Well-chosen actors, excellent voice acting, correctly conveyed the atmosphere of the city. I would add more moving elements on the destroyed streets of the city, like people or zombies\nTotal score: 8.5/10\n- What starts as a simple game of jumping over some spikes quickly becomes something so much more. Geometry dash is like Minecraft. No matter how many times you quit, you always come back to it (as you can see by my 700 hours of playtime). For $3.99 you get such an amazing and memorable experience. This game tests your patience and persistence. It tests your emotions. It encourages you to push yourself, overcoming challenges you once thought impossible.\n\n(SHORT ANSWER)\nGet this game.\n- I really liked the concept of this game of navigating through orbits to collect crates and then successfully landing on the exit.  However, there just isn't enough content to justify it being sold as a complete product, especially at its current price of $6.99.  You see everything there is in the first couple of levels.  No new mechanics are added to the game as you progress.  The developer admits that the game is too simple and the fix was to add artificial difficulty to make the game longer.  For instance, rather than have intuitive controls using toggles, it requires the player to activate thrusters with one hand and turn them off with another.  The level design stops adding anything new and just adds more tedious narrow paths that must be navigated rather than an actual challenge or puzzles.  Finally, the DLC appears to be “pay to win” rather than getting any new content, it just gives the player access to aircraft that should be included already in the game.  By level 9 it is near impossible to progress any further with the default ship as it cannot accelerate fast enough to get through the small orbit and requires purchasing the DLC to advance the level.\n- The best driving simulator, period.\nUnmatched soft-body physics, customization, sounds, graphics - everything in BeamNG is close to perfection - and the game is still in early access! The only feature it lacks is visual customization (liveries, stickers, bodykits etc), but these aren't available in many autosims (looking at you, Assetto Corsa). Lots of quality mods which include cars, maps, and a freaking JATO rocket ensure you'll have hundreds of hours of fun here. Touge, track, drift, rally, time attack, offroad, rock crawling, drag - and with zero level loading screens; just a few seconds to switch your car. Zero DLCs, intuitive interface, and built-in gamepad support are also here. 10/10 worth your time and money.\n\nUpdate v0.24: where negative reviews come from\nAfter the major UI overhaul a lot of negative reviews were posted. Many of those call the game \"literally unplayable\" - which is obviously greatly exaggerated, unlike the other stated problem: lost controller presets. That one is actually unpleasant to deal with (judging from the reviewers' words, since I myself didn't experience a single problem with my DualShock4 nor with the game itself), but yet it was not a force majeure that could not be avoided, as every major update comes after a teaser - which should be a sign for everyone with a custom preset to save or write it down, just in case the update affects it.\n\nTo sum up, BeamNG.drive is still a nearly perfect-rated game - and a lot of the negative reviews are, to put it mildly, unjustified.\n\nUpdate: I love the new Covet.\n- ---{Gameplay}--- \n☑ Try not to get addicted\n☐ Very good\n☐ Good\n☐ Nothing special\n☐ Ehh\n☐ Bad\n☐ Just dont\n\n---{Graphics}---\n☐ Masterpiece\n☑ Beautiful\n☐ Good\n☐ Decent\n☐ Will do\n☐ Bad\n☐ Awful\n☐ Paint.exe\n\n---{Audio}--- \n☐ Eargasm\n☑ Very good\n☐ Good\n☐ Decent\n☐ Not too bad\n☐ Bad\n☐ Earrape\n\n---{Audience}--- \n☐ Kids\n☐ Teens\n☐ Adults\n☑ Everyone\n\n---{PC Requirements}--- \n☐ Check if you can run paint\n☑ Potato\n☐ Decent\n☐ Fast\n☐ Rich boi\n☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{Story}--- \n☑ Doesn't have \n☐ Something isnt nothing I guess\n☐ Not greatly told\n☐ Average\n☐ Good\n☐ Lovely\n☐ Will make you cry or smile alot\n\n---{Difficulity}--- \n☐ Just press a bunch of buttons\n☐ Easy\n☐ Significant brain usage \n☐ Easy to learn / Hard to master\n☐ Not so easy\n☑ Difficult\n☐ Dark Souls\n\n---{Grind}--- \n☐ Nothing\n☐ Only if you care about leaderboards/ranks\n☐ Isnt necessary to progress\n☐ A bit grindy sometimes\n☐ Average grind level\n☐ A bit grindy\n☑ Insanity\n\n---{Game Time}--- \n☐ Long enough for a cup of tea\n☐ Short\n☐ Average\n☐ Long\n☐ Depends on you\n☑ Endless\n\n---{Price}--- \n☑ Just buy it\n☐ Worth the price\n☐ Wait for sale\n☐ Maybe if you have some spare money left\n☐ Not recommended\n☐ Dont throw money into a rubbish bin\n\n---{Bugs/Glitches}--- \n☐ Never had any\n☑ Minor bugs/glitches\n☐ Few bugs/glitches \n☐ Can get annoying\n☐ Ruining the game\n☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs/glitches\n- First, there was Guitar Hero. Now you've got Guitar Nero. \n\nIt's wild that this came out of nowhere, because this is easily one of the best games I've ever played. This is what I've been waiting for rhythm games to be like since Space Channel 5 on Dreamcast.\n- A Visual Novel meets The Stanley Parable by way of Disco Elysium. This game contains a shocking amount of depth of content and thematics behind it's excellent voice acting and 3-colour sketchy visual style. Well worth a play if you're intrigued.\n- Great Remaster, the same for Red alert 2 and Tiberium Sun next please!\n- >Be me\n>Move to new city for job offer\n>Go straight to bed when I arrive, but still oversleep and miss meeting with business contact\n>Have a message, but no contact information, so at suggestion of greasy hotel guy, I start randomly asking people on the street and café if they’re who I’m looking for\n>No luck, but random stranger points me to a club\n>Meet a cool chick who actually doesn’t treat me like a jerk\n>She has a boyfriend\n>Sad feelings\n>She invites me to a cool party anyway\n>Second person I talk to gives me a drink that really messes me up\n>Black out within first half hour of party\n>Wake up at cool chick’s house, she’s on her way to work\n>For some reason when I try to talk to her, I come across as a total stalker type.\n>Go to sleep\n>Next day, watch a train crash over some sort of secret agent\n>Mysterious hooded figure shows up, looms over g-man, then flees\n>Finally, some content, I think\n>Follow mysterious figure\n>Go into store, chase her into the basement\n>Door locks behind her\n>Weird guy there, gives me some backstory I promptly forget\n>Ask him every question that comes to me, but it won’t advance the plot\n>Wander around, not sure what to do\n>Not having fun\n>Meet a cool guy\n>He gives me a hacking device\n>Tells me he’ll teach me how to use it some other time\n>So much waiting\n>Finally run into guy who hired me and told me to move to this town\n>Tells me I’m fired\n>Go back to club\n>See cool chick\n>(only one of two people who actually treats me like a human being)\n>Talk to her\n>She calls me a stalker, I’m not sure why\n>Unable to defend myself\n>Weird basement guy tells me not to worry, invites me to another party\n>All I do is wander around and go to parties\n>Flashbacks of my real 20’s\n>Kill time until party by opening random doors and hacking a frying pan\n>Maybe I started a fire\n>Pass out in front of weird laser gate\n>Did I get electrocuted, or did I just fall asleep?\n>Go back to party\n>Weird guy tells me to loosen up and talk to girls\n>Girls all give me cold shoulder\n>Against better judgement, I drink several beers\n>Carry empties around with me because I can’t set them on counter\n>Weird guy tells me about a test\n>Won’t tell me how to take test, where to take test, or what I need to know to pass test\n>Worst party ever\n>Cool chick shows up again\n>She’s actually happy to see me\n>Try not to sound like stalker, kinda succeed, but I think I’m missing half the conversation\n>Also, I think cool chick might have a drinking problem\n>Me too, I’m staggering around\n>Drink coffee to try and sober up\n>Doesn’t work\n>Not having fun\n>Leave party\n>Kick lamp\n>Go to bed\n>Not tired enough to fall asleep\n>Wander around town, stumbling drunk, at 5 AM\n>Flashbacks to a dark time in my real life\n>Take drugs so time passes faster, flashbacks intensify\n>Talk to strangers since what else am I supposed to do\n>No one wants to talk to me\n>Cringingly accurate simulator of awkward college party years\n>Not fun game\n\nI hear from other reviews that this game starts to pick up after this point, but I can't do it anymore. I've already invested a lot of time and energy into this game for little to no return. I'm not going to study guides and waste more time on this game just so I can dig the nuggets of fun out of this wasted youth simulator. I will say that it did a really good job of making me role-play an awkward alcoholic with no job prospects and zero understanding of how to talk to women, living out of a ****** hotel room. But I've already played the real life version of that, so I can't recommend it. If you want to play a fun game about programming, go with Human Resource Machine. If you want a good role-playing game about hackers, go with Shadowrun. If you want to pay money and spend your leisure time feeling really depressed about your 20's, then I can recommend Else Heart.Break(), but maybe you'd be better off talking to a friend about it instead.\n- Indie games, second worst games after online free java and others.\n\nPro\n- music\n- pixel art\n\nCon\n- pixel art, too old, get on with times, we have enough of this\n- screen is constantly flickering with lines and colors, like interlacing, very bad,\n     put up a warning for epilepsy\n- incomprehensible story, looked up online because i couldn't understand\n    any of the nonsense and bad font system used\n- one hit death\n- no quicksave or checkpoint system\n- unskipable cutscenes, atrocious\n- annoying point's system pop up and can't see the screen full of enemies\n- too many enemies and autoaiming bots\n- last boss is a luck based win, 50 tries, then looked up for help, 20 more tries, win\n- can't see the whole map or at least realistically forward, the enemy is off screen\n    one shooting you, then from the beginning again, waste of my precious time\n- if enemies leave the building you get stuck and can't continue\n     if you didn't kill them they just flee\n- hit detection and object collision problems\n- no difficulty settings\n\n\n2/10 rating.      \n\nDon't pay more than 1$, i got it in a bundle, what a curse among better games.\n\nGlad i got to end credits, no need for answers and bonus levels, no-no, i had enough\n    of this horrid experience, seven and half hours, 30 minutes fun Max, the rest is a repetitive\n      waste of time, my blood pressure got up from this experience.\n- ***NEWBIES*** At least 50%, if not more, of this game is map knowledge. So don't beat yourself up if you're  super lost and everyone is yelling at you over game chat. Just mute the salty people and report them if they TK. Trust me there are a lot of people in the game that will back you up and want to help, so don't let one bad experience make you quit the game for good.\n\nThere are a LOT of maps to learn and a lot of small details in every one. It's going to take the average person until your siege level is at LEAST 50 before you really start recognizing map layouts and details on all maps - including room orientation, call outs, soft wall, hard wall, what should be reinforced in each site, common paths of travel, etc..  And then probably until 75 until you're actually comfortable with most maps and operators. I'll give 15% to your own gun skills, 20% to team work and communication (call outs call outs call outs, people. Don't be that guy that just looks at memes after dying. Unless it's casual.), and 15% to your knowledge of the operators and ability to utilize their gadgets. \n\nMore tips:\n-There are a lot of Diamond/Plat smurfs in newcomer that like to make new accounts and s*** on actual new players because it makes them feel good for some reason, so you're better off playing quick match. \n-To learn maps faster, make your own custom games and run around in them. \n-When you die, make sure you watch the replay so you know what cheeky angle the enemy was holding and then don't do what you did next time, or use it to your advantage when you switch sides. \n-If you're not on cams, watch teammates. Look at the places they check as they sweep rooms. Watch the paths they take. Look at how they engage in gun fights and how they rotate around the map. \n-Spend the extra few dollars to buy a version with some operators - it'll make game play more fun for you and you'll have an easier time finding operators that work best with your play style. \n-Squad up with friends - being able to communicate and laugh in a discord can really improve the game experience, even if it's just one other person.\n-Best way to really understand an operator is to play them, so take advantage when there are siege events that allow you to play whoever you want.

Let's compare w Mario Maker, the most similar game to this one:\n\n[edit: Updated to compare to SMM2 instead of 1]\nWhat Mario Maker 2 Does Better\n- Mario\n- Different themes/gameplay physics across multiple mario games\n- Much larger playerbase\n\nWhat Levelhead Does Better\n- Oh my god the search functionality\n    - Search by creator, difficulty, tags, what's popular, etc.\n    - TL;DR you can find the awesome, and avoid the crap\n- Level discovery\n    - Can actively advertise my levels\n    - Get rewarded for playing people's levels\n- $20\n- Dying doesn't take 12 years to respawn\n- Fun, short campaign to slowly unlock more creative tools after seeing how they are used\n- Local Co-op (or online with Parsec)\n- Leaderboards (if you care, I personally don't)\n\nI cannot stress enough how AMAZING it is to not have to suffer through crap levels. The search functionality is soooo good; as a casual player, it is the sole reason I stopped playing Mario Maker 1. Mario Maker 2 is better, but it still falls terribly short. I think the best part is that Levelhead gives people control over the visibility of their levels, as well as incentives to play other peoples, and that is something that SMM2 unfortunately lacks.\n- Bad game. The story is bad, the graphics are meh, gameplay is bad and there isnt any nudity unlike the first one (to be clear the game doesnt say it has nudity so whatever) but at the end of the day its just a really bad game regardless. I understand that having the mirror name doesnt require nudity but everything is just slapped hastily slapped together to make a finished game. I had really high hopes from the devs of mirror but this was a big letdown as this game has nothing going for it unlike the quality nsfw elements that the first game had as its strong point.\n\nIf you are a weeb and you like the move the slot type games its ok but otherwise no need to play.\n- [h1]Diary: Dandara: Trails of Fear Edition[/h1]\n\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\n\n[table]\n[tr][td][b]Gameplay[/b][/td][td]Quick Gameplay, Interesting Movement Mechanics, Projectile based weapon, helping characters unlocks more paths[/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][b]Story[/b][/td][td]Interesting main story, fun side characters[/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][b]Graphics[/b][/td][td]Nice 2D pixel art[/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][b]Sound[/b][/td][td]Main Menu has nice sound effects, jumping from surface to surface sounds great[/td][/tr]\n[tr][td][b]Controls[/b][/td][td]Great controls, no need to remapping[/td][/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[table]\n[tr][td][h2]Day 1 - 3/23/2020[/h2][/td][/tr]\n[tr][td]I started up this game, not expecting much, and man oh man was I surprised. This game has fascinating gameplay, being able to jump from one surface of salt to another so smoothly and quickly. It makes the game different from others, because the movement and how you go around the map is so different. \n\nThe checkpoint system was a little odd to me. Your progress is still \"saved\" when you trigger a mechanic, it's just that the flag sets your spawn location. So there is no need to fret if you die after doing something important.\n\nI also got to use the stat system a lot today, and man, it reminds me of Dark Souls. If you die, you leave behind your salt, and you have to go back to collect it. Once you do, you can, of course, use it to buy upgrades from the tents for your character. Which is a nice way to choose how you want your character to grow. I like when my healing potions heal a lot, for example, instead of having a lot of base hp right from the start.

These new forced and [b][u]locked[/u][/b] key-binds are extremely biased in favor of [i]right-hand-dominant, able-handed[/i] persons and can not be remapped or swapped. However, as this function has been revoked from PC keyboard/mouse customers, it has been ADDED for console controllers. \n\nCapcom has yet to address or even acknowledge this change.\n\n[b]If you are left-handed, handicapped, or for other reasons require customizable mouse/keyboard functions, Capcom has forcefully revoked the ability for you to play this game anymore.[/b]\n- This HD remake of the PS2/DC classic Rez breathes some new life into a very old gem, however the update only harms its own image due to simple design mistakes and the enhancements that only highlight those mistakes further.\n\nThe PS2 controller made targeting slow and the game was intentionally timed to the slow pace at which you could target enemies. This meant the sound fx and visuals tied to targeting and shooting were all in sync with the music - that's at the core of the Rez experience. However the massively improved VR controls make targeting and shooting VERY fast. As a result all the sound effects and visuals play at once in a cacophony, the enemies die, and then you have a long 4 - 8 beat stretch of nothing as the backing track plods along, waiting for new enemies to spawn.\n\nWhat makes this worse is that the graphic updates end up being largely absent. Enemies filled the middle ground of the scene, captured your attention, and were the source of many particles, effects, the music, and animation - but since they all die quickly you're often left staring at the sky box with nothing happening. Then looking around in VR during these wait periods you can see how empty and simple the levels are because the HD parts are in the effects not the environments.\n\nThis all becomes especially noticeable in Area 5 when you demolish a mini boss and you're left sitting for 2-3 minutes floating through a desolate low-poly void with half the song missing. It feels like the game is broken. They should either have put a limit on the speed at which you can lock-on to enemies (matching to the BPM of the track), added more enemies to match the faster pace of this version, or filled the spaces with stuff to interact with so you can trigger the SFX/VFX where the music and visual upgrades are hiding.\n\nNo new player is going to know that the game is -meant- to be synced to the music and even if they try it is entirely out of sync with itself. This aspect demolishes the intended audio/visual experience which is the point of the entire game. It's very sad to consider how stunning Child of Eden was when it took advantage of the expanded memory, gpu, and peripherals it had available, and it goes to show how much potential has been squandered here. This would have been obvious if it had been properly play tested.\n\nTo add salt to the wound, Area X (the new VR part of the game made for Infinite) failed to work on my Quest 2. I couldn't target anything so I just couldn't play that at all (I hear it's basically just 1 extra 15 min level anyway). Truly disappointing in every way.\n- I didn't want to review this until I was completely done. I've now 100%'d the game. Quite simply, I think everyone should play this game! It's perfect for puzzle players with easy and difficult puzzles, most of which feel very satisfying to solve, has fantastic commentary about all of the perspectives of today's society (it's not just a one-sided view!) and is a genuinely well-crafted game.\n\nMost facets of the game are positive so I have to point out the negatives in the game.\n1: There is no save/load system, it's all automatic checkpoints and you have to go and back up the files manually if you want to see the results of different choices.\n2: The choices you can make, or miss, have some light dialog consequences but they occur over many hours of time. This is something I don't really expect from a puzzle game that used to always tell you \"you can return to any place you want at any time.\" In this game, you can't. The time of day and weather of locations can irrevocably change, the ending itself has some major changes, yet there's no way to see it all without replaying the game (a tough pill to swallow for a puzzle game) or watching the results on YouTube. I'm kinda against that sort of thing unless your game can be played multiple times and be different each time, which this won't be, because it's the same puzzles each time.\n3: The engine is Unreal 5 and it's very unfortunate. Although the game may have been easier to develop for multiple platforms in a faster time via doing this, but it has proven that Croteam's old Serious Engine was a much better engine. Unreal 5 has horrible eye adaptation, anti-aliasing, lighting, and geometry options that are all proven to be horrible via this game. Don't get me wrong, the game runs and looks fine for the most part, but all of it could look better and run better had it been built on any other engine. Yes, *any* other engine. I'd sooner have played this on the Source engine. Epic's Lumen and Nanite technology is still too unproven, early, and crappy to be the generational leap they claim to be. I hope the developer can better tune this stuff so players can have better framerates, less ghosting, better lighting, and eliminated distant object pop-in.\n4: The game's pace at the start and end are worse than they could be. The beginning spends too long (and a lot of later optional dialog depends on your exploration of this) in an open world without puzzles while the end has a final puzzle that includes a frustratingly tedious walk-about aspect that needed to be shortcutted somehow. Everything in between (including the breaks you get back in the open world bit) is perfectly crafted and paced, though.\n\nThese things said, I still insist that if you enjoy any form of puzzle game, like Antichamber or Portal, you play this game. You will enjoy it!\n- [b]HUGE DISCLAIMER[/b]\nThe Steam version of Titanfall 2 STILL REQUIRES ORIGIN. It has NO useful Steam integration whatsoever. It launches the game through Origin, and you can only invite friends through Origin. If you've already got Titanfall 2 on Origin, you may as well skip this. \n\nTHAT SAID\nTitanfall 2 is one of the greatest (if not [i]the[/i] greatest first person shooters of our generation. The game's four years old, I'm not sure I can say anything that hasn't been said before.  The story is short and sweet, and genuinely really really good. The multiplayer is the meat of this game, and it's fantastic. Movement is fast and fun, shooting feels great (I mean, these dudes made Modern Warfare, so), piloting a giant robot is sick as hell.\n\nI don't know what to tell you. If you play FPSs and you've never tried Titanfall 2, you owe it to yourself to buy this game.\n- I played the demo and instantly became enamored. The mix of Slay the Spire-style deck-building with elements of the ship combat from FTL: Faster Than Light is an absolutely fascinating mix, and the \"single-axis\" movement system adds a whole extra layer that I've never seen in anything except the Mega Man: Battle Network series.\n\nI bought the full game within the first hour of being available. After having played for nearly 4 hours at the time of writing, my opinion hasn't changed in the slightest. I already love what's available and so far I feel like I've barely scratched the surface.\n\nI can't wait to see what awaits in the future for this awesome title.\n\nEDIT: As a small addition, I will say: I beat my very first run, which is set to the lowest difficulty (Normal). I jumped up to Hard to try to unlock a new ship, and I haven't been able to beat a run since then. It's probably just that I'm bad, all things considered, but be aware that the changes made with difficulty increases are probably more impactful than they may seem.\n\nAlso I wanna say to the devs: thank you for launching the game with mod support and working on making it easier! But also please look into getting Steam Workshop support if you can!\n- cool game but the font is almost unreadable at times\n- They shadow dropped an update that literally breaks the game and DLC, and for what? Ads.... ads for RS+\n\nNo wonder piracy is the answer in this day and age when stupid business decisions like this are implemented. If I were to write a review a week ago I'd of said yes and recommended this, but this is just another shovel of dirt in the company's deep DEEEEEEEP hole of failures. I'm officially done with Ubisoft because of this. This was a great gateway to learning guitar and even the CDLC made it possible to learn songs that aren't even apart of the + library.\n\nSomeone please get to making a pirated copy of this game with all DLC as that will sell better than anything ubi throws out and it'll be free at that.\n- This is a really clever game; smart and witty dialog, hand drawn graphic-novel style art, and creatively written missions.  I've only played through one set of 7 day missions but there is definitely a desire to go back and try to win in other ways.  In this game you have to manage the resource of your superheroes - not just which ones you think will survive the mission uninjured but to find compatibility and relationships between the superheroes.  There are some contrived bits, some superhero style (groan) humor - but overall this game lets you feel the joy, awkwardness, and humanity of relationships.  I *really* cared about these characters and their trials.  Love is love is love. (Disclaimer - I know Jesse Schell personally, but I don't know the team and I don't feel that relationship influenced my review or appreciation of the game which stands on its own).\n- Ranking based on my \"clicking time\" is an odd designer's choice ... Is it a cheap way to add challenge? Apart from that, the game seems nice. Positive review for now, but it is kinda close call for me ...\n\nI admit, it is so fun to play, however, I have just completed 2 scenarios for the warrior and for the rogue and .. why is it so easy? Is the game goint to get any more difficult?\n\nI have just beaten summer campaign. Still absolutely no challenge. I am hoping for the fall and winter to get more challenging ... \n\nAfter playing for a while ... ranking based on time is the most horrible designers' choice I have seen in turn-based games. I see the point here thought, so WHY DON'T you do it based on NUMBER of turns instead? It makes sense and it would be fun to define decks for more effecient play ... time based, however, adds frustration instead of satisfaction. It doesn't feel like a challenge but rather (sorry for repeating myself) the cheapest way ever to pretend there is a challenge here ..\n\n\nAlso .. Tolerance\n[strike] Suffered 3 or less damage in combat. This achievements seems bugged ... I am fairly sure I have had fights where I suffered no damage at all .. [/strike]\n- Lots of people parrot the \"tech demo\" or \"benchmark of the singularity\" lines without forming their own opinions.\n\nMe personally, as a fan of Supreme Commander, I enjoyed this game more then I thought I would. I only played the single player campaigns and haven't touched multiplayer. \n\nThe gameplay is exactly what it should be for this kind of game. When I first saw this game I didn't like how every unit was a hovering unit, but it makes sense with the class system the game has. Frigates are basically infantry, Cruisers are tanks, Dreadnauts are hero/high tier. The game borrows from Dawn of War with the territory control mechanic.\n- It's a puzzle game about placing toppings onto donuts and delivering them to different areas on the boar. Great vibe and the first few hours are fun, but it gets incredibly repetitive even with the frequent introduction of new mechanics, especially so if you don't click with said mechanics particularly well. If it's on sale, give it a go - you very well might like it much more than I did.\n- theres 2 options with this game, either you play the original without mods wich is still a very good game\nor you have the untitled goose, matt from wii sports, sans undertale, and barack obama fight on top of a mcdonalds\n\n10/10 game\n- Digital Eclipse’s Making of Karateka is a fantastic interactive documentary giving a Criterion Collection quality exploration of a game as well as persevering it to allow people to play it. The collection focuses on Jordan Mechner’s early years in game dev up until the release of Karateka and its ports. The collection is structured in chapters chronologically with each chapter being comprised of timelines that showcase a smorgasbord of information dealing with Mechner’s early works and Karateka. This information includes content such as concept art, magazine articles, interactive viewers that allow you to see how the animation process of Karateka was designed, and present day interviews with people like Mechner, some of the old Broderbund crew who worked on Karateka, and game devs inspired by the game such as Tom Hall and John Tobias. The way this all is structured is really engaging. The interviews dealing with Mechner’s early years are especially charming as he and his dad reminisce how the whole family inspired and worked to help Jordan make Karateka like how his dad dressed up in a karate gi and essentially did the motion capture for the Karateka MC and how he composed the whole soundtrack. Making of Karateka also does a splendid job preserving not only Karateka and two of its most popular ports, but it also has playable prototype builds. It also has previously unreleased games Mechner made before Karateka complete with earlier design builds as well, one of them being Death Bounce, an Asteroids inspired space shooter. There’s just so much clear love and care put in this collection’s creation and it’s truly splendid to see, especially because video game history and preservation isn’t considered as a serious undertaking compared to older artistic mediums such as literature and film. Video games, being the youngest of the mediums, was born in the age of mass corporatization where being a product that sells is considered to be far more important than being of piece of artistic media that should be celebrated. Films managed to emerge right before rampant commercialization happened so they were still able to be considered art that needed to be preserved, but games haven’t been as lucky and tend to just be considered expendable products, especially by major publishers. It’s just so heartening to see something like this exist. I do have one problem when it comes to this whole package though, I think Karateka is just a straight up bad game. \n\nKarateka may have been a technical marvel at the time, as the documentary materials extensively shows, but it has completely aged like milk and is just not a good game to actually play anymore, especially in the present when a vast plethora of games have surpassed it in all regards. It’s slow, clunky, and repetitive, combat is just mainly spamming kick and moving and back forth, the hitbox on the eagle is an absolute pain in the ass, and running is super awkward and can lead to enemies’ one-shotting you if you don’t get into combat stance fast enough. There’s no lives or continues so you just gotta slog through all those boring fights and unskippable cutscenes all over again. I’m admittedly not a big fan of 80’s games, but I can pick up games like Super Mario Bros., Tetris, or Galaga and have fun with them and respect their quality, plus they’re still quite accessible. Karateka is just miserable, to the point I’m surprised people even liked it at the time. Like it’s kinda sad to me the most fun I had with Jordan Mechner’s older games in this collection was his blatant ripoff of Asteroids he made in high school. Similar to my thoughts on Night Dive’s remaster of Rise of the Triad this year, I feel Digital Eclipse gave a gold star treatment polishing to a turd, an influential one, but a turd nonetheless. Digital Eclipse also did their own remasters of Karateka and Death Bounce, they’re more playable but they still don’t really salvage the games at all to me. The Karateka remaster does add the option of giving yourselves extra lives and it does play a little better but it adds the leopard that got the cut from the original game and that section is just awful. The Death Bounce remaster is okay, though I feel the Rover is just kind of bullshit, though arcade space shooters ain’t really my forte.\n\nOverall Making of Karateka is a wonderful documentary and preservation package for a game that has unfortunately not stood the test of time at all. Regardless if you have any interest in video game history I whole-heartedly recommend it. Definitely looking forward to Digital Eclipse possibly making this an entire series and cover games that were influential and actually good, like Doom or Monkey Island. Man, I want a Doom one so bad…\n- + Great developer support.

Let this be a reminder to gamers that no matter how beloved your favorite game studio is, sooner or later they'll have a downfall. \n\nI've been a fan of Dying Light since the first game released in 2015. So it pains me to see one of my favorite series' fall like that with the introduction of microtransactions and garbage live service elements. \n\nThe story in DL2 is somehow worse than the original. While DL1's story was pretty generic, at least it wasn't crap. DL2's story is more generic and all of its characters are absolutely obnoxious (except for Hakon). I don't know why western devs and movie makers think writing obnoxious characters is good. Don't get me wrong, you can write an entertaining character who's obnoxious, but in DL2 they characters are just obnoxious, not entertaining. \n\nThe combat gameplay in DL2 feels off. When you swing your melee weapons sometimes they don't connect with zombies right in front of you when they should. And the gore seems broken. Even with the Gut Feeling update. The gore might look good but it doesn't feel like its actually tied to the combat. For example, you could drop kick a human enemy and somehow all of their hands and legs would rip off after hitting a wall which makes no sense. Somehow DL1's gore is more realistic. With DL2 being a Chinese game now I think the gore might get downgraded later on. \n\nI might be a minority on this one but I never really had any complaints about the parkour. I thought it was a definite improvement over the first game and with the Good Night, Good Luck update they improved it even further. I also don't mind the lack of guns in the game. DL was always focused on melee combat and the lack of guns makes the game more challenging whereas in DL1 nighttime became a joke as soon as you got a powerful shotgun where you could also buy ammo for very cheap instead of it being scarce like in Resident Evil. But being OP and shooting volatiles was still fun in its own way NGL. \n\nSpeaking of night, it's laughable how initially Techland completely nerfed the night time experience just to appeal to casuals. Instead of making the night scarier and more complex in DL2 for the millions of fans of DL1 they thought it was a good idea to appeal to people who dropped the game because they were scared of playing a HORROR game. I'm sure the devs had fun wasting their time reworking a core mechanic of the game months after the game was already out when they could've avoided this altogether if they didn't have the bright idea to remove roaming volatiles. But at least they added them back in and made it similar to how it worked in DL1 though it's not perfect yet. It's BS that volatiles NEED to be hit a certain amount of time before they die now. It feels like artificial difficulty. \n\nTo Techland's credit, they did add a community map creation feature which I think more devs should do for their games. Even if DLC2 sucks and Elyseum is never included in the game, fans can now make their own maps and modes and have fun. I hope they keep expanding on this feature. It's also nice that Techland actually listens to feedback and include requested features as soon as they can. They promised at least 5 years of support and before the buyout it really did seem possible. \n\nI really wanted to love Dying Light 2. And I still do to some extent. But the game fails to live up to the first game even over a year after its release. And after the buyout, I don't think this game will ever do. My hype for DLC2 is almost zero. But that's only because I know almost nothing about the DLC except leaks and rumors as Techland didn't announce anything. I really hope this won't affect the updates Techland makes to change the game for the better but at this point I'm not sure anymore.\n- The game died because the company could not support server costs and its a damn shame because it was a fucking blast.  Why this game died and Dungeon Defenders II lives is a mystery to me.  Please re-release the game with Peer to Peer networking and I will pay $$\n- Minesweeper influenced design feels like a fresh take on the Slay-the-Spire-like genre.  Now that I've won with all six classes, and done some of the unlockable difficulty levels, I feel that I've gotten my money's worth with the game, and I have enjoyed the time I've spent so far, but I don't expect great longevity beyond this point.\n\nI do have some minor gripes:\n\n* The pacing on unlocking new classes feels too slow.  It would be nice if the approach was the fairly standard one of unlocking a new class when you win with the previous one, but here there is a currency which is acquired throughout runs, and I found that I usually had to have two winning runs with the previous class to earn enough currency to unlock a new one.\n* Optimal play with some classes requires memorizing tiles which are revealed, and then on later turns these tiles are hidden.  Taking damage because I misremembered what was hidden behind a tile feels unfun and at-odds with what the game otherwise wants to be.\n* I would prefer if the harder difficulty settings were unlocked from the get-go, rather than grinding through easier difficulty settings to find the challenge.\n\nOtherwise, though, it's a fun game with an adorable art style, and not just a clone of the other Spire-likes around.  Recommended if your expectation is to get ten hours or so of strategic puzzling.\n- In life, failure is as inevitable as success – this is the underlying principle of great puzzle games. You're equipped with all the tools you need to succeed and it's your responsibility to utilize them effectively to achieve the goals set before you.\n\nHUMANITY places you in control of a luminous Shiba Inu, tasked with guiding hordes of people towards a light that transports them into the unknown. The game unfolds like a series of puzzle boxes, each with a fundamental set of rules: shepherd your humans to the light, prevent them from falling from great heights, and use the provided tools to avert their untimely demise. If navigating the crowds from point A to point B wasn't challenging enough, the game rewards your efforts to collect Goldys – the epitome of human accomplishment – which in turn unlock progress and assistive tools for easier puzzle-solving.\n\nInitially, the toolset is simple, with arrows for direction and commands to jump. These rudimentary tools soon amalgamate into a complex web of commands, making the gameplay increasingly intricate. It would be easy to liken HUMANITY to Lemmings, but doing so would disregard the platform challenges that uniquely define this game. As a player, you'll find yourself questioning how to access certain areas of a level to place commands and realizing that the stream of people you're guiding are also instrumental in your own journey.\n\nThe tranquil aesthetics of HUMANITY are a signature of the team behind Tetris Effect, Child of Eden, Lumines, and REZ. Coupled with the pseudo-futuristic techno music, these visuals create an immersive and cohesive experience, reminiscent of an interactive design studio’s portfolio. The game's sleek aesthetics provide a calming backdrop for the perplexing trials that await you.\n\nThe crafting of a good puzzle game demands talented designers capable of devising some of the most challenging levels. HUMANITY embraces this notion by enabling anyone to create and share their levels, ensuring a constant influx of new challenges from the community.\n\nFans of games like Portal, Baba is You, The Witness, or The Talos Principle will find HUMANITY an easy recommendation. As with those games, failure is not a dead end; instead, it forms part of the learning process propelling you towards success.\n\nHUMANITY is a true Goldy of puzzle games. Underneath its engaging gameplay, it communicates a deeper message – one that resonates with its players, and, much like its puzzles, equips you with enough tools to reach your own conclusions.\n\n- tax evasion\nmild aggression\nbullying vegetables\nfun soundtrack\namazing hats \n\ngameplay is amazing and enjoyable, not too short and not too long either with fun little secret things here and there\n10/10 I would play it again on a rainy day with some tea :)\n- Is Duskers a fun game? Yes. Would I recommend it? No, because of one simple reason:\n\nA lack of content with no mod support.\n\nDuskers is a little like No Man's Sky in the sense that the first few hours are filled with fun and wonder, but everything afterwards becomes a disappointment because the game turns out to be far more shallow than it initially seemed. As a player, I yearned to explore more of the randomly generated galaxy in Duskers because I wanted to see what other horrors, mods, and derelict types I would encounter in the empty universe - but in the end, it turned out that there was really very little else to see besides what you find in the first couple of hours. \n\nHere's a quick rundown of where the content was most lacking:\n\n--Enemy types: there's only 4 different enemies. FOUR. They also behave pretty much identically with the exception of the last one.  This was definitely the biggest interest-killer for me. \n\n--Derelict types end up mattering very little. Government A? Salvage C? Military B? It really doesn't change the layout in a particularly noticeable fashion, with the only differences being 1-2 extra ship defense turrets or something like that. \n\nI really, really wanted to give Duskers a thumbs up - I loved the aesthetic, I loved the atmosphere, and I loved the unique command line interface - but unfortunately, after a few hours, I came to realize that there's really just not enough actual content here, and that's heartbreaking for fans of this niche genre like myself.\n\n\n- Remember when you first played Thumper, and you were expecting a rhythm game but got so much more?\nOr when you played Thomas Was Alone, and you somehow fell in love with characters who were literally monochromatic rectangles?\nOr when you got to the final level of Journey, and you nearly cried of amazement at the emotional EXPLOSION AND RELEASE?\nAll those feelings? That is Sayonara Wild Hearts.\n- Nobody will read my review, so i'll just say i'm gay\n- i would say yes there are many bugs especially in the ne update where the cell doors remain open in normal mode and the guards take the new prisoners in the new cells and leave them there handcuffed forever. however this is one of the funnest games iv'e ever bought and it has brought me countless hours of enjoyment, the bugs might be annoying at times but mostly a good restart should do it :). overall i think this game is very worth getting, it lets you play the game how you want to play it and doing so will give you hours of fun as theres always something to do wether its create mor cells or make a execution room. and the mods are great you can really see the creativity in the prisons people have made i would definantly reccomend the checkpoint charlie military prion texture mod too.\n- An Excelent, well polished shmup(except for one technical fault) with great graphics and music.\n\nNot much to say other than it has fun boss fights with some creative bullet patterns, you have a gauge that fills up and when activated it doubles your fire power, and also you have bombs. If you have bombs and you get hit, you lose all of your bombs instead of just dying straight out, so you essentially have 2 hit points. You have a graze meter as well, meaning that if bullets pass by you it fills that meter up, when it is full, all bullets around you are basically nullified, and any enemy you kill, any bullets it fired at you will also get nullified. When you pass through the nullifeid bullets, it will fill the first gauge I mentioned so you can go ape s**t more often.\n\nIt's fairly simple, but the pace of the game takes a little while to get used to, the speed of your ship releative to the bullets is a little too slow but it's not game breaking. The only major issue is that my controller is not detectable by the game so I have to use joytokey, so I can't make full use of my controllers analog controls.\n- If you notice that Kagami voice sounds different, that’s because the guy who voiced him in the first game, Brad Venable, died at the beginning of last year. This time, Kagami is voiced by Austin Lee Mathews, who voiced Roche (Final Fantasy VII Remake) and Ash Carbide (Cold Steel III and IV). \n\nRest In Peace, Brad. We may forget Kaniza’s name, but we won’t forget yours. And thank you for being one of the funniest character in the game.\n- One of the best most fun and addicting all-time games. However, the plants should be nazi's and the zombies should be jews. There is also a hispanic snail in your garden that sleeps on the job.\n- An amazing game, you can go from doing great and having a full and maxed level crew, and end up fighting the wrong guy as they systematically destroy your ship systems leaving your weapons and shields off-line as your crew burns to death while suffocating. Very fun and has endless replayibility\n- Basic game, extremely well done. Like going home and eating your mom's food after decades on the road.\n\nEditing the review to mention some of the flaws of the game:\n- the level design in general is not that great, with every tiny room requiring some mindlessly easy puzzle to be solved first. Eventually it just feels like a chore.\n- not sure if it's something with my steam deck, but I had to put both the game's and the screen's brightness to the max to be able to see things; before that I was constantly missing objects and having trouble with moving around because some soil path looked like a hole in the ground or something.\n- while the game is 2d, there's a lot of different layers of height and depth that get mixed in together and may be hard to tell apart. You often don't know if some platform can be climbed onto or jumped out of until you try to do it.\n- battle system gets repetitive after a while.\n\nDespite those problems, the game is still great and more than make up for those things in other areas.\n- This is trash, I mean if you eat shit for breakfast I'm sure you'll like it.  You have to pay to have access to graphics better than the PS2's, also your stuff gets deleted every week. All there is to do is punch a couple zombies.  Don't get this game.\n- Really overrated. Sure the graphics are fancy schmancy, but in the end it feels more like a dumbed-down Left 4 Dead.\n\nPurely from a gameplay perspective, the class specializations are excessively numerous with not that many differences between many of them (and notably, every class can use the same weapons anyway), and the solo mode sucks (no bots, are you kidding me?).\n\nOn other aspects of the game, there is that XP and (cosmetic) items grinding that seems to be the current trend/cash cow. And the fucking ridiculous buying of weapons and ammo within missions because, you know, killing monsters gives you money and in a world completely wrecked by zombies there are automated weapon stores at every corner - seems legit. Feels like that CSGO crap: it's not an FPS as much as a trading \"game\", where you buy stuff ingame and you buy or sell stuff on the Steam marketplace.\n- Don't let the playtime fool you, I have hundreds of hours of this game on Epic, PS4 and Xbox. Here's the kicker: they actually use Neversoft's old handling code for this remake, so it's exactly as good as you remember it. THPS1+2 has snappy controls, great visuals, the works. Something to thoughtlessly get addicted to, time and time again. \n\nWe'll probably never see a THPS3+4, but cherish this remake, as it shows a great game with great care put into it. It's made by people who really really love the series, and it shows.\n\nGoogle \"THPS Pro\" to get the 3+4 levels into this as a mod, and keep on getting dunked by the pros in Online. The skill ceiling is high, but oh so worth it.\n- This game has (while this review is being written) 10076 reviews. 221 of these reviews are negative. I think this ratio of reviews is deserved and here's why:\n\n- It's a fun story, but not something outstandingly new or anything\n- No one ever can deny that it has an amazing soundtrack\n- The combat is a bit bland, but this is compensated by the fact that the game is pretty short\n- It's a short game, but definitely worth it\n\nOverall: it's just a fun short game to play on a day off. Also, I can't get this soundtrack out of my head! PLEASE SEND HELP!\n- If you want to play D&D but don't have friends, just get this game.\n- THIS REVIEW IS FOR VERSION 1.3 \n\nStarbound is the space game that all people who crave space games like I do will enjoy. \n\nFrom playing with your friends and colonizing an entire star sytem to role playing as a galactic bounty hunter, this game truly offers what all of us enjoy. \n\nPros \n+ Unique art style \n+ Infinite procedurally generated universe \n+ Creative alien races that are completely customizable \n+ Pets unique to each race \n+ A heart wrenching story that [Spoilers] makes you a hero \n+ Crafting system that requires a plethora of materials \n+ Mining and harvesting isn't a grind \n+ Materials can be acquired through pickaxes, drills, mechs, and the infamous and upgradable Matter Manipulator \n+ Devs constantly working to update and add new features \n+ Every planet is different with several contributing features such as weather, temperature, radiation, and colonization \n+ Many different generated structures such as buildings and towns that generate on some of the planets, with origins of each race \n+ An upgrading and advancement tree that takes time and effort that is always enjoyable. Exploration is necessary to advance upon it, is unique to each race, and customizable to each player \n+ Crew members can be added to your ship, but I'll say more later \n+ Your own space station can be created for players and NPCs to visit \n+ You can create and fully cutomize a mech to fly through space and stomp along the ground \n+ You can visit and trade inside of other space stations full of NPCs / other players \n+ You can create colonies for NPCs to live in \n+ Treasures can be discovered pretty much anywhere \n+ Tech can give you powers like dashing, jumping, and morphing into a ball \n+ The bosses get harder and are all quite cleverly created \n+ The quests link into the web of connections that advance your tech, systems, and story \n+ Moddable in any way you like, from the intro scene to Robbie Rotten's clothes \n+ Vehicles such as hover bikes and boats are available. \n+ Port forwarding isn't required to host games, your friends can join you through Steam at any time \n+ Tiny easter eggs and hints from the devs can be found throughout the game \n+ It's fairly cheap price-wise, I mean it's a fourth of No Man's Sky and four hundred times better \n+ The soundtrack is beautiful and has brought tears to my eyes more times than I'd like to admit \n+ So many possibilities that can lead to my 700 plus hours on this game \n\nNeutralities \n~ The universe doesn't feel losslessly empty and gigantic, it's fairly easy to get from star to star \n~ Life is extremely abundant \n~ 2D and pixelated; the graphics aren't 'next gen' \n\nCons \n- You can't customize the exterior of your ship \n- Crew members are a little dumb AI-wise and not extremely useful \n- It's a bit slow paced, which a lot people don't like [strike] because they all are stupid and get bored way too fast and don't have the drive to actually work for anything [/strike] but I love it. \n\nTL;DR \n* It's a great space exporation game with a web of slow-ish paced advancement that's extremeley wide in possibilites and customization.\n* Much of the game is unique, including the races, planets, stars, and generated structures. \n* If you don't like it, you probably don't like space games :p\n- One of the best platformer/Beat-them-up just got upgraded. new attacks, new enemies, new bosses, new levels, new modes, new skins and a graphical improvement, this is really worth getting if you didn't play the original version. if you have the original you get a 66% discount which is good but i still think it should be an optional DLC that sells for 2 Dollars. of course i understand many people won't buy it because they played the original and they shouldn't buy it, but as for me its just that i wanted a reason to replay Guacamelee again so i bought this.\n- WARNING. This game is pure drug. Don't buy unless You have no kids, no wife and You have a lot free time. I mean thousands of hours.\n\nYour brain will turn into a machine calculating the optimal use of all available resources on the map, there are hundreds of them and each discovery brings new threats from the beautiful mother nature. At some point You may experience unexpected dreams about high tech and well tuned factories.\n\nEarly Access in this case means something similar to never ending story. When You think \"I have done everything\" new update shows up and You're starting doing mess again.\n\nI can only have reservations about the multiplayer mode, where there are funny glitches, disappearing objects, self-propelled vehicles, lack of character synchronization, etc. However, this does not prevent having continuous fun in the co-op mode.\n\nI hope You like it so much as I did.\n\nEDIT: Still thinking of buying it? Don't think, just do it. U8 changed a lot, it's now Unreal Engine 5 with Lumen effects, devs are pushing forward to get final product release. Join the party!\n- It's more of a mixed recommendation but the positives outweigh the negatives if you're a returning fan.\n\nEverything in the game that's an adaptation of the original FF7, I love.  It gave me major nostalgia vibes to walk through a gorgeously rendered versions of FF7's environments.  The combat is much more engaging - no more watching a tv show on the side while I button-mash another random encounter.  Many of the big story moments still hit and I found even more to love in the characters based on their performances going beyond text boxes and blocky animations.  Even the music is just top-notch.  The OST will be a mainstay in my playlist for years.  It feels like I'm seeing the old game with fresh eyes and remembering why it made such an impact.\n\nThat said, the new content feels like a filler arc in a beloved anime.  Your character falls into a random hole like 3-4 times, spends 2 hours fighting random baddies, and then walks out like \"right, so back to that thing I was doing.\"  I don't even know if a new player could understand wtf is happening with Sephiroth because he's never really introduced and certain essential events are never explained.  It tries to take some clever left-turns on the plot so returning players have new surprises to enjoy but it often feels pretentious and pointless.  The ending gave me flashbacks to Peter Jackson's Hobbit trilogy because of how unnecessarily forced it was and the sudden cartoon levels of action.\n\nI'm tentatively enthusiastic for the sequel but there's a few troubling signs I hope don't become a trend.\n- I keep seeing all these negative reviews comparing the game to Dark souls, so i'd like to set this straight:\n\nThis. Game. Isn't. Dark. Souls.\n\nIf you play this game like you would a dark souls game you would not have any fun, I know this because I spent the first 30 hours playing it like a Dark souls game and wasn't enjoying it.\nIn order to play this game how it is supposed to be played you need to start investing more in learning combos for your character, different techniques and items to use.  Each weapon has a unique set of combos you can invest in.  When you learn how to use these combos, you'll find that enemies who were infuriating to fight against being defeated much easier and the game becomes more challenging and fun over frustrating.\n\nSummery: This game isn't Dark Souls, So stop playing it like it is Dark souls!\nHighly recommend! \n\n\n\n- This is more than a game for me.  It has become a hobby.  What started as a random purchase for myself last Christmas -- I had an old electric guitar I never played in the closet, so this gave me an excuse to see if I can learn -- has become an expensive obsession for me.  Warning -- but a good warning -- you'll find that you're learning guitar very quickly on this game, and it will become the start of an expensive habit!  I have downloaded hundreds of dollars worth of songs, bought a brand new guitar, I've signed up for music theory and guitar lessons at the local county college ... this has become a genuine hobby for me.  Literally, it is one of those rare games which has genuinely made an impact on my life.  Six months later, and the game has not gotten old.  I look forward to new songs, I laugh when a new chord I've never seen magically appears on the song that I've practiced the hell out and achieved a new difficulty.  The game is, most importantly, fun.  It remains fresh and only gets better as you get better.  I highly recommend.\n- Was a bit turn off when I saw it was a stationary shooter, but the game is so fun I look past that and even began to enjoy the room scaling dodging mechanics (game can make you work up a sweat!).\n\nA must for anyone looking for a more intense arcade shooting experience. I cannot overstate how fun it is to build your weapons in VR, the crafting system works flawlessly and seemely without the need of menus or UIs getting in the way, props for the devs for how well the game integrates with VR controls.\n\nWhat I liked:\n- Varied enemies\n - Great VR controls\n- Gun crafting is addicting and allows for a lot of experimentation\n- Great Bosses\n\nWhat I had trouble with:\n- Makes you wish you could run around the rooms like the original game!\n- The reduced FOV of most VR headsets makes it quite difficult to keep track of enemies that come from multiple directions. Some rooms require so much head movement that I tend to get sick.\n- When a room spawns with multiple shield pylons and a healer bot, it gets extremely frustrating if you have slow moving projectile weapons.\n\nWishes:\n- More gun parts! (Maybe future DLC?)\n- You finally don't need a guide on how to purchase the game.\n\n- 21 different story missions that each take approximately 20 to 50 minutes to complete.\n- DLC sidestory contracts - different targets but same maps.\n- Escalation contracts on those same maps; think of this as a puzzle mode.\n- The new roguelike Freelancer mode that gives randomly generated targets in a randomly generated campaign.\n\nThis game now has such a vast wealth of content that it would take you months to complete it all. I genuinely recommend it.\n- Excellent game, but has an awful-abrupt ending that comes out of nowhere and doesnt make sense and leaves way too many plot elements unexplained.\n\nIn the last game they introduce a secret society of energy sucking vampires that are hunting Rosa and Joey yet they are never mentioned again and instead the end of series villian is some random messed up ghost that randomly has end of the world magic powers.\n\nAwful.\n- Civ 5, Heroes of Might and Magic had a baby together and that baby grew up and had a baby with Endless Space and this baby has now grown up and it is glorious in every level.\n\nIncredibly polished, incredibly neat, incredibly addictive and a game that stands out from the rest. If you like Empire-builders, this game is for you!\n\nIgnore the \"Early access\". This game is ready to be sold. I have only experienced one single bug in this game and the MP works like a clockwork. It's highly optimised, full of features and pretty to look at. I wish more Devs would make their games this way, it warms my heart!\n- Cthulhu Saves Christmas is another solid, fast-paced comedy jrpg from the folks at Zephoyd games. If you're looking for something bite sized, with some funny dialogue (most of it lands) and great combat this is a worthy purchase. I'd estimate an average playtime of 5-8 hours which is a perfect investment for a weekend jrpg.\n\nTLDR: If you enjoyed Cthulhu Saves the World and Cosmic Star Heroine, you're probably going to enjoy this game.\n\n【グループB】\n- Pros \nReally good voice ending.\nCreepy and you are unsure of everything which makes this more interesting.\nDecent story\n\nCons\nEnding just fucks up everything.\n\n\n\"I don't want Pewdiepie making money off my game.\" Im sure you made more money off Pewdiepie for advertising this shi*ty game lol.\n- it's a shame but i honestly cannot recommend this game if you are a disabled person, i wasn't that far into the game when my character started panicking apon seeing a disabled person [person with leg braces] and then gets a \"no good answer\" bit of dialog and all the options are saying something wrong or saying nothing, trying to go with the least bad option aside from saying nothing since i know as a disabled person myself [i'm a wheelchair user] it can be pretty upsetting getting people just randomly stare at me and at least when they say something slightly wrong they are engaging with me as a person, my character then proceeds to talk abt what an \"inspiration\" it is 2 c a disabled person living their life,,, not exaggerating when i say i let my head hit the desk, closed the game and uninstalled, i understand that this is probably put in the game to be a teachable moment for the able bodied audience but ironically in trying to educate about us disabled people they then made the assumption that no disabled people would be playing their game as there is no option to make your character disabled or even to make them remotely aware of disability and ended up just making the experience awful for the disabled gamers they seem to be trying to help\n- [h1]A Great Time [i]Killer[/i][/h1]\n\nSlayaway Camp is an enjoyable puzzle game that runs great and is well polished.  It's intellectually stimulating, humorous, and fun with just a sprinkle of nostalgia.  \n\nThe difficulty curve is perfect.  It is very clear the entire game was well thought out, planned, and implemented.  Kudos!\n\n[h1]System Info & Performance Report[/h1]\n[table]\n   [tr]\n        [td]Operating System[/td]\n        [td]Ubuntu Linux 14.04 x64[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]CPU[/td]\n        [td]AMD FX-8350[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]GPU[/td]\n        [td]GTX 750[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Technical Notes[/td]\n        [td]No crashes[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n- I was a playtester on this game, and I can say with authority, love and joy and care all radiate out of the work that was put into making this game. It still has the same Psychonauts wackiness and great comedy, but it's also become more mature, more understanding, more willing to tackle dark topics head on and acknowledge that human beings are flawed, and need help, and make mistakes, and sometimes even do awful things. But Psychonauts 2 understands that human beings aren't defined by any of this, and that people can learn from their wrongs and can change for the better. And it tells all this through a delicious array of gorgeous, varied mental landscapes, through creative collectibles that reveal the memories, loves, and regrets of the colorful cast, and through a combat and platforming system that is much improved from its predecessor. I can't recommend this game enough. It's an emotional triumph.\n- I'm going to write an honest review for this game since A LOT of people seem to be very biased.\n\nThis is not a perfect game. No 2K basketball game will ever be a perfect game. Does that mean this game is bad? No. Should you hold off on the game for now? Probably.\n\nLet's start with the positives:\n\n- A lot of people seem to gloss over the fact that 2K rehauled a lot of mechanics for this game. Shot meters feel more legitimate, this game is MUCH much more realistic (fouls, shot tendencies, etc...) This game is better and more fluid to control, and the gameplay reflects each players' ratings (defense, shots, etc...) much more accurately.\n\n- Online play seems to be better and more fluid. I've yet to encounter any latency issues online with quick play and the such.\n\n- MyCareer is MUCH better than last years. There is no cheesy story and the cutscenes feel much more integrated into the game. Orange Juice and dynamic duos are a great idea in general. The UI for MyCareer (and the game in general) is so much cleaner and more functional.\n\n- The game is visually beautiful, not much else to say on the matter.\n\nNow, the cons:\n\n- Help defense is broken. It's quite ridiculous that 2K hasn't fixes this lingering issue in such a long time but it's still there. This is a BIG issue in MyCareer and not quite as bad in other modes since you can manually control players.\n\n- Stat allocation is broken. This is a huge issue in MyCareer and has deterred me from playing the mode any more until 2K fixes this issue. Introducing the idea of stats that can only be raised in practice is actually quite a neat idea. However, these boosts are not permanent, even though 2K has stated they are. This is detrimental and demoralizing and discourages players from playing the game more. Limit caps are ridiculously strict as well. 2K NEEDS to fix these issues ASAP.\n\n- Numerous glitches.\n\n- 2K introduced broken mechanics along with the good mechanics. Ankle breakers are now pathetically easy to pull off (using Stephen Curry behind the back moves is a surefire way to have your defender fall). Moving screens are now a thing. \n\nI would hold off on buying this game until 2K patches it. There are just too many issues with the game that prevent it from being a playable game. I like this game. I really do. That's why I'm hoping 2K listens to the community and starts working on the issues at hand immediately.\n- Okay so,\n\nFirst off, the Streaming of the game play yesterday did this title zero favours. Whoever made the decision to allow a copy of the game which was 400 builds behind to be live streamed made a mistake.\n\nThe character creation is a nice touch, makes you think and get involved with it characteristics of the nation you pick to play as. I like this and rarely see stuff like this in game.\n\nThe Steam page states 'SuperPower 3 is tailor-made for all the megalomaniacs out there who are convinced they can do a much better job at running the world than real politicians and military leaders across the globe'. That's a rather bold statement for a game that has 5 or 6 laws you can change for a whole country...., \n\nOverall the game in its current state is incredibly basic and lacks any depth in regards to the actual management and running of a country. No parliaments behind a leader etc, why? Even the excuse of the focus is around you and your characters decisions doesn't make much sense. It takes away the feeling of running a country, that which you are describing in the games description. Where are the ministers, the scandals that come with the running of a country?\n\nThe game isn't a write off, I personally feel it will be good in time but looks to be missing alot. Overall 5/10. Product refunded.\n- Wow. Just wow. This is BY FAR the best visual novel i have played. the old school forums and cameras feel very detailed as whenever anything happens in a video chat, no matter how small, the characters react to it. the story was very enthralling and every time i slipped up and made a wrong move, my heart would feel as though it was gonna beat out of my chest. talking to violet felt very real and made the ending that i got so much more satisfying. the only bad things i can even say about this absolute masterpiece is just the fact that most of the really impact full options were locked because \"Emmett isn't cocky enough\" or  \"Emmett isn't compassionate enough\" which felt very vague and confining.\n\noverall the game is absolutely amazing and i wish the devs would come out with a game similar to this because of how good it was.\n9/10\n- I'm a bit torn on giving Guacamelee! Super Turbo Championship Edition (STCE) a thumbs down, but I feel it's important for prospective buyers/players to know that STCE is significantly worse than Guacamelee! Gold Edition. \n\nSTCE brings a number of modifications to Guacamelee, all of which are negative (apart from the 4P support). First, there are two large new areas, both of which serve as filler, breaking the flow of the game while not introducing any new concepts. Arguably the best part of the second area is the new character that serves as a boss, but said boss fight is relatively simple and the character takes focus away from the stronger original cast. Secondly are the combat changes: the \"rebalancing\" of enemies and the Intenso power. Javiar Jaguar, the stand-out boss from the original game, has been nerfed to an absolute pushover. Moreover, the Intenso power is absolutely game breaking, making every combat encounter in the game a joke. That wouldn't be so bad if you could ignore it, but the developers added certain combat encounters where the difficulty goes through the roof if Intenso isn't used (rooms with multiple enemies with white shields, hitstun-immunity, and/or non-dodgable attacks).  These rooms generally feature Intenso-refilling barrels or enemies as well, so the intention is clear. Of course, there's plenty of Intenso to go around even for easier rooms and bosses, trivializing combat entirely. \n\nIn short, STCE is still a good game, but the original release was a GREAT game, without the broken combat \"rebalancing\" and padding. Please buy/play Guacamelee! Gold instead.\n- I have a serious love/hate relationship with Sea of Thieves. It is both one of the best games I have ever played and one of the most frustrating games I have ever played, all wrapped into one. The gameplay of Sea of Thieves is INCREDIBLE. The sailing is the best in any game I have ever played. The feeling of exploration and discovery as you blast through treasure hunts and puzzles and mysteries is unlike any feeling you can get from any other game. The cooking mechanic, the healing from food, the not-terrible fishing mechanic... all subsystems that prop up the rest of the gameplay are unique and interesting in their own right. The land-based combat is relatively uninspired, yet still satisfying when part of the greater picture that the game presents. Some of my favorite memories in gaming, full stop, come from completing long nights on the high seas or doing long-form content available in the game. The game is gorgeous, some of the best ocean/water graphics in any game. The rest of the game is equally beautiful while perfectly conveying the environment of the map you are in. I swear to Gaben that I can freaking smell the wet sand or sulfurous lava on some of these islands. The music and sound design are some of the best in the industry. Outright, the game is incredible. \n\nBUT... Sea of Thieves sweaties ruin the game for me. There is absolutely nothing worse than having a night full of fun absolutely destroyed by some player who's enjoyment of the game is derived from eliminating anyone else's fun. I understand that PvP is part of the \"pirate life\", but it is by far the worst part of the game by far. I would be willing to pay money, hell a freaking monthly subscription, for the opportunity to play SoT as a strictly PvE game with just my friends and the rest of the server populated by bots. I actively avoid playing the game now because of how many of my last play sessions started with me spawning at an outpost and subsequently being sunk less than 15 feet off the dock by some sweaty that hasn't seen sunlight since the Obama administration. I know that this is an incredibly unpopular opinion in the greater SoT-sphere, but part of the enjoyment of games is letting players enjoy them how they wish, and I really freaking wish that I could enjoy the aspects of SoT that are fun to me without being the plaything of those pirates who live only to ruin the fun of others.\n- Intel Core 2 Quad @2.66GHz\n8GB Memory\nWin 7 64 bit.\nGeforce GTX 680 (X2) SLI\n\nMy CPU is pretty far under minimum requirements, but the game still loads up. The tutorial was releatively lag free. Once I got out in the open, however, the lag was incredibly noticeable. I'm sure I can \"play the game\", everything looks great, but it's clear to me I will be doing everything in slow motion.  Reading other reviewers who have specs above minimum, others are having lag issues as well. I'm hoping it's just a universal patch needed or a new driver update. Either way, I dont regret the purchas. I can still finish the game, it will just take a good buddy or two to hold my hand through the intense stuff...and to revive me.\n- The best war strategy game,, \nI hope in the future they make the similar game (COH3)\nwith modern armies and tanks and modern equipment..\nThey can make USA, British, German, France in one side,,\nand make Russia, China, Iran, and Turkey in another side.\n\nCOH2 Rating Analysis:\nGraphics: 9/10\nGunfires and Explosion: 8/10\nDynamic Weather Effect: 9/10\nAI: 9/10\nUnits and Vehicles: 7/10\n- 5 game difficultys Easy Normal Nemesis Gravewalker Brutal... so whitch one im supposed to play for it to be like the first game(which dident have a difficulkty, jst like awesome games like Gta 4 and assassins creed)???

Like everyone else im experiencing stuttering and the 30 frame rate cap but that is where my cons end. I dont have any special pc rig by any means yet even still i am enjoying this game SO MUCH. The story is so captivating i cant believe it, and the combat system? THE COMBAT SYSTEM IS SO FRICKING AMAZING I CANT BELIEVE IT. I HAVE NEVER FELT MORE LIKE BATMAN THAN I HAVE WHILE PLAYING THIS GAME. I ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE CONSIDERING BUYING THIS GAME AND DO YOU KNOW WHY. BECAUSE YOU'RE BATMAN. THE COMBAT SYSTEM IS INCREDIBLE. THE FLUIDITY OF ALL CONTROLS, INCREDIBLE. AND THE STORY? YEP, YOU GUESSED IT, INCREDIBLE. I CAN'T THANK ROCKSTEADY ENOUGH FOR MAKING THIS MASTERPIECE OF A GAME, IT IS SO ******* AMAZING I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n- I've been waiting since the likes of Planescape Torment and Baldurs Gate 2 for a game to match their sheer perfection, many games came quite close, but Divinity Original Sin just manages to hit so many nails on the head its not funny. It looks great and still plays fine on my aging PC, it has a great storyline, it's two protagonists have some great interactions and dialogue. The voice acting is spot on and it has the most sublime OST.\n\nThe combat is turn-based but do not let this put you off, there are so many choices in combat with the interaction of spells with each other and the environment, that the game just begs you to experiment with different tactics.\n\nThis game just oozes pure class, it was a labour of love for Larian and it shows in every tiny detail of the game.\nIf you like RPG games (or even just pure quality games), you need to play this game, it is the benchmark I will use in comparing other games in future.\n\nWell done Larian.\n- It's a real shame that one of the better games of 2015 was originally released in 1999 and 2003, respectively. \n\nHomeworld Remastered is beautiful. The music and voice acting is still spot on. I found myself re-living all of the excitement and wonder of the original release. \n\nThe only thing missing is the exclusion of Cataclysm (which in my opinion is the better of the three games). Let's hope that Gearbox can find the missing(?) source code for Cataclysm and give us the missing chapter of the saga. \n\nIf you like Real-Time Strategy, well crafted stories and truly challenging gameplay (your tank rush will NOT work here for every mission, you're going to have to really think about what you build, capture or destroy), this blast from the past will sate that hunger. I couldn't recommend this game any higher.\n- Unfortunately Flatout 3 is a big disapointment for me and many fans of previous parts. \nWhat went wrong? \nGameplay has lost this \"catchy\" spirit making this game addicting. Controls has changed and physics as well. You don't have any feeling of the vehicle You driving. The game seems to be at faster pace. Too fast form me :) Too many explosions and destructions out of a good taste. Soundtrack is flat and colorless. It isn't bad but... There is no tracks of some famous rockbands as previously. Graphisc has not made any progress. It has made a step backwards as it stay in place.\n Flatout3 has a lot of game modes some of which are not playable at all. \n\nI like SPEED Mode it has something good :)\n\nThe rest is kind of fun ... for about 5 minutes. There is no career mode :(\n\nTo be honest : Flatout 1 & 2 have their own style and leave in gamers' minds an unique impresion and lots of good, warm memories. FO3 does not...\n- HOW?? WHY?? WHY IS THIS GAME SO GOOD?? IT HAS NO REASON TO BE THIS GOOD WTF?\nThe trailers or advertisements will not even give anything close to a sense on how good this story, build up, characters and mechanics (did I mention the story?) really is.\n\nShu Takumi and Yasumasa Kitagawa, you've done it again, from Ace Attorney to this. I can 100% say if you haven't played this game, you are definitely missing out.\n\n10/10!!!\n- Before I continue writing my review on this game, I got to say that the PC port of Valkyria Chronicles is one of the best, if not, [u]the[/u] best port. The game was originally exclusive for the PlayStation 3 back in 2008. The game was well received, but garnered low sales that would put the sequels Valkyria Chronicles 2 and 3 on the PSP. I actually never heard of this game before until a few week prior to the PC release on November 2014. That said, I will have to give a standing ovation to Sega for putting an effort to make the PC port well optimized in 1080p (or more) at 60 FPS (or more). Sega has my attention and I will present this review.\n \nValkyria Chronicles focuses on Welkin Gunther, a son of a legendary general who fought in the First Europan War, leads a platoon of some adults and teenage volunteers to defend their country against the invading forces of the Imperial Alliance. The game presents a mix of tactical strategy and third-person action that is very unique in the strategy game genre. Does this game deserve your attention? \n\nThe story takes place in a “fictional” European continent where the Second Europan War was fought primarily between the Atlantic Federation (think of all of the European countries, in a geographical sense) versus the Imperial Alliance (Russia, in a geographic sense). Gallia is a “neutral” country where it contains a unique resource known as Ragnite. Thus, the Imperial Alliance invade Gallia to get Ragnite to fuel up their war resources. One of the greatest parts about the game is how well the developers use analogies from World War II into the game and its execution is well-received. The analogies ranged from weapon designs (like the Gallian Scout weapons that look like the Soviet SVT-40 to the Imperial weaponry comparison to the real-life MP40 and STG44, and plenty others). The analogy extends to vehicles and geopolitical conflicts. \n\nThe character developments in the game are highly impressive, particularly with the relationship between Welkin (protagonist) and Alicia Melchiott (deuteragonist). The themes in Valkyria Chronicles consist a good mix of “light” moments (like hope as an example) and “semi-grotesque” themes of war (such as discrimination/racism, personal ambition over soldiers’ lives, and others themes that will unravel later on). Some reviewers criticized the game as being not serious on the themes about war. Honestly, I don’t think that the game is supposed to be depressing and a good mix between “light” and “dark” is best suited for the game. The story starts really slow in the beginning and actually begin to progress as you reach a certain point in the story. The plot is pretty good in most area while few scenes are a bit “awkward” in terms of sudden shifts between a sad event to a “positive motivation”. \n\nThe gameplay in Valkyria Chronicles is turn-based, but it is very unique because once you click on a character to choose, you can actually control the character to move to any location in third-person you like as long you have enough Action Points (basically, the movement bar). Experience points and money are earned by Ranks (like A, B, C, and D) by completing an objective within a certain number of turns (Example: Getting a ‘A’ rank within 3 turns or less to get the maximum amount of exp and money). However, it is possible that you can actually kill all of the enemies on the map, complete the objective, and still get an ‘A’ rank in the majority of missions (except for a few of them). \n\nWith the exp and money, you train your soldiers based on classes Scout, Shocktrooper, Lancer (Anti-Tank/Explosives), Engineers, and Sniper rather than individuals. The money are used up to upgrade weapons, buy tank parts, and purchasing “reports” from a reporter in certain chapters in the story. The game would last you a good 30-50 hours if you play the game in a smart, tactical manner or have an “OCD” on getting an “A” rank on every single mission in the story or a mix of both (like I did). \n\nThe game does have some faults, particularly when it comes to classes. Reviewers argued that Scouts are too overpowered, but in my view, it is best to say that scouts are too reliable since they have the most movement bar and top-tier weapons like the ZM Kar 8 (the game's version of Soviet PTRS-41 that can obliterate any enemy, even medium and heavy tanks if you shoot it in the back). Engineers are useless in the game since you won’t repair your tank very often (depending on your play style) and Scouts are the better alternative. There are some bugs in the game that is related to the monitor refresh rate (if you play it on a 144 Hz monitor like I did) in certain missions in the story. PC controls are a bit awkward when you control the tank. There are a few moments in the story that has some poor “transitions” (an example would be that an upsetting moment happened in the story and all of a sudden, some of the major characters wanted a medal for their part on a major battle in the next cutscene as if that upsetting moment never happen or affected them). \n\nThe game is often compared to XCOM when it comes to gameplay. This may be true, but Valkyria Chronicles is very unique since you can actually control the character in third person instead of the computer doing it for you when you command the character to move from Point A to B, in bird’s eye view. The game engine is very aesthetic and presents the story very well. I’m glad the Sega released Valkyria Chronicles to the PC and I am very pleased to hear that a (possible) new Valkyria Chronicles game is being trademarked (and hopefully in development) thanks to the PC sales. The default price of $20 is a good deal, -50% off is a great deal, -75% is a perfect steal. Valkyria Chronicles is one of my top games for 2014 due to its unique strategy gameplay and superb PC port optimization. I am looking forward for the new game that is being trademarked (or possible PC ports or revamp for VC2 and 3). This game has my highest recommendation for any strategy gamer who want to find something original, unique, and beautiful.\n- This is a story about relationships.\nThis is a story about opposites.\nThis is a story about reflections.\nThis is a story about redemption.\nThis is a story about damnation.\nThis is a story about reconciliation.\nThis is a story about gods.\nThis is a story about paradoxes.\nThis is a story about love.\nThis is a story about hate.\nThis is a story about life.\nThis is a story about death.\nThis is a story about forgiveness.\nThis is a story about condemnation.\nThis is a story about time and time loops.\nThis is a story about multiverse theory.\nThis is a story about murder.\nThis is a story about betrayal.\nThis is a story about trust.\nThis is a story about freedom.\nThis is a story about happiness.\nThis is a story about sadness.\nThis is a story about boredom.\nThis is a story about a Princess.\nThis is a story about what looks like a Frog at one point.\n\nThis is a story about everything and nothing.

I don’t know if the dev has clarified on this, but it’s my interpretation of the protagonist anyway. \n    • Creative game mechanics. The player erases entire scenes away or journal entries, then later, can write (choose where written words appear).\n    • Extremely stylized. It’s simple art, but the presentation and coloration of it makes it very unique. \n    • Lots of Irish terms and slang to learn. There’s even a glossary. There’s also an amusing achievement for playing the game in Irish. \n    • Speaking of languages, there are 12 languages available for the game!\n    • Encourages people to seek out help from those who are willing to give it. \n\n[u]Complaints[/u]\n    • “Making Memories Disappear” achievement.

It's a well put together survival game with many things to do. Whether you want to just build a sandbox wilderness empire or try to escape, it's entirely fun no matter what. I've tried to actually complete the game, but I always end up building a massive epic fortress complete with my very own beefalo farm. The only thing that I personally don't like about this game is the stumble-upon style of actually completing the quests (they're not really quests, but I can't think of anything else to call them). Other than that, this game is a beautiful masterpiece. Very artistic, creative and fun. I definitely recommend it to anyone who loves survival games of any sort.\n- PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE VENTURING INTO 999!\n\n\n\nI refunded the game thinking they removed so much of the narrative but I was wrong, the game has now 2 different types of screens, the \"ADV screen\" and the \"Novel screen\". Make sure you switch to \"Novel screen\" as soon as you start playing and stay on that screen as the \"ADV screen\" only displays dialogue and NOTHING ELSE, if you stay on this screen you'll miss all the extra bits that can help to figure out certain details that allow you to find all the endings and figure out the entire story top to bottom.\nHappy gaming.\n\nEDIT: @Snivader pointed out my mistake, edited the review.\n\n\n\nExtra small tip to help you through your journey. Take a notepad (or anything you can scribble down onto), and write down key dates / codes / people that you encounter through the game and keep them close while playing the entire trilogy. I can guarantee you that your mind will be blown by the end of the trilogy (provided you can keep up with the weird events that go down in these games).\n- I came across Dreamscaper after playing 200 hours of Hades. I was looking for similar games that could recapture some of the magic of discovery and progression that made Hades such a delightful experience.\n\nDreamscaper is not Hades. There probably isn't any game that can measure up to the experience of playing Hades, and there probably won't be for a long while. But a lot of the same elements are there, and I did really enjoy Dreamscaper for what it was.\n\nThe \"story\" in Dreamscaper is more of a personal journey. There aren't really \"events occurring\" so much as a character working through her issues. The supporting characters are fairly interesting, though not quite on par with the literally larger-than-life dynamic personalities of Hades. But to be fair, the characters in Dreamscaper are ordinary folks, not mythological deities.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the game is \"nostalgic.\" It's an exploration of the protagonist's childhood memories, so that makes sense. There is a very different energy here than Hades' cheeky and horny angst. It's more sad and calm.\n\nIn terms of the feel of playing the game, Dreamscaper has a lot of similarities to Hades. There is a varied arsenal of different weapons and abilities, progression through randomized levels with boss fights, a wide selection of permanent character upgrades to purchase using resources gathered during runs, a relationship system to grow closer with the characters, etc. Unlike Hades, every aspect of your loadout can change throughout a run: you can swap out weapons and abilities as you encounter new and better ones along the way. It's both more flexible than Hades and less; you're not locked in to one weapon for the entire run, and there are many more weapons and abilities (and combinations thereof); but with more randomness comes less control, so it's a lot harder to craft and hone a particular build in Dreamscaper than in Hades. A lot of the \"builds\" are elemental damage modifiers, in which all you're trying to do is find a bunch of gear that (say) deals Lightning damage or increases your Lightning damage dealt. The upgrades are largely \"number get bigger,\" and while it can be satisfying to get a bunch of cool multipliers, it does feel less \"combo\"y or \"breakable\" than Hades (though there are certainly some very powerful and broken-feeling builds you can end up with).\n\nThe gameplay is challenging, like Hades, though perhaps slightly less. Like Hades, a lot of your ability to clear rooms and defeat bosses effectively comes from learning their attack patterns and timings. I do wish there were more variety to the enemies, as many of them are just \"the guy from the last level but he is stronger and has more abilities now\" (though that criticism applies to Hades as well). The boss fights are by and large much easier once you learn their patterns, though there are still a few that can be tough for certain builds. The \"hard version\" of bosses are definitely a force to be reckoned with, though.\n\nThe art and music are attractive and inviting. It's much more The Sims than Guilty Gear, but in a way that fits the atmosphere nicely. It's stylized in a very different way than Hades, but it works in its own way.\n\nThe developers are also very community-oriented and are responsive to community input through their Discord. The Hades developers probably are too, but I have no direct experience interacting with them.\n\nSo in conclusion, if you liked Hades because of its horny angst, badass metal riffs, mythological themes, and bloody humor, you may not have much interest in Dreamscaper. But if you liked Hades because of its randomized runs, variety of weapons and builds, feeling of progression, challenging boss fights, and dynamic cast of characters with complicated relationships, then you should absolutely pick up Dreamscaper. And if you didn't like Hades, then you probably stopped reading this review after the first paragraph.\n- I like this game because it is so relaxing. It has a great mix of monsters in it. You are not frighting monsters  all the time. I give this game a 5 star rating. I wish thee was a Dragon Quest Builder;s 3.\n- Dave the Diver is a charming little 'Indie'* that still surprises you with new mechanics even hours in. The various activity cutscenes are pretty funny as well.\n\nJust a word of warning though. Mintrocket is NOT a indie studio, it's a subsidiary of NEXON, so DtD is entirely a NEXON game, and with how their reputation is it's pretty understandable to not buy this game just because of that.\n- In terms of originality, this gets a zero.  It's a Robotron clone with pretty graphics.  There have been many of these, and my personal favourite is the original Mutant Storm which is sadly no longer available to buy.  However, the graphics are really really pretty, and the game play is really really good.  So for being the best implementation of the Robotron idea to date it gets a big thumbs up!\n\nSuggestions where it could be improved:\n[list]\n    [*]Graphics are so pretty they do sometimes make it hard to see what's going on.  Maybe have a less pretty looking mode.\n    [*]4 player co-op\n    [*]Online co-op\n    [*]Ability to save/pause arcade mode so you don't have to play through entire game in single session.\n[/list]\n- I would recommend ARK only in 1 specific case – you have a group of friends and will play on a private/local server. You get to enjoy the game at your own pace, with modified server multipliers, without the worry of PvP and server-dominating tribes. Graphics are great, the world is beautiful, lots of cool dinos to tame. There’s a lot to do, to build, to explore, to figure out.\n\nBut playing on a large PvP server is horrible experience. You are at a mercy of alpha tribes that have everything and can do anything. Slow progression, server wipes, laggy combat, so much grinding to catch up just to have your base destroyed while offline. Maybe you could find some servers where all this is more balanced but even then, it just becomes a game of who can grind more. It’s just not something I would ever recommend.\n- came for the cleaning mechanics and total lack of privacy, stayed for the secret lesbian love affairs\n- Are you looking for a medival game with great design and clever AI? Well then! ...keep looking. Just stop and turn around. I am serious. I know my \"game time\" says what? 10min? But its at least 2-3hours. \n\nI just sat there, trying to figure out what the heck I was supposed to do. Such as resources... why arent my people doing what I tell them to? My people just stand there and does nothing when i tell them to do something. \n\n\nIts like the developers decided \"meh, lets release and hope stupid people buy it so we can break even on this project\" becouse that attitude reflects how the game is. \n\n\nSave your money, walk away and spend them on something else. Litterly anything else...\n- This is easily one of the funniest games I played in 2017.  In the 20 hours it took me to solve it the first time, I pretty much did nothing else until I had finished it, despite the fact that I was supposed to be studying.\n\nThe game is set in absurd western themed world where humour is so baked into the fabric of everything that there is virtually nothing that isn't some kind of joke.  This could easily fall flat if it were poorly written, but I found the writing to be fantastic.  Obviouslly humour is subjective so if you aren't onboard with it's humour you proably won't get much out of it.  For everyone else you are due for a hell of a ride as the game is an absolute hoot.\n\nThe game takes place in a kind of openinsh world with your character setting out from a location on their horse. You can either select to \"Wander\" in which case you will make a broad loop out and around, potentially unovering new map locations or encountering a random encounter.  You can also direct travel to locations you have found and will also be told about map locations from NPC's or as the outcomes of various quests.    The world is feels quite expansive with a lot of interesting locations to explore.  There are a couple of central plot quests to pursue and a bunch of side quests as well.  In my 20 hour playthrough I managed to complete the main story but still had a few side things Id managed to miss all the clues for.\n\nCombat in the game takes place in a turn based format that should feel familiar to anyone has played a JRPG before.  You stand on one side, your foes tand on the other and you select your various attacks and abilities from a list specific to each characters class.  As you gain XP  you can choose what skills you buy so you can tailor your character to your play style, with higher skill levels costing increasing amounts of XP.  You can further personalise your character with a swathe of various equiment, almost all of which is humorous and absurd.  The combat is not particularly complex but its good enough and the humour is so good that it really does the heavy lifting for keeping you engaged.\n\nAs you can see from the screenshots the graphics portray everything in stick figures, but everything is surpisingly detailed and the great animation and the little touches really add to the charm of world.  A still screenshot doesn't really do justice to how much fun this game is to see in motion.\n\nThe music and sound are suprisingly good too, with twangy guitars and banjos mixed with good old time whistling and other wild west sounding stuffness.  Once again is better than you have any right to expect from such an overtly daft title and between the lively graphics and relelentless humour It's just another layer of polish to draw you into the games odd version of the wild west.\n\nLook I flat out loved this game. It was a delight. As I said, your milage may vary if the humour doesn't tickle your funny bone but I can tell you now, never have I laughed so hard at a game as I did digging through the spitoons in West of Loathing.\n\nGold.\n\n9 out of 10\n- [h1] Look at my hours real quick. That's about. 4 hours? [/h1]\n\nFallout 76 is boring. There's no other way to put it. The Core objective of Fallout 76 was to gear the Fallout 4 engine for multiplayer. They succeeded! The art is visually amazing, even down to the 2D art shown all over this store page, so what's wrong?\n\nConsider who's still playing this game. Who's desperate enough to play this game? Well, It's not a lot of people. And they aren't very good people. It's just people. Existing. I had 0 conversations during my 4 hours. \n\nLets talk playing. The game is boring. Since I just mentioned the objective, lets talk about the NPC's ETC. [b] I got this game for free, I cannot emphasize how little this game means to me. It's terrible. [/b] The NPC's & story were not part of core development therefore the game suffers. You get stuck doing some quests you don't care about and play a game you'd rather not play. The NPC's are essential as expected so, you cannot kill them either. \n\nMicrotransactions Via Atomic Shop & Premium plague the game [i] but lets talk about more! [/i] There's free events like a crate dropping & player trading outposts. Wanna know what's wrong here? The game boils down to, find a player trading outpost and buy sh*t, or just dropping crates? well the crates are full of nothing. the games gear-towards premium really gives you nothing in terms of loot so you're playing what is a hollow, unfinished, boring, game. Even in 2021! \n\nCreatures & enemies are cool however there's a big issue of the game not being cool. You may say its worth it to play just to engage the wild-life but even they feel soul-less and void of life. I don't know how you make a game so devoid of soul really. I've met mannequins with more personality than anything I met in Fallout 76. \n\nThe world isn't interesting, it's a barren void forestry area. Sometimes you get a tiny bit of quest, however aside from this game being a complete and utter lore-destroyer for those interested, what it does leave is not good enough to compensate for all of the cons. Honestly, if this was a mod for 4, I'd feel better. But even when getting this for free, I feel scammed.\n\n[b] I'll end this by repeating my hours. 4. At no point was I excited. Enthralled. Interested. I sat for 4 hours, wanting to tear my hair out and scream, because I was so bored. I had tests in school, more interesting than this. The entire 4 hours I spent playing, I wish I had played anything else, & I got this for free! I genuinely wish you the best of help if you end up buying this game. It's horrific. [/b]\n- \"it's a puzzle game dressed up as a wargame\"\n\n1. puzzle games don't have this much randomness\n\n2. it uses authentic hex wargame conventions/mechanics so it's more of a puzzle game built out of a wargame\n\n3. you can take the puzzle element out of it by customizing your game.yml file to allow +5 turns, then play each scenario slow\n- Don't play this game. \n\nWhen you realise you almost completed it and the 112% is approaching, you start to think \"What the fuck am I going to play after this?\".\n\nThe lore is incredible.\nThe gameplay is so hard sometimes, but extremely satisfying. \nThe bosses are super hard, yet super fun.\nThe OST is insane.\n\nIf you never played Hollow Knight and you are about to begin your journey in Hallownest, bapanada to you.\nYou're very lucky and I am very jealous.\n- Do you have friends? Do you want to play games with your friends?\nBuy this game!\nDo you not have friends? Are you in need of consolation due to the endless lonely Friday nights spent playing Solitaire? \nConsider playing Dwarf Fortress.\n- As a fan of Mimimi's Stealth Strategy Game,\nI love it so much, the operation system is getting smoother and more user-friendly comparing to Desperados III & Shadow Tactics.\nAlso I like how they added new elements to the game to make it more playable (E.g. Flexible team choice, character stories)\n\nThe only thing I don't like is the art.\nGame design is good but it'd be great if there's good looking characters...\n- The game died because the company could not support server costs and its a damn shame because it was a fucking blast.  Why this game died and Dungeon Defenders II lives is a mystery to me.  Please re-release the game with Peer to Peer networking and I will pay $$\n- I listened to the reviews, and went into this game 'blind', careful not to watch or read anything before purchasing, in order to get the full 'experience'.\n\nAfter 8 hours, I'm left feeling that this game is like one of those 'critically acclaimed' movies that wins every award going. Then you go see it, and leave the cinema  wondering what all the hype was about. I know I'm in the minority, but I guess I must like my games to be a lot easier, or less punishing than most people.\n\n\n** Minor non-story spoilers ahead **\n\n\n\n\nThe game employs a 'groundhog day' mechanic, that basically means you can only experience the game in 22 minute chunks, then you're thrown back to the starting location for another 'loop'. There's no manual save because the game saves automatically every loop. So, you might be nearing the end of exploring a cave system, with just one more objective to scout, and... whoosh... back to the start.  This forces you to retrace your steps and cover old ground again and again and again because you won't be fully exploring anywhere in 22 mins.\n\nThe controls (Keyboard/Mouse) are awful. You can't use the mouse to point and click UI elements, or the mouse wheel to zoom and/or navigate menus. You can only use the mouse for looking around, and everything else is done using an unintuitive bunch of keys that an ambidextrous octopus would struggle with. Guess I should have listened when the game warned me that it's better to use a controller! The game was clearly made for console, and doesn't translate well to PC.\n\nWhen you do get your head around the clunky controls, the 'realistic' physics adds nothing to the game except to create a keyboard-smashing level of frustration. Navigating space and/or the landscapes in this game is a mix of falling, crashing, ricocheting, overshooting, and generally wasting time to get where you want to go.\n\nIronically, despite promising to be a space exploration game, the navigation difficulty, the constant race against the loop reset, and race against other timed game elements, actually discourages exploration, and often punishes you for doing so.\n\nI thought I was buying a relaxing, cerebral story-driven journey with puzzles to solve. Instead I got a spelunking jumping, crashing simulator, the point of which seems to be gathering a jumble of fragmented story elements, jigsaw fashion, discovering a little bit more each loop. The 'puzzles' are all about navigating the locations, often time-dependant, to unlock more story elements.\n\n\nPerhaps there is a wonderful endgame that I will never get to experience... but I can't force myself through any more tedious, frustrating loops to get there.\n- Heard joke once: Man goes to doctor. Says he's depressed. Says life seems harsh and cruel. Says he feels all alone in a threatening world where what lies ahead is vague and uncertain. Doctor says, \"Treatment is simple. Steam is having a sale tonight. Go buy a game. That should pick you up.\" Man siles. Says to Doctor, \"good idea, Doc! A nice relaxing distraction!\" Man goes home. Man buys DF.\n\nGood joke. Everybody laugh.\n\n\n\nBut seriously, I built a working moat with a remote drainage system control tower and a 4 storey above ground fort, becoming a thriving 200-strong hold of what was once a moribund empire of less than 10 dwarves. 100/10 game that is definitely worth the learning curve.\n- Great Remaster, the same for Red alert 2 and Tiberium Sun next please!\n- Took me a while to play this because there were some critical bugs during release day, but the devs worked hard to fix everything up.\n\nNow, this is the premium version of Mad Father which is not just a straight re-release of the free version, but an upgraded one (in many ways, I'm told). Better graphics, better level design, better everything. It's a really tight experience without any filler and with an interesting story, so any fans of RPGMaker-type horror games will find this a highly enjoyable experience.\n\nYou can also increase the game's window size, so don't worry if you're running a high-resolution display. This is a feature that is not exactly common for these types of games, but this game has got you covered.\n\nI'm looking forward to future games from the dev!\n- [b][i]Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout[/i][/b] is a 60 Player Battle Royal game of minigames to triumph over everybody for the sweet, GOLDEN CROWN\n[list]\n[*] Put in about 40 hours in combination on Beta 1 & 2\n[*] Won a ton and lost a ton\n[*] Enjoyed EVERY SECOND \n[/list]\n[b][u]PROS[/u][/b]\n[list]\n[*] Decent amount of minigames for launch, and even when you play the same ones they feel fun when different things happen\n[*] Games go fast if you're winning OR losing, you're able to play a lot and experience the game faster to get better\n[*] The BIG majority of the cosmetics in the game are NOT locked behind a paywall. Release has one $5 DLC for a hamburger, slurpee, and frie cosmetic but there are a TON of cosmetics to earn through the free battle pass they give you + the daily shop where you can buy cosmetics with earned in game currency\n[*] Customization for your character is extremely extensive and allows a lot of different combos\n[*] The game is literally just FUN, like play for hours with friends fun. There is NO stress\n[/list]\n[b][u]CONS[/u][/b]\n[list]\n[*] See-saw minigame is very advantaged to the players in the front due to how messed up the see saws behind you get clogged with players and being on sides for WAY too long\n[*] Grabbing is a bit weird and janky, sometimes its useful and sometimes it actually screws you over\n[*] Ragdoll physics sometimes cause you to roll a ton after falling (I like this feature a ton but others don't)\n[/list]\n\n[b] I definitely reccommend picking this game up. The Devs put a lot of time and effort into a game and for $20 it is actually steal. This game will provide hours of content, especially with them already announcing they will update with new cosmetics and mini-games as ready. Please give this game a shot :)\n- Can we please get an online co-op? My s/o and I both have the game and remote play doesn't work cuz internet connection is too slow. So we can't even play this game that we were super excited to play together. Please update for an online co-op!\n- this game is something i have literally always wanted but never thought would exist. a historical fiction narrative that isn't about war or combat but rather something as mundane as being a maid... AND they let you actually clean the rooms. i have been asking for this for years and years and then these psychopaths go and actually make it?? unfathomable. love it. my only critique is that I can't high five Eugene or take Wendy to the malt shop to help her feel better\n\nin seriousness it's not the most wildly divergent choice-based narrative of all time (there are small choices throughout that have an impact, but most of the consequence is delayed so it doesn't FEEL as impactful in the moment), which might put off some people who want a more sandbox feeling. consider it more of a detective game than an RPG. worth experiencing even if you don't have my particular brand of mental illness tho, 100%, especially if you like these kinds of games in general.\n- Don't buy this game if you are planning a full co-op playthrough with a friend.\n\nAt first we thought only story progress wasn't shared which was fine as we'd both get to experience the missions regardless. However it turns out that all unlocks tied to completing each area such as new guns, cars and basically all the things you'd want to progress in are locked for the person who isn't hosting. This means your partner is stuck with the level 1 unlocks from start to finish unless they go back and do everything in their game as well.\n\nCompletely pointless and took us until clearing one of the lieutenants for us to realise this, bought this a while back too so not gonna be able to get a refund. Worst implemented co-op I have seen in a long time.\n- Note this is not \"Steampunk Civ\" so don't think of it that way. Its effectively a story/scenario driven city builder. The game looks beautiful and works well with the world building that goes on with the game. \n\nYour games will be short but its still fairly challenging depending on the scenario you choose\n\nDefinitely recommended\n- [i]While the artwork and combat remain enjoyable, the story, writing, and pacing were a major letdown.[/i]  \n\n***\nMINOR SPOILERS BELOW. If you're going to play the game, play before reading.\n***\n\n[b]The mature storylines, hard-hitting decisions, beautiful worldbuilding, and tight writing that made the first two so immersive is not present in this game.[/b] (You'll notice immediately that the writing for the caravan in the capital is [i]particular[/i] trite, awkward to read, and uninteresting.)\n\nUnfortunately, it's not just the writing that's weak. [i]The pacing is off.[/i] Antecedents are confusing, characters you'd expect to speak don't, events that should have been foreshadowed come out of nowhere. More frustrating are the serious character continuity \"errors,\" and arcs that disappear, change, or go nowhere. [i]In short, the events, decisions, and conflict from the previous games do not appear or resolve in a way that was suggested by the previous two[/i].\n\n\nHere's one example. In Banner Saga 2, Fosolt is unexpectedly rescued by Bolverk. [i]\"I have a message for Alette from the dead varl king,\" [/i]he said. That's pretty intriuging! Maybe there's a mystery, an oracle, an item, or just cool information about the Varl and their strange king? Maybe there'll finally be context about the bridge decision!\n\n[i]No! He has nothing interesting to say or add, and then his storyline just gets dropped and forgotten.[/i]\n\nWell, Bolverk's been possessed by Bellower! Gosh, who knows what Bellower will say? In fact, I can't wait to find out what happens to Bellower's body! \n\nWell, actually, Bolver's [i]not[/i] possessed, not really, certainly not like it was implied last game, and Bellower's body -- [i]a primary focus of the first two games[/i] -- isn't mentioned [i]once[/i]\n\nOr how about how they casually mention that Eyvyn is not only the [i]head[/i] of the Valka order, but also that he's had periodic bursts of hereditary madness all along? That's... odd. And it's not presented as an well-thought out [i]reveal[/i] or anything. It's presented matter-of-factly, like they were trying to ret-con in a less interesting story, or were tone deaf.\n\nYou'll notice that all the characters are underutilized and have unfulfilled storylines/tensions. Hakon has hard choices to make; Canary's a little crazy; Yrsa is mysterious; Gil's in love with Alette, etc. Will these build into choices? Reveals? Dependent endings based on choices? Will there be discussions referencing the past? Reflections on travels? Hints of despair?\n\nNo. In mine, Gil was [i]murdered[/i] and no one even bothered to reference it. Canary's situation never comes to a head. You never have to choose between Varls and Humans. Murdering people doesn't make people threaten to leave. Ubin returns randomly as an uber Varl and he's... learned the horseborne's language? Travelled the southlands? In like, a month? In a way that doesn't advance the plot? It's just... weakly done.\n\n\nThere are [i]so many[/i] examples like this, where the stories don't quite fit correctly, where what you picked up on in the early games about the [i]mysteries[/i] and the [i]world[/i] and what made it a [i]vibrant[/i] place were forgotten about by the writers. [b]The result is that it the game plays out in unsatisfying ways, in tenseless scenarios made vapid by watered-down morality, an inability to leverage the situation in fun ways, and low-quality writing, paucity of choice-making, a lack of exploration, lack of plot twists, simplified overworld mechanics -- all culminating in an almost staggeringly one-dimensional and shallow ending.[/b]\n\nThe Banner Saga series was always an experience that was greater than the sum of its part. An [i]experience[/i]. Of being [i]riveted[/i] to the computer, checking the map, worrying over supplies, guessing at mysteries, having my breath taken away at each hill. Unfortunately, that's not the case in this game. \n\n\nGameplay-wise, it's also a bit of a letdown. Combat is fun-ish, but you can make invincible character combinations and the mechanics don't even try to deal with this. There's an interesting new reinforcement mechanic that's not used heavily, and never pushes you like you think the end of the world would. You never really have to split up your forces. There's no novelty. Like maybe using a hero in a battle makes them fatigued, so you have to switch them up? Maybe you can station them different places, making them unusable for combat? Maybe you need to choose eight for a secret mission caravan? Maybe dream sequences? No, nothing like that. \n\nThe overworld gameplay had some changes that never really felt significant. Moreover, quite a bit felt taken away. You can't rest, do training missions, no longer weigh food vs upgrades. One example of all thise tone deafness was Iver's march through the destroyed world was consistently at \"Great Morale!\"\n\nThere didn't seem to be many flavor choices (\"Do we hang the criminals or let them join us?\"), including much less on social themes (\"Should women fight, if it disturbs the traditionally-minded men?\" \"One clan's rowdy, what do we do?\" \"They threaten to leave if so and so isn't banished\"), and less delayed results and fewer significant decisions, including among the game's built-up tensions among the factions. \n\n\nThere's also some cases of development [i]feeling[/i] cheap. Remember opening Banner Saga 2, and feeling that it was [i]fresh[/i], and [i]upgraded[/i]? There's little to make you feel that way here. The artwork is okay, but the environments feel more generic, with less variety, and the surreal landscapes in the darkness aren't especially interesting to look at for long periods of time. Iver is voiced by Bolverk's voice actor, and they sound exactly the same. The new title system is a fun idea, but is visually integrated into the game's menu system with the finesse of a cheap mod. \n\nThere's a moment in the game where the screen goes black for scrolling text and voiceover narration explaining the upcoming mechanic. Um, a character can't explain that? It was similar how the many two second animations are used, not to supplement the story, but to [i]replace[/i] written portions, making you feel unsure about what's going on. And finally, the game's pretty short, without fun combat challenges or interesting newgame+ challenges. \n\n\nWhat's [i]particularly[/i] frustrating is that the game's release date was moved forward four months. I don't know the story why, but I do know that a few more months of polish and story embellishment might have delivered the beautiful, grippingly interactive story we were hoping for. Because this is a watered down version of the previous two in just about every way.\n\nThis negative review is for whatever processes lead to this mediocre finale.\n\n---\n\n[i]Here's a plot that would have made more sense. Zephyr arrives and speaks to you secretly. There's a god that's still alive! Neat, now we'll finally get more story on that. Yay, fun caravan mode, now we need to take longships somewhere interesting!\n\nBut uh-oh! There's a Sundr villain going there as well, with an army of dredge! But at least now we'll finally get more story about the Sundr! \n\nThe god reveals something interesting, talks about Juno, the sun, gives a means to protect the city and help Iver. But when you return to the city, now the king and rugga and the factions have devolved into fighting based on your choices. How are you going to handle this? Which of many possibilities will ascend to the throne? How will you defend the city? And what mystery lies beneath the mountain of the city...\n\nFor Iver's caravan, there should be pockets of dredge villages kept alive by Spellsingers. Now you need to decide to plunder them or not! More stuff to do! Maybe go to the remains of the Varl capital first? Fight warped Valka? Realize deceptions, machinations, corruption, hear stories? Find new characters, have old ones die?\n\nInstead there... wasn't a plot?[/i]\n- Getting 100% was... very fun in this cute metroid-vania where you basically act as your own level designer.\n\napproximate amount of time to 100%: 20-30 Hours\nEstimated achievement difficulty: 5/10\nMinimum number of playthroughs needed: One (Most likely 2 if you go in blind)\nMultiplayer achievements: No.\nMissable achievements: Yes. Sequence Break, \nPoint of no return: No. After the game's ending you can return and explore.\nGrinding Achievements:  No.\nDLC-Only achievements: No.\nTime-gated achievements: No.\nSpeed-run achievements: Yes. 4 hour Speed run (and another 4 hour Speedrun but with 100% Secrets/gold etc...)\nRNG-achievements: No.\nIs there a good guide available: I recommend Demajen's Guide on steam with the super usefull map.\nDoes difficulty affect achievements: Yes, Medium recommended. (There's also a 0 death achievement)\nFirst achievement unlock: Defeat the first boss in the tutorial temple.\n\n* I can't remember how this game ended up in my account (might have been some promotional giveaway...) but I'm so glad it did.\n\nThis game has some of the best Quality of life I've seen. It's extremely enjoyable and the 100% journey is challenging but not too problematic. Wholeheartedly recommend this one.\n- it's a shame but i honestly cannot recommend this game if you are a disabled person, i wasn't that far into the game when my character started panicking apon seeing a disabled person [person with leg braces] and then gets a \"no good answer\" bit of dialog and all the options are saying something wrong or saying nothing, trying to go with the least bad option aside from saying nothing since i know as a disabled person myself [i'm a wheelchair user] it can be pretty upsetting getting people just randomly stare at me and at least when they say something slightly wrong they are engaging with me as a person, my character then proceeds to talk abt what an \"inspiration\" it is 2 c a disabled person living their life,,, not exaggerating when i say i let my head hit the desk, closed the game and uninstalled, i understand that this is probably put in the game to be a teachable moment for the able bodied audience but ironically in trying to educate about us disabled people they then made the assumption that no disabled people would be playing their game as there is no option to make your character disabled or even to make them remotely aware of disability and ended up just making the experience awful for the disabled gamers they seem to be trying to help\n- ✔ Procedurally generated levels (some are not)\n✔ Neat graphics and animations\n✔ Good sound design\n✔ Solid and gratifying game mechanics \n✔ Well-balanced difficulty curve\n✔ Linux support!\n\n✘ No DRM-free build (yet?)\n✘ No user-generated content (no level editor)\n\nRuns surprisingly well on very low-end specs computer (under Linux too!).\nAn excellent turned-based action strategy game. Very polished and entertaining!\nYet one more proof that Swedish developers are among the best on this planet.\n- Developers should be proud of themselves for this awful game.\nAfter a 3 hour session with a friend, my legs are stiff, my heart is confused with constant beating and my brain is extremely satisfied and wants more.\n\nIf you like being scared and the horror genre, just find a like-minded friend and play it. Even when you are simply running in and out, it's going be a lot of fun. I have no idea how one would play a medium map but maybe with 4 people one might have the courage to walk inside that cursed high school more than we did - which was 2 meters into the entrance. We didn't have the heart for more.\n\nOn a serious note: It is worth the price, hands down.\n\nPS: Devs, I hate you for how good this game is.\n\nEdit: I'm back after about two weeks and 50~ more hours. I've played at least a couple of rounds every single day and I still love the game.\n\nMy suggestion is to find a friend who'd enjoy this, get the game both and play. DON'T READ ABOUT IT! Just play for a while, enjoy screwing up, getting spooked, killed, whatever happens! The more you learn about the mechanics, the more you lose the fear, so don't read about it!\nI mean I'm still a coward at level 60 something but that's me. Of course if you are like me, then why are you reading this and not buying the game?\n\nFinal word: Check their discord to find like-minded people in the LFG! You won't be alone, I promise!\n- Full disclosure: I'm not a racing guy. I'm not a car guy, even. My extent of car knowledge begins and ends at \"vroom-vroom go that way.\"\n\nBut that's all you need to know for this game. I can tune the holy bejeezus out of a million sliders that mean absolutely nothing to me, or I can just equip a premade setting by someone who does and suddenly the vroom-vrooms are *better*. Not sure when to brake or start a turn? Easy, there's a friendly line. Follow the line, make less vroom-vrooms when it's red, everything's gravy. Don't have the reaction time to follow the line? You can slow the game down until it's at a pace where you can. Incredible.\n\nYou can be as serious as you want with it. Me, I'm taking my van that's dolled up to look like the Mystery Machine and ramping it off a volcano.\n- Everything apart from the matches is superb, best FM ever. \n\nThe match engine is fundamentally broken - too easy to split a defence open with a long ball resulting in a one-on-one, so SI nerfed the conversion rates of one-on-one chances to keep scorelines acceptable. The result however, is that your world class  striker misses 2-5 easy chances every game. \n\nWingers do not square the ball for strikers, instead preferring to shoot from obscenely acute angles rather than play the ball across the box. \n\nHalf the crowd is a repeated man in an orange jumper. This may sound minor but it's really immersion breaking once you notice it. You can be a team that plays in blue, and yet over 50% of the crowd are dressed in orange. It diminishes the match experience and detracts from the game as a whole.\n\nIt's crap like this, broken for 2 months now, I've bought every game in this series since the year 2000, I pre-order every year (literally the only game I will do so with) and said I'll continue to do so until I get burned. Well, SI Games, you've broken me at last. The 'Bugs' section of your forum is littered with these issues that are \"under review\", well you can consider my purchase of FM 2021 in the same category.\n\nEdit: I played a bunch more because apparently I'm a masochist. The match engine is total cack and has regressed massively since FM 2017. Don't waste your money - take up a more enjoyable pastime such as jamming needles in your eyes, you'll thank me for it.\n- A Short Hike is a relaxing, casual game about exploring an expansive, mountainous island park and eventually making your way to its summit so you can get cell phone reception.\n\nYou play as Claire, a bird who can climb, glide, and flap to great heights using a stamina system based upon how many golden and silver feathers you’ve collected. Along the path to the mountaintop you’ll encounter Animal Crossing-style characters who are friendly, punny, and usually have some minor task for you to solve, ranging from finding lost items to making deliveries.\n\nHelping residents of the island is completely optional, as is just about every activity in the game other than locating a few feathers and reaching the summit; as a result, length can range from an hour if you don’t stop to smell the roses to a few hours if you decide to make friends with everyone and see all the park has to offer.\n\nActivities include filling out a fishing journal by trading in your catches, digging in suspicious spots, solving treasure map clues, parkour racing, and opening up shortcuts by breaking blocked entrances and watering bouncy flowers. \n\nA Short Hike has a charming aesthetic and a lovely, peaceful soundtrack. I felt driven to see everything the game had to offer despite not being forced into any of it and never lost interest until I did so. It’s a beautiful little world that will make fans of Animal Crossing feel right at home.\n- Mixed review, so I will list the good and bad:\n\nGood:\n-Fun to play with friends\n-You have stuff to do for 20+ hours\n-Exploring and survival is done well\n-In creative you can build a pirate ship\n\nBad:\n-Sometimes lag\n-Sometimes trouble locating islands\n-Alone this is boring (sorry shark, you are not enough company)\n-My alpaca named Marcel keeps dying because he refused to eat (fixed now but rip 4 Marcels)\n\nEdit:\n+New engine and rudder added much control\n+New islands are easily explored by one person\n+Lore added\n+Finally you can charge your empty batteries\n+Finally you can too farm honey on your raft\n+Character models to find\n-Biofuel consumption and making is a meh for me\n-If you add saltwater too fast to the filter you lose the empty bottle or cup\n- I have it on the Epic store but the amount of stuttering it has made it unplayable so I gave up. I got the Humble choice for $6 to get a steam key and try it on here because I have a few games on steam that run well but run poorly on other platforms like the awful Windows store or the below average Epic launcher, but it's unfortunately the same deal on here for this game. It has done it on two entirely different computer setups for me so that tells me that they didn't bother to spend enough time testing enough different pc setup combinations when it was in development, and my pc setup isn't rare by any means. The look and functioning of the UI and menu's shows that it is a obvious direct console port which would explain their lack of attention to the pc version.\n\nEven giving it a fair shot based on content, it's pretty much just a modified version of Borderlands 2. The amount of dialogue is unbearable. No one in the game EVER shuts up, and every single last word they say is cringe. It's like a kid in fifth grade who laughs at fart jokes wrote the entire script. In addition to everyone never shutting up, the main boss randomly has page-long speeches over the radio just to make sure you get the message that they want you to feel entirely uncomfortable at this game's bottomless amount of cringe.\n\nThe gameplay is identical to BL2, with the only real new noticeable features being that some guns have two functions that you can toggle on and off with the C key and of course the new playable characters. However even without the stuttering ruining the game for me, it's my opinion that BL3's negatives, mainly the insane amount of neverending dialogue and how unbelievably cringe it is, overshadow its positives.\n- its a very stressful game and rly hard but the fact that u can lose all ur progress because of a mistake is on another level of insane but in the end if u r determined u will finish it and the feeling when u finish it after all the time is very good i never felt this good in my life about finishing a game or a puzzle its a rly good game i recommend\n- RPGMaker games are renowned for their hit-or-miss quality, with misses far outweighing the hits, at least in the Steam community. That risk said, I love going through the RPGMaker tags and picking out hidden gems. Do I miss a lot and get duds? Sure. But then I find a game like Ara Fell and realize why I enjoy taking my chances. \n\nNow to be fair, most people are playing the Unity version of this game now rather than the original RPGMaker version. While the Unity version is definitely the definitive and better version - I have played both - and it's original RPGMaker version was a very fun experience, too. \n\nThe presentation of this game is top notch. Never before  have a I seen an RPGMaker title that used many of the default assets, and yet made the design of the game their own to the point I had to remind myself of that fact. A lot of these Indie developed RPGMaker games use default assets, and that's fine - it's all about using them in unique and interesting ways, which is where a great many games fail, but not Ara Fell. \n\nSo the game manages to be a visual treat despite itself, but what about the music? Also top notch. Rarely do you play a game of this style and immediately get treated to unique and pleasant music right out of the gate, and it never ceases to be an auditory treat. Usually there is always those one or two tracks that you just don't care for, and it causes you to either mute the sound or to try to get through a section as quickly as possible, but not so in Ara Fell. \n\nGame play is probably the most unique asset this game has to offer. The battles are much more tactical than your traditional turn-based affair because MP is not a finite source - it regens over time. You are encouraged to not simply \"Mash A\" your way to victory. You need to use your skills to the fullest in battle. No really, you have to or this game will beat you to a pulp. While certainly not the most difficult game in the world, and can be cheesed with knowledge, it's no cakewalk either. You have to be smart and a bit strategic to get far in this game.\n\nAnyway, I could gush and gush about this game forever and not get bored. The point is, Ara Fell is an amazing RPGMaker (more so inspired now that it runs on Unity) title that is certainly a diamond among the pile of dirt and rocks. I would go as far to say it is my favorite game of it's caliber, and I have played a great many RPGMaker titles, some also very good. I can think of no higher praise to give this game.\n- Micromanage your 90%+ minority space colony simulator 2017\n\nSeriously, when choosing my starting colonists I had to reroll 15-20 times per colonist to get a white male colonist. It's almost like this game was made for Swedens' liberal party or something\n\n0/10 for feminista multi-kulti propaganda\n- oh good god how do i remove things from my library\n- With almost 300 hours of Destiny 2 (D2) back on Battle.net (the Blizzard launcher), let me give this perspective/advice for new players, specifically with regards for the F2P offering that is Destiny 2: New Light, with a few more holistic thoughts sprinkled throughout:\n\nThis overall game is very good. It doesn't always live up to its promise (the first mission of every campaign is always the most polished thing aside from the raids/dungeons), but when it does, it [b]really[/b] shines.\n\nThe gunplay is unrivaled. The visual/audio feedback is great, the handling feels really good, and enemies really pop when you take them out. Expect nothing less from the studio that brought us grunt birthday parties.\n\nThe game is better in a fireteam. Now that the base game is F2P [though with considerably less content than it used to be/I would like], this should be easier than ever for most activities. That said, a huge majority of my playtime was done solo. It can get tricky at times (\"Darkness Zones\" in certain missions prevent respawning but allow for revives, so solo players have a distinct disadvantage there). \n\nWith that said, dungeons (currently 'The Shattered Throne', 'Pit of Heresy', 'Prophecy' which is free to all players, 'Grasp of Avarice', 'Duality', and 'Spire of the Watcher') and raids (\"Last Wish\" from Forsaken, \"Garden of Salvation\" from Shadowkeep, \"The Deep Stone Crypt\" from Beyond Light, 'Vow of the Disciple' from Witch Queen, as well as 'Vault of Glass' and 'King's Fall' from D1 - both of which are both free to all players) are best experienced with a team, so don't shy away from LFG group-finder options like the Discord, official app, or any number of other sites (just make sure to accurately describe your experience, level, and gear. 'Tis only polite). \n\nOf the matchmade multiplayer offerings, I enjoy Gambit (PvPvE, reminds me of the Black Ops Zombies 4z4 mode done right), jump into the occasional Strike (PvE, matchmade fireteams running campaign-like missions), and have no interest in Crucible (PvP, it's fine I guess, but I've never liked PvP that's dependent in large part on personal progression - especially in the competitive modes like Trials of Osiris and Iron Banner)\n\nDon't be afraid to ignore content - this is absolutely the kind of game where you can set your own goals. Want a specific exotic gun? Look up where it drops and focus on grinding that content. Want a specific roll on a random roll gun? Find the best possible farming (or crafting) method and go to town. Chase down some of the exotic questions that the game clutters up your quest page with, or just goof around doing things that you find fun while absolutely ignoring all signposts.\n\nSome stuff just won't be explained in game. It's not as bad as Warframe (much less need for a wiki) but some things are still obscured. Feel free to look up Xur (exotic weapon vendor who visits on weekends) and other hidden exotics tied to specific activities, lost sectors, patrol locations, or quest chains.\n\nFor anything that you can't easily find online - reach out and find a sherpa. The community for this game tends to be pretty great, and enough of us have spent enough time leaning specific parts of it (e.g. raids) or just mechanics in general (\"What are random rolls? Which do I keep?\") that we'd be happy to jump onto discord (there are a bunch for PC, just check out the subreddit sidebar linked below) and answer any and all questions you may have. \n\nThe fact that a representative chunk of this game is free makes this the perfect time to dip your toes in without emptying out your wallet. Any other questions about this game as a product (\"Should I pay for DLC? Is Eververse worth it?\") should absolutely be researched elsewhere.\n\nIf you're looking for a place to start with the F2P content, finish the intro missions in the Cosmodrome. New and returning players are semi-regularly upgraded to a new light level floor, but means that you can miss out on the \"learning the ropes\" parts of the game that come with working your way through the New Light quest chain or unlocking different subclasses. [As of Beyond Light, all of the campaign content through Forsaken are not currently accessible. Release order was Red War (launch campaign) > Forsaken > Shadowkeep > Beyond Light > Witch Queen, followed by the upcoming expansions Lightfall > Final Shape.]\n\nEyes up, guardian.\n\nFootnotes for people yelling at me in the comments:\n-All of this is my opinion. Feel free to hold your own and disagree with mine.\n-I generally enjoy grinding, looter shooters, FPS's, and weird sci-fi space magic. Halo, Borderlands, Warframe, and CoD Zombies are some of my most-played and favorite games.\n-As far as I can tell, anything that is not strictly subjective in the above is factually correct [as of Season of Plunder, with updates noted throughout. This game changes quite a bit over time, so make sure to do your own research before spending money on it]. If I've missed something, feel free to point it out in the comments and I'll do my best to update this periodically. \n-This review previously made mention of both content vaulting and weapon sunsetting. These practices have both been discontinued as of Season of Plunder. However, it is not clear at this if or when power capped or vaulted may return/be uncapped, if ever.\n\n-----------------\nTL:DR: It's good. Not perfect, but really good. And since it's free, you can get a really good sense of if this game is for you without paying for any of it. You can play almost any activity solo pretty easily except for a handful of endgame activities. If you're overwhelmed at first, just play through the Cosmodrome missions while you get your feet under you, or ask a veteran player for help.\n-----------------\n\nSites to use (List was compiled at Shadowkeep launch, but most of it should still be relevant/useful)\n\n    \nBeginner's Guide (Current as of Beyond Light) - https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/49007\n\nThe DTG Subreddit - /r/DestinyTheGame on Reddit - https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/\n\nDestiny Item Manager (mange your inventory from your browser even while in-game, essential to avoid unneeded trips back to the tower) - app.destinyitemmanager.com\n\nDestiny 2 Checklist (Lists out everything to do as well as when it resets in-game) - www.d2checklist.com/\n\nLight gg (Database of in-game items, useful for looking up random rolls) - https://www.light.gg/\n\nBraytech org (Lots of overlapping features, but I really like their maps) - braytech.org/\n\nDatto (Destiny Youtuber / 24:02 Raider who posts lots of useful/educational content, including exotic guides) - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkmAjbIecTIjTQctolYeuDw\n\nIf you've played D2 on another system, check out the CrossSave page (https://www.bungie.net/7/en/crosssave) on the Bungie net official site respectively to get all of your content and progression moved over to Steam.\n\nStory Recap up through Shadowkeep (Spoilers Destiny 1 / D1, and D2, obviously) (My name is Byf on YouTube: The Complete Story of Destiny!

I never had a gaming experience quite like this one, and it really felt as if I had to deduce and think things through. It made me feel more like a detective than most point-and-click mystery adventures. And don't get me wrong, I wouldn't include this game in that category, which I love.\n\nThe plot was amazing, and it was full of clever bits. The game got challenging in a good way without going overboard, and I think the vast majority of deductions was fair, except perhaps one in case 9, which I doubt I would have ever gotten without an in-game hint. The end was a bit anticlimactic after such a build-up, but overall it was a very satisfying journey. I'd definitely be interested in other games using the same concept. If you're unsure, like I was, I suggest trying out the demo where you can play 4 out of the 12 cases.\n- I knew Journey is a great game,maybe one of the best video games in history,but...\n\nI didn't know why so many people moved by such a simple gameplay.\nI didn't know why people had a Journey-Fever,even players just bought PS3 only for this game.\nI didn't know how close a relationship could be in 100mins only.\nI didn't know how bad i wished to go back to the peak and stay with my friend i'll never meet again.\n\nNow I Know.\n\n“It is better to walk with a friend in the dark than alone in the light” – Helen Keller\n\nIt was an interesting experience for me, I had never played this game nor heard of it until recently. I went and looked at the store page, My Brother/Friend Ethan-Winters Just Told Me this game in the steam store now, so went ahead and bought it. After buying it, went and started up the game some day later. Went into the game, saw another model character that looks like mine, I thought it was an AI because I had thought it was a single player game. So I decided to play along with it, we went through the story, it progressed quite fast, mainly because we both did not really bother to check out other things. The more I played, the more I realized that the guy I was playing with was most definitely not an AI, it was a genuine player. As we went through the story, our cooperation got smoother, we no longer have a solo player attitude, we would signal to each other, wait for each other and walked, fly with each other. It was smoothing, relaxing, a truly unique experience. Even with the setbacks we had throughout our progression, we never gave up, we stuck together from the desert till the end, when one of us screwed up, we patiently waited for the other, chiming to the person where we are. I remember at the end, when i screwed up a jump and did not see the other player, I was genuinely scared, sad, I frantically searched for the person but to no avail. I was distraught, sad and disappointed but I continued onward. When I went up, there he was, chiming for me, assuring me that he had not left yet. I felt happy, comforted when I saw the person waiting for me and together we finished the story. I am not one to do reviews, but it was such a unique experience among my years of gaming that I had to share it. Thank you, punks for the experience, truly thank you. And thank you, for bothering to read my review.\n\ni'll never forget our journey kind stranger.\n\nThis wasn't a game, it was an experience. I highly recommend you do this.\n- ULTRAKILL is a fine game with cool movement mechanics. However most of the guns don't feel beefy at all and, really, there's not much content to be had. Wait for ACT 3 before forking out $20 for this.\n\nedit: after getting every p rank, gaming\n- This game is set to release in early October, but I definitely wouldn't buy it anytime soon. It's not ready. It's full of weird little errors, the mechanics and UI are clunky as hell, there's a lot of information you really need but don't get, the \"events\" are incredibly repetitive, half the time the wording is so bad you're left confused what's actually happening, even the basics aren't there- random capitalization, no consistency from panel to panel or objective to objective... This game needs another 6 months in EA.\n- They need to add more weapons like a galil or m249 or something and maybe more vehicles and playmodes.But overall so many possibilities\n- This game is set to release in early October, but I definitely wouldn't buy it anytime soon. It's not ready. It's full of weird little errors, the mechanics and UI are clunky as hell, there's a lot of information you really need but don't get, the \"events\" are incredibly repetitive, half the time the wording is so bad you're left confused what's actually happening, even the basics aren't there- random capitalization, no consistency from panel to panel or objective to objective... This game needs another 6 months in EA.\n- Ok so... \n\nFar From Noise is a narrative game in which you play a woman stuck in its car, balancing on the edge of a cliff. \n\nIt's about life, death, nature, purpose, creativity, dreams, stars and badgers. \n\nThe thing about Far From Noise is that it'll ask you something very special, something that we all forget to do nowadays, something that I've forgotten. This game will ask you to take your time. Don't rush things. Sit down and relax as you'll be forced to follow the slow pace of the game, but you'll enjoy it, for sure.\n\nThis game is for you if you come home after a rough day at work. This game is for you if you're searching for a meaning, a purpose in your life. This game is for you if you just want to experiment something new.\n\nBecause Far From Noise is offering you something new. It gives a vibe that is between Firewatch and Life is Strange, but without all the forced action, stress, adrenaline those game wanted to give. Don't misunderstand me, I loved those 2 games, but Far From Noise chose a direction more... pure. It's just you and the nature that evolves around you.\n\nI've finished the game within 90 mins, but I heard they were several endings, so I might as well try to get some more (but the one I've got fully satisfied me, to be honest).\n\nBeing more pragmatic, the art and sound coincide perfectly. The visuals are gorgeous and the musics hit just right where it needs to. You'll be lifted by the compositions as you'll stare into the beautiful sunset, and the dark starry sky.\n\nYou may find it expensive, as the game costs 8$ for one hour and a half of experience, but hey, think about a cinema ticket. Far From Noise is cheaper and the experience you'll live in it is wayyyyy more unique than most of the movies you go see. \n\nI recommend it. Play it. It'll put your mind at ease.\n\n\n\nPS: the main character is one of the most well-written i've seen in video games.\n- I am a day one player who quit the game within a few days. After coming back after almost 2 years, I am shocked and surprised. The overall improvement is great, quests are not bothering you. Story and atmosphere is hooking you up and the overall experience is good. Leveling up is easy and also you are not struggling as in most MMOs.\n\nDespite the past of the game, I think it is worth trying.\n- Wanna spend 20% of the time scared, 60% of the time confused, 15% of the time infuriated, and 5% of the time laughing your ass off? THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU!\n\nFor the rest, save your money.\n\nIt's so buggy, dark, poorly optimized, and confusing; you'll spend more time pulling your hair out than the rare moments that it actually manages to pull off a jumpscare. Also, it is NOT procedurally generated at all. Watched a YouTuber play this game and got the exact same map and jumpscares... er... \"jumpscares\" as they did. Not worth $10. If they can fix the bugs and tweak a few things, though, it'd at least be worth 5.\n\n- This game is amazing! Truly the Dark Souls of little girl simulators.\n\nI’m glad that Dark Souls taught me how to dodge in literally every video game, it unknowingly prepared me for this. Ender Lilies is a Soulslike with JoJo Stand combat. That’s an instant win for me.\n\nThe world is depressing, suffocating and overwhelmingly beautiful. Each stories of the main spirits are well written and realistically human. The endings are top notch too.\n\nIf you’re even considering playing it… play it… I promise you won’t regret it. I was much more emotionally invested in this game than I was on Hollow Knight. Lilly is an amazing protagonist… and she never even utters a word. She doesn’t have to.\n\nIt's a beautiful game with fun combat, awesome art and amazing music. My only real complaint was a bit of exploration fatigue having to go around finding all the collectibles. \n\nI think the easiest way to sum up Ender Lilies is \"It's Momodora, but better.\" It has the same gameplay loop of \"slash slash roll behind the enemy slash slash repeat\" and fairly challenging bosses, in a much bigger and more non-linear world with nearly every single room having some sort of collectible. It's also aesthetically atmospheric and pleasing, and the soundtrack is great.\n\nI can safely say that this game is a creative masterpiece. And in the end… Like Lilly, don’t we all have a little girl inside of us, telling us to stop all this silliness and go back to being the proper good boys our Mother wanted us to be?\n\n10/10\n- As a historical novelist and former high school English teacher with over 700 books in my home devoted to ancient Greek literature, history and culture I had to try this game.\n\nI should mention that I am pushing 60 years old and although I like strategy games like Creative Assembly’s Rome II, I’m not a fan of ‘gopher’ games that make you run around collecting items, rescuing damsels in distress, delivering messages, and murdering politicians to level your character.  The whole premises seems rather tedious and unimaginative.  \n\nSo right from the start I expected to hate Assassin’s Creed Odyssey.  Combine that with the fact that I’d never played an Assassin’s Creed game before, and I am not the most nimble finger clicker, I was prepared to spend a good portion of my playing time getting my head lopped off.  \n\nNone of that happened.  Well, yeah, there is a pretty steep learning curve here.  I did spend a lot of my initial hours zigging when I should have been zagging, and with my opponent’s spear in my head, but I stuck with it and eventually even an old poop like me was able to figure out the mechanics.\n\nWhat kept me going was the sheer majesty of the game and the beauty of the surroundings.  \n\nI’ve been to Athens, Sparta, Argos, Mycenae, Delos, Aegina, Hydra, Crete, Melos (now Santorini), and dozens of other locales on the campaign map multiple times.  I’ve walked around the ruins at Delphi, strolled the docks of Piraeus and walked through valley of Laconia for research for my books.  I wanted to see these places at they might have looked 2,500 years ago and that for me is the true joy of Assassin’s Creed Odyssey.\n\nThe team at Ubisoft deserves a lot of credit.  They did their homework.  Sure, you’d expect to see historical figures like Pericles, Socrates, Alcibiades and Archidamas in a game about the Peloponnesian War.  But that anyone outside of academia even knows who Brasidas, Aspasia, Herodotus and Pausanias were, is impressive.  Kudos to you.\n\nI’m probably an oddball gamer because I was not motivated by stabbing people in the back to gain levels and steal loot.  The entire idea of stabbing people in the back goes against the grain of the Greek ethos of ‘kleos’ or honor.  What kept me going was the desire to see more of the world that Ubisoft created.  \n\nI wanted to visit the Athenian Acropolis and see the Propylaea, Erechtheion and Parthenon as they were shiny and new, instead of in piles of rubble.  I wanted to gaze up at Phidias' statue of Zeus in Olympus (one of the wonders of the ancient Greek world that no longer exists), speak to the Pythia at the temple of Delphi, and see the five villages of Sparta as they might have looked.  Getting to walk the streets of Athens, Argos and Elis was like taking a trip back in time.  Magical.\n\nOkay, the game isn’t perfect.  The pronunciation of common names like Pericles and Socrates and the character’s accents were maddening.  I can only guess that Ubisoft believes we’ve Americanized the real pronunciations, or at least I hope that’s what they were thinking.  Ultimately it’s a minor annoyance.\n\nThe hoplite battles were a major disappointment.  The Greeks fought in a phalanx formation.  Shoulder to shoulder.  Shield to shield.  The battles here are a 300 movie style free for all.  Oh well, guess you can’t have everything.  \n\nAlso I could not fathom how Alexios and Kassandra could be descended from Leonidas, but have no connection to the Agiad royal family.  By rights they should have been Pausanias’ cousins, but they’re not.  I don’t know who they are. The whole Pythagoras-is-my-father thing is rather bizarre and makes no sense at all.  \n\nI won’t go off the charts here listing the historical inaccuracies that drove me batsh!t crazy, as it serves no purpose.  Suffice it to say that I enjoyed the game.  \n\nIf you ever wanted to unravel the labyrinth of the minotaur beneath King Minos palace at Knossos, get drunk and sing songs with Socrates at an Athenian symposium, feel the Aegean Sea roll beneath your feet on the deck of a  trireme, or stare out in wonder at the lights twinkling over Attica at twilight, try this game.  You won’t be disappointed.\n- Incomphrehesible UI, sloppy controls.\n\n\nGranted I'm a day one player, but very steep learning curve. Couldn't figure out interstellar nav, for the life of me, and the touchy controls made the dogfighting a chore. Save your money. This isn't a jump in and play game.\n- It's DND but you're a schizo pizza guy and you have to rizz everyone up at the club\n\n8.5/10\n- Was a bit turn off when I saw it was a stationary shooter, but the game is so fun I look past that and even began to enjoy the room scaling dodging mechanics (game can make you work up a sweat!).\n\nA must for anyone looking for a more intense arcade shooting experience. I cannot overstate how fun it is to build your weapons in VR, the crafting system works flawlessly and seemely without the need of menus or UIs getting in the way, props for the devs for how well the game integrates with VR controls.\n\nWhat I liked:\n- Varied enemies\n - Great VR controls\n- Gun crafting is addicting and allows for a lot of experimentation\n- Great Bosses\n\nWhat I had trouble with:\n- Makes you wish you could run around the rooms like the original game!\n- The reduced FOV of most VR headsets makes it quite difficult to keep track of enemies that come from multiple directions. Some rooms require so much head movement that I tend to get sick.\n- When a room spawns with multiple shield pylons and a healer bot, it gets extremely frustrating if you have slow moving projectile weapons.\n\nWishes:\n- More gun parts! (Maybe future DLC?)\n- When I first played Battlefield 1 it literally sent me to the hospital, cause you’re supposed to seek immediate medical attention if your erection lasts longer than 4 hours.\n\nThis is easily one of the most badass games  in history. The music, the landscape, the gunplay, the hit register and the satisfying kill effect, EVERYTHING is just amazing. The last true Battlefield game. I enjoyed every second of this amazing game.  \n\nBF1 isn’t fully historically accurate but it is historically immersive. The war stories in this game genuinely made me emotional sometimes and I’m not ashamed to admit that. \n\nAs someone who is more on the “historical accuracy” side of games, I can say without a doubt that Battlefield 1 did an incredible job. Hell, they were even able to be diverse without pandering to anybody! The 1st Russian Women’s Battalion of Death, the Harlem Hellfighters, people from French-occupied northwestern Africa, the list goes on. What sets this game’s inclusivity of a variety of people and groups from other games is that it does so when it has a reason to and is still accurate to the time and setting. \n\nThat’s one of the main reasons why Battlefield 5 pissed me off so much. Instead of a British woman with a prosthetic arm wielding a cricket bat in WW2, why not include Lyudmila Pavlichenko, aka Lady Death, a female Russian sniper who had 309 confirmed kills? What about the French women who fought? They were in extremely small numbers, but they were a thing. Historically accurate inclusion is fucking awesome, and I love when games do it. But inclusivity for its own sake is terrible and it cheapens said character’s presence in the game’s setting. \n\nEven the DLC are fantastic. I remember how amazing I felt when the “for the Tsar” DLC came out and I first played it. I have never seen people fight so hard to the death in a video game without a whole lot of rage. It was amazing. I felt like I was part of the Russian revolution. Please do yourself a favor and buy this game.\n\n9/10\n\nOnly gave it a 9 ‘cause the 1 is already there…\n- I reviewed the original Mark of the Ninja more than 4 years ago. I liked its stealth-based gameplay approach and praised the learning curve experienced throughout the story. I bought the [i]Special Edition[/i] which practically meant an add-on with some more levels, a custom and the option to replay the entire game in commentary mode. \n\nYou know some games get re-released due to the availability of a new console generation. This [i]Remastered[/i] edition is what was made available for PS4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch users not long ago. We, PC gamers (who already own the original Mark of the Ninja), can get this version free-of-charge in our library.\n\nThere's not much to say, really. I do not have a 4K display so this higher resolution I cannot enjoy. Compressed in-game art or not the original already looked very good. But the creators confirmed this will give us an enhanced experience even under 1080p resolution. \n\nWell, I did complete the game once again as this is how much I love MoN. I recommend that you do the same.\n\nPS: It may be possible that you are required to have the special edition of the original version to get the remastered version.\n- Mori's 3-Part Review:\n1. Bare minimum information and recommendations to improve your playthrough\n2. Background information on me and my playthrough\n3. More extensive non-spoiler reactions\n \nPart 1: Recommendations for You\nIf you're like me and you try to get all the extra scene dialogue, then please, if you take nothing else from this, give yourself time to play this game yourself. There is actually so much content here, I really want you all to take your time to experience it as you go. The game is just too long to binge in a reasonably short amount of time, and if you do binge, you're going to lose a lot.\n \nMy recommendations:\n1. Give yourself time to play the game. Let it sink in, and take notes- it'll be rewarded. The game is literally too dense and too long to binge reasonably if you like 100%ing.\n \n2. Get invested in the characters and pay attention to them, not just the (admittedly stellar) mysteries.\n \n3. Explore the game, its mechanics, and its dialogue yourself. Don't be afraid to restart a Somnium several times; the more options you pick, the more meaningful information you get.\n \n4. If you're a puzzle lover then try to solve the game yourself. You're going to have a blast if you manage it, and the game has tons of built-in hint systems to make it even easier, fairer, and more fun.\n \n5. Try to go in knowing at little as you can. The marketing has already done a great job. Focus on finishing the game and bringing it all together.\n \n6. On PC, force anti-aliasing on using your graphics card to make the game prettier. Game ran and controlled smoothly with few bugs.\n \n7. You don't need AI1 to play AI2, but I think AI2 does spoil AI1, though you could still enjoy them in reverse order.\n \n7. If you're sensitive to horny then just read less background dialogue in Ryuki side. Gore is pretty toned down, and there isn't any single huge CW.\n \nYou can stop reading now if you don't want your playthrough tainted by my reactions/expectations effected.\n \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nPart 2: Who am I, and how do I play?\nI'm an Uchikoshi fanatic. I've played all his English-translated games, and visual novels are my favorite genre of game. I've played a lot of visuals novels, but Uchizawa's are my favorites. I usually try to 100% complete all the scenes and see all the bonus dialogue. I've also played a lot of other genres of game, and I do like fun gameplay, but the most important things to me tend to be:\n \nA. An interesting story is absolutely what gets me invested\nB. Bunches of novel ideas like unique plot points I haven't seen before, philosophical ideas, or puzzles\nC. Characters that I at least don't actively hate; I can like a game for the above two, but characters still matter\nD. Deep personal connection, usually formed by connections to real people or how a game shaped my life\n \nThose are the ways I rate my top games. For the last 8 years, my top 2 favorite games have been the same:\n \nMy top favorite game of all time is Remember11. I love the plot, the ideas, the twists, the characters, and it's what got me truly invested in Uchikoshi. It's very much a mystery game first with an unravelling mystery and themes I love to explore.\n \nMy second favorite game is Virtue's Last Reward. I love the interactive moral dilemmas. VLR's use of the Prisoner's Dilemma jumpstarted my interested in Philosophy which led me to major in Philosophy. I don't like the characters as much save for a few, but it's still very important to me.\n \nNow, let me tell you how I've played AINI: I've basically been playing non-stop since June 13th.\n \nTake this with a grain of salt because I've been documenting as I play (the average main story playtime seems to be 20-35 hours, with 100% likely taking 50+), but right now, I have 97 hours of playtime. I have not gotten all the dialogue, achievements, or fully explored the abundance of extra mechanics. Instead, I have a 616-page reaction document full of constant laughs, cries, screams, passing out, and most of all love.\n \nPart 3: My Review\nThe R11 #1 and VLR #2 holy duology held true for 8 years. Also, AI1 isn't one of my favorite standalone games; it has huge personal connection for me because of the community and the AI1 ARG, but it wasn't my favorite as a game.\n \nI gave all that background because I want you to take me seriously when I say this:\nAI2 is my new favorite game. The #1 spot has been Easily dethroned.\n \nThe themes, twists, characters, ideas, gameplay, visuals, voice acting, fair mystery, presentation, mechanics, and comedy all of it resonates together perfectly. I don't even tend to value gameplay or visuals, but at many times, this game is fun to play while looking genuinely beautiful and cinematic.\n \nThe story reads like a proper Uchikoshi + Nakazawa return to form. The mystery is fair, interesting, meaningful, and complex told satisfyingly. There are many deep ideas, concepts, and themes utilized in thought-provoking ways.\n \nGameplay-wise, there are tons of mechanics that are utilized to make each Somnium unique; they all feel designed by love, fair, and reflective of the character through gorgeous symbolism. They blow the first game completely out of the water. Each one is its own experience to explore and a visual delight. There are also tons of mechanics for you to discover that make AI2 a fun game to play.\n \nThe animations, voices, and directing are cinematic; this game is actually breathtaking a lot of the time. It's backed up by great and charming character writing- despite the fact Mizuki is my favorite AI1 character with 0 contest, I grew to like much of the AI2 cast the same amount.\n \nAI2 is a story about halves and splitting, but also love and coming together- please, see it through until it's whole. I hope and believe you will all fall in love with AI2 like me; AI2 is all I've ever wanted. AI2 is my dream game come true; it's a gorgeous love letter to all Uchikoshi fans who love Zero Escape's puzzles, Infinity's mysteries, and AI's characters and humor.\n- ✔ Procedurally generated levels (some are not)\n✔ Neat graphics and animations\n✔ Good sound design\n✔ Solid and gratifying game mechanics \n✔ Well-balanced difficulty curve\n✔ Linux support!\n\n✘ No DRM-free build (yet?)\n✘ No user-generated content (no level editor)\n\nRuns surprisingly well on very low-end specs computer (under Linux too!).\nAn excellent turned-based action strategy game. Very polished and entertaining!\nYet one more proof that Swedish developers are among the best on this planet.\n- Please, bare with me here...I NEVER write reviews for anything (this is probably the third review I have ever written), but I feel like I need to write this one for so many reasons!!!  I grew up playing the Telltale/Lucas Arts Series: Monkey Island. After discovering and playing those, I figured out that I have an infinite amount of love for Point and Click adventure games. After finishing that series, I really only played the other games made by either Lucas Arts or Telltale (Mostly because I thought they were the only creators of Point and Click games...until about a year ago, when I discovered there's an entire genre/world of Point and Click).  Of course, I must also note: The Curse of Monkey Island will always be my fav, as it was the first Point and Click I ever played. Ok...NOW...with all of that being said, I recently discovered WADJET EYE GAMES and I am SO happy I did. I would recommend EVERY.SINGLE,GAME they sell. I have played all of their MAC/iOS compatible Point and Clicks, and I have yet to be (even slightly) disappointed. I had very high expectations going in as the Monkey Island games, Day of the Tentacle, Full Throttle, Grim Fandago, etc. are some of the best games in the history of Point and Click; however, all of the games I have played from Wadjet Eye have been amazing. They have actually been so amazing that I can 100% say Wadjet Eye is at the top of my list, right there with the Telltale/Lucas Arts games. I 100% recommend purchasing and playing every game made by Wadjet Eye to anyone who likes (even those who kinda sorta like) Point and Click games.\n- [h1][b]★★★★☆[/b][/h1]\nSuper Time Force Ultra (STFU...) hits all the stereotypical tropes of an indie game. Fourth wall breaking humor, bright pastel colors, a synth soundtrack and of course retro graphics. Granted, this game came out in 2014, but today, frequent gamers might be sick of this. Despite that, the game certainly is still worth checking out. Behind the bad, immature humor lies a very apparant, unique and interesting game mechanic: the ability to rewind time and to run next to your former self.\n\nThe humor really turned me off the first time I booted this game up. It's too much in your face and it tries really hard to be funny. On top of that, it also tends to be really profane. There is a character that you can control that literally is a turd that has an ability to fart. One of the levels takes place within a sewer where you have to fight poop and ride it down pipes. Humor like this makes it feel like you're playing a game made by a 13 year old.\n\nThe gameplay, on ther other hand, is suprisingly refreshing and fun. Not only can you rewind time, you will also see your former selves run next to you and do the same damage as before. The whole game is build around this 'cloning' mechanic, as levels have to be finished within a certain time limit that can only be beaten with cooperation with yourself. For example, it can take forever to take a boss out by yourself, but by rewinding (to any moment you like) you can use more firepower to kill the boss faster. As you can imagine, this can create scenes where you fight of enemies along [i]many[/i] other characters you have controlled. It's the good kind of chaotic, as it never feels random to what happens in the game. My only real problem with it are the controls that don't always seem to registrate well. For instance, when you run of a slope, your character tend to be in the air just a couple of pixels high, which means it cannot jump. I ran off so many platforms because of this, but it is not a severe problem.\n\nThe game is not particulairy hard. You can rewind lots of times and by doing so, the level gets easier and easier. The dev also included a kind of trial mode, aside from the diverse story levels. Some of these levels are a little annoying, but ultimately I had fun with it in short sessions. The achievements are also not hard to unlock. It mostly involves collecting orbs and characters.\n\nFor the standard 13 bucks, this is not a bad deal! That is, if you go for all the achievements. When it is on sale, I would say this is a safe buy.\n- A fun game for drinking parties, take a shot every time you feel like you just wasted 19 cents.\n- This is a review about the port, not the game. The game itself is fantastic. I reference Moguri Mod throughout the review - this is a fan made mod that aims to improve the visual quality of the port.\n\nThe port is a lazy outdated mess:\n- It's lacking visual FX present in the original, such as the mist in the overworld of the Mist Continent. [b]This was fixed in a patch.[/b]\n- There is no way to restore the original font. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- Dialogue is rendered at a static pace, unlike the original. In the original game, lines of dialogue would show up on screen depending on how fast the character was talking. In this port, there is no distinction. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- There are multiple problems with the battle UI:\n-- It takes 40% of the screen. Square Enix patched this in the console versions, but the PC version was never patched. [b]This patch was released on PC in an update on the 6th of August 2020.[/b]\n-- It's rendered at what feels like 15fps, making navigation feel extremely clunky. In the original game, all menus were rendered at either 30fps interpolated or 60fps (don't know which one exactly), which made the browsing very fluid. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- All menus are clunky to browse because of the crippling low framerate. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- It's missing sound effects from the original. [u]This is not fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- Despite porting the game to Unity, Square couldn't be bothered to re-write the animation code to speed up battle animations independently of buff/debuff tick timers, arguably the original game's biggest problem.

[u]This is fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n- The backgrounds clash horribly with the new character models. [u]This is fixed by Moguri Mod.[/u]\n\nThe ONLY positive of this version is that you can skip the introduction to every battle. Except not really, because the option doesn't work half the time.\n\nThanks to the Moguri Mod, it is arguable that this version comes close to the original. Regardless of my opinion though, I'm not about to praise Square Enix for a port that the fans patched up. Moguri Mod is the only reason to buy this game on Steam.\n- Guys literally only want one thing and it's this.\n\npure JRPG nostalgia\n- [h1]Old, but has massive depth of content // Recommended for immersive role-players[/h1]\n\n+ Combat in general, and melee combat in particular, is very polished and open for an older title; everything can be controlled, such as directional blocking, without overcomplicating the mechanics involved\n+ Character creation is meticulously in-depth; initial backstory creation works seamlessly with selection of primary attributes in a way that makes the final product always feel refreshingly unique\n+ 'Story' is about as open-ended as can be, to the point where the game essentially has no story, and is something of a thirteenth century sand-box title; the player has complete, unadulterated freedom\n+ The game encourages the player to recruit and build a personal army as he/she progresses, and the mechanics put in place for doing so are well-rounded and complex\n+ Extremely easy and satisfying to mod; highly recommended\n+ Sorting and commanding one's troops is key, and the player would do well to benefit fromt he excellent command mechanics of the game; strategy is massively important and competently implemented\n+ Economics of the game add another layer of challenge to the game; trade and balancing one's income against one's expenses are both crucial elements to consider\n+ Multiplayer is fairly standard, run-of-the-mill stuff, but it's still densely populated and everything seems to connect well; the charm of the game, and its solid combat system, keep the players coming back in droves after more than five years\n\n- Politics, which are interesting and engaging in scope, end up being a somewhat weaker feature in practice, as NPCs are largely static during negotiations; this does break the immersion slightly, as it seems that your successes are based purely on stats, and not on the actual implications of one's choices\n- Quests often become tedious and repetitive\n- Tutorial is underwheling and largely insufficient to introduce the more in-depth mechanics that will be used outside of combat\n- Visuals are outdated and didn't stand well the test of time; even for the year of release, the textures and polygon counts are well below par\n\n[h1]LockeProposal's Big Day Out[/h1]\n\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/bigdayout#]Community Group[/url]\n[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/7611703/]Curator Page[/url]\n[url=https://www.reddit.com/r/SeriousSteamReviews/]Serious Steam Reviews subReddit[/url]\n- First off, just want to say this isn't a Metroidvania. This is a Zelda clone. And a good one!\n\nI bought this game because I heard it really put stress on you. You have limited time to complete the game and NPCs will begin dying if you aren't fast enough. Pretty crazy, right? Well, I do have a few gripes with that, but let me point out the good stuff first:\n+ Amazing combat. You have access to both guns and swords, but most of your damage will likely come from melee weapons since they have the ability to do an extremely-easy-to-pull-off PARRY! Parrying an enemy stuns it and gives your next attack against it a massive damage multiplier. All enemies, all bosses, and most projectiles are parryable, so this is what combat ends up revolving around. Even though I call it easy, you still get that cool feeling when you walk into an ambush and clear it without taking a hit, so it never gets dull as you go through the game.\n\n+ Good dungeon design. Since this game takes after Zelda, it's not shy about inserting a few puzzles into its dungeons. The overworld as well has quite a few surprising secrets and side quests that you won't be expecting when you play for the first time.\n\n+ Sequence breaks. This is mostly for New Game+ (or New Game Extra, a separate mode where you have access to major exploration items from the start, but not your whole endgame inventory), but it was interesting to find out how many secret paths and shortcuts there were, and how tightly they were managed. The devs thought of everything!\n\nSo now for the bad stuff.\n- Underwhelming story. Guess how much is really explained over the course of this story. If you guessed \"all of it\", you would be completely wrong and here's your dunce hat. Unsighted ends up spending so much of its time on the protagonist's relationships that it fails to answer several of the more important questions concerning the game's backstory. Why was there was a war? Who started it? Where are the humans now? Why are they so disorganized? Why do they seem to have no chain of command whatsoever? How did the automatons ever win anything at all at any point when they seem so extremely outclassed? I guess it doesn't matter. Look, there's two robot-girls kissing.\n\n- Fake pressure. I heard there was going to be pressure before I started the game, so I decided to go DEFCON 1 from the get-go and rush everything. I ended up completing the game in 10 in-game days and I felt pretty good about it. Zero NPC deaths! Zero! I'm a super awesome amazing hero, right? Well, credits roll and... the only achievement I get is the one for beating the game. No one really cares and apparently you're meant to play through multiple times anyway. So... why did I ever care? Why is this mechanic even in the game? All it did was make me shy away from general exploration and side quests since all of those things are less important than, ya know, saving the world. You can call that interesting, but when it has no payoff, it ends up being frustrating.\n\n- No post-game. Did I mention, if you bumrush the game and finish with just hours left on everyone's timers, you don't get to do any extra no-timer exploring afterwards? No, the game's over. Load the save and you get set back to where you were before fighting the final boss. If you want to do any actual exploring, that's what \"Explorer\" mode is for. You know, that mode that makes you feel like you're cheating?\n\nBasically, Unsighted is another game filled with missed opportunities. I recommend this game because the core gameplay and level design is very well done and very well executed, but you should probably know this before you start:\n\nThe only pressure here is the one you imagine. Since the game does nothing to acknowledge your successes, just play it at your own pace and don't be shy about using Explorer. Shame on the devs for hailing the agony of defeat, but not the thrill of victory.\n- Cook a fish; cook a pig; cook a chicken; cook anything you want. Now place a banana on your enemy's stove, and cook their ship. Culinary simulator with cool cosmetics.\n- User agreements are so scummy, I read them and I would sooner pirate this game than play it for free. IM GOING TO DO SOMETHING I CANNOT UNDO IF THIS SHIT DOENST STOP SOON.\n- Wow. Just wow. This is BY FAR the best visual novel i have played. the old school forums and cameras feel very detailed as whenever anything happens in a video chat, no matter how small, the characters react to it. the story was very enthralling and every time i slipped up and made a wrong move, my heart would feel as though it was gonna beat out of my chest. talking to violet felt very real and made the ending that i got so much more satisfying. the only bad things i can even say about this absolute masterpiece is just the fact that most of the really impact full options were locked because \"Emmett isn't cocky enough\" or  \"Emmett isn't compassionate enough\" which felt very vague and confining.\n\noverall the game is absolutely amazing and i wish the devs would come out with a game similar to this because of how good it was.\n9/10\n- Someone has to be the first, I guess.\n\nI don't know, I just didn't really feel too hooked on the game's premise. I feel less like I'm solving a puzzle and more like I'm hitting a pinata for all the clues. Every replay, I'm just going to have to do something whacky in order to get a new clue as to what might further my cause. And that doesn't really make me feel like I'm a part of a story, as much as a I feel like I'm going through an eternally looping monday, getting increasingly distanced to the world around me as I finally end up throwing myself overboard, because 'why not?'.\n\nI won't refund it, because I think the devs have poured a lot of heart into this game and I do think they deserve the money, but I couldn't really find too much entertainment in the game.\n- *puts on hipster cap* Well I have played this before, and let me tell you it is quite the experience.\n\nYume Nikki is a bare-bones surreal game created with RPGMaker. You play as a young girl (Madotsuki, according to the fandom) who refuses to step outside of her bedroom. Besides the dreadfully boring video games in her room, all she can do to entertain herself is to sleep, entering into her dream world. The \"goal\" of the game is to explore her dreams, collecting the various effects and bringing them back to the main nexus.\n\nLittle is known about the creator, and even less is known about the game's story. Yume Nikki lives very much by the philosophy of \"Show, Don't Tell\". There is no dialogue, music is limited to short sound bytes on loop, and the graphics look like something out of the 16-bit era. Despite all of this, Yume Nikki still managed to gather an almost cult-like following; the amount of fan work and theories created for Yume Nikki is truly astounding.\n\nPlenty of games try to capture the beauty and wonder of our dreams, but the reality is they can also be ugly and painful experiences, dredging up our deepest subconscious fears and desires. Yume Nikki refuses to shy away from the dark and the strange, understanding that this what gives our dreams meaning. Like any abstract art piece, it is impossible to place a singular meaning on anything in Yume Nikki. Everyone will interpret and relate to its events differently, and perhaps this is the crux of what let Yume Nikki gather its cult following.\n\nIts greatest strength is also its greatest weakness. The complete lack of direction is not exactly user friendly. This game does not hold your hand. There is no map, so the only way to figure out where to go is to get hopelessly lost many times as you explore the strange worlds behind each nexus door. It will be tempting to simply look up a guide, and I must admit I was guilty of watching a play-through myself for some parts. Indeed, completing the game without looking anything up is an achievement in itself.  However, the game was meant to be played, not watched. The joy (and sometimes terror) of discovery makes the experience worth experiencing. After you've given the game a proper playing, THEN you should look up all the stuff you inevitably missed. Cough cough [spoiler]Uboa[/spoiler] cough cough.\n\nWith that in mind, I humbly offer some advice to make your experience a bit more palatable. Feel free to ignore this if you wish to remain completely spoiler-free.\n\n1) Know the controls! They are not explained very well in the game.\n\nArrow keys: Movement\nZ: Accept; interact with objects (also Enter, Spacebar)\nX: Cancel; open the game menu (also C, V, B, N, Insert)\n1: Use an effect’s ability\n3: Cancel an effect’s ability\n5: Drop an effect on the ground (only in the Nexus)\n9: Pinch yourself to wake up and return to the real world. This one is especially important to remember, as sometimes you may find yourself in a dead-end zone leaving this as your only means of escape.\n\n2) Each time you wake up, make sure to use the desk In the real world to save your progress.\n\n3) Be thorough. Many of the dream worlds are expansive, with few landmarks. However, many of them also warp at each end, meaning if you walk in a straight line you will eventually return to where you started. You can use this to your advantage while mapping out the more expansive zones. Take note of interesting landmarks that you can use for future exploration. It might be helpful to keep some scratch paper handy if you have a bad memory like me.\n\n4) Interact with everything. If you see anything that looks strange or out of place, give it a poke. There are few enemies in the game, and nothing can actually kill you. Sometimes that creepy object might be the ticket to transport you into a new area. Also, try using different effects in different situations. You may find they have useful properties.\n\n5) Search for the bicycle effect first, it will make exploration much easier as it greatly increases your movement speed. You can find the bike effect in [spoiler]the zone behind the right door at the bottom-most side of the nexus[/spoiler]. I will leave locating it to you.\n\n\nWell, what are you waiting for? Give this game a try, you have nothing to lose! Except, maybe your sanity. Eh, you didn't really need that anyway.\n- Probaly the best game ive ever told people to hold back on\n\nIts fun, its rude, it's the best Southpark Game ever made, but its only a 10 to 14 hour game. Its a satisfying 10 hours mind you, i dont think i have played a game in recent memory good enough to hold me the way this game has, the atmosphere and envoriment just puts you right in a long southpark episode, and youll love every minute of it.\n\nSadly, there are not enough minutes of it for $59.99, and thats why i sadly don't recomend this excelent game.\n\nAnd to clarify, its 10 hours if you just take your time enjoying the story, its plausible to 100% this game in under 20 hours, and thats if you are in no hurry, with no game guide.\n- !!!!READ TO THE BOTTOM OR SCROLL!!!!\n       !!!!69 FREE PACKS + MORE CARDS AND COSMETICS CODES!!\n                        \n I did this for the NEW community:)         \n !!MAKE SURE TO UPVOTE AND OR AWARD SO EVERYONE NEW CAN SEE!!\n\ni have played almost all the MTG online iterations, MTG 2012 2013 2014, DUEL, MTGO, Magic the Gathering Online \nTactics, and now Arena. \nMTG 2012-2014 were fun but they were limited to the cards released those years\nMagic the Gathering Online was cool, you could trade and sell cards, do actual cube and draft with bought packs, but the interface was dated even after the update..\nMagic duels was sold to us as the end all, going forward no new program just duels and they would add sets as they released..(It wasn't, they didn't)\n\nMTG Arena (this one) has done everything they said and they did not abandon it after a few years. It may have just arrived on steam but it has been a beta then stand alone client for years (i was accepted into the beta 3/2018 and beta wrapped up 9/25/2019 to give an idea) They are releasing sets and keeping in line with standard releases, they offer a ton of formats and you can earn your cards and decks. i have earned thousands of cards and hundreds and hundreds of packs for free, 1-2 packs per day is easy, and yes it takes time but each month the ladder resets and you work your way up in ranked or you can just play another format or unranked to earn gold/xp,coins which translate into packs, save your gold for drafts and open packs and pick cards or just buy a ton of packs and earn them for free with exp! Also every 6 packs you open you get a choose your own blank rare gold wild card, and every 30 packs a mythic wildcard , also you get blank commons and uncommons in packs and by playing.  and PS there is a ton of people playing all the time, you never have to wait long for a match or even a draft to kick off.\n\n(New Account info and Instructions)\nNew Accounts have to play and complete 5 mini matches to unlock 12 free cards and 5 free starter decks, then upon completion you will enter into the client and see color challenges..skip that, click on the mail icon (top right) to claim 21 free packs (as of writing) from different recent sets, then click the home button (top right) to get out of the color challenge screen to the actual deck builder and match entry\n\nHere is a list of codes that will give you a ton of packs, cards and cosmetics, the packs, also count toward your free rare and mythic wildcard count you get by opening every 6 packs. by opening these you should have enough to craft your own starter decks and even pick quite a few blank rare mythic and common uncommon wild cards ( i just tried to make a new account and i got 69 free packs total that translated to 18 common 25 uncommon 12 rare and 4 mythic wildcards and a ton of actual rares mythics and hundreds of other cards (your mileage may vary depending on how many wildcards you find in the packs as well) \n\n(enter these in the store, top right \"redeem code\" field) \nIM SURE THERE ARE MORE CODES OUT THERE THESE ARE THE ONES I KNOW WORK IN 2023\nFree Booster Pack Codes ( 48 packs from these code alone for a total of 69 with the free mail claims at time of writing)\nPlayBRO\nPlayDMUAlchemy\nPlayDMU\nplayHBG\nPlayAlchemyNewCapenna\nPlaySNC\nPlayNEOAlchemy\nPlayNEO\nPlayVOW\nPlayMID\nPlayDND\nPlayKaldheim\nPlayZendikar\nPLAYM21\nPlayIkoria\nPlayTheros\n\nEXP CODES:\nThreads\t1,000 XP\n\nCOSMETIC CODES:\nFNMATHOME\nInformationIsPower\nCrimeIsAnArtForm\nAlwaysFinishTheJob\nFunIsntFree\nReadTheFinePrint\n:updated:\n\n*REMEMBER TO UPVOTE THIS POST AND SHARE WITH OTHERS, MORE PLAYERS THE BETTER:)*\n- \nWell, after almost a year of not playing this game, I must say, the devs did fix most of my issues. *Most*. Creative mode is fun, but you still need to collect stuff to make things, which is incredibly tedious. On top of that, the character dialogue is still really annoying and you need a NASA computer to play at a stable framerate, but hey, you can actually play without getting your ass beat. I'd like to up my ranking to an 8/10. Very fun, but I highly recommend playing with others. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOG REVIEW (outdated):\nThis game has potential, but unfortunately having fun with it is impossible if you aren't a hardcore survivalist.\n\nCritical Issue #1:\nThe main characters won't stop talking. Everytime you eat or hold the torch they say an unfunny one-liner that makes me want to gouge my eyes out with forks. Even Robin Ayou from Subnautica: Below Zero talked less, and the original game had a silent protaganist. Having characters that have constant dialogue that always repeats is just so annoying to the point where I had to turn off the volume. If the main characters were silent but atleast talked with each other, then I could see potential in that. But they just talk and talk and talk and none of it means anything.\n\nCritical Issue #2:\nThe enemies are way too hard to battle. To make better gear, you need to take on enemies that are so difficult to battle. Maybe you could say I'm just not good at battling enemies in survival games, but I was able to easily battle monsters in Terraria, Minecraft, Subnautica and Raft just fine. When your in-game monsters are too hard to defeat without gear that requires you to battle even MORE monsters, it is not fun, repetitive, and frustrating.\n\nCritical Issue #3:\nThe story is in the background. The fact that the story doesn't impact the game as much as it should is probably the worst aspect of any piece of media out there. The game sends you an a goose chase to find the  main story and it is infuriating. The story itself is all over the place. First it just seems like you need to make yourself grow bigger, but then it goes completely off the rails and into this scientist bunker with a robot that gives you quests, but you can ignore him and continue playing. I don't know if they finished the story, but so far it is not good.\n\nSomewhat Critical Issue:\nThere is no setting to dial back the graphics without lowering the resolution to look like Terraria. I can't see, and it is dumb and brings the whole beautiful vibe of being small down, ironically.\n\nMinor Issues:\nThe music is bland, and although I love electronic/synth music, this is just not it. The fact that you can't have bugs as pets or mounts, or even herd them is extremely upsetting. The farming sucks ass, it gives you 4 items of what you grew every 2 in-game days, when you can just find that item in more abundance at the place where it is located. Under the pond... JESUS CHRIST, the graphics are so bad. The wavy filter looks so bad, and you can see the entire underwater area crystal f**king clear, even though other smaller bodies of water have some kind of murkiness to it. Minor issues like this hold back the game.\n\nAlthough this is still in early access, it feels as if they wasted a lot of potential already. For such a unique world and concept, it never really exploits the amazing and obvious things that it can accomplish. Why not grow your own personal army of ants? Oh sorry, you can pick up eggs but they hatch and they aren't friendly. Why not create a raft made of weed stems and lilypads? Oh sorry, you can just build a base that looks like a boat. Although there are much worse steam games out there, and ones that I have hated more than this, this was sort of a slap to the face. It's not god-awful, and there are a lot of good things about it like the cartoony bug designs and the beautiful graphics, but honestly, it's a 6/10 bordering on a 7, and although many others have enjoyed this, being the super critical demogorgon that I am, this didn't exactly \"ground\" me.\n- I came across Dreamscaper after playing 200 hours of Hades. I was looking for similar games that could recapture some of the magic of discovery and progression that made Hades such a delightful experience.\n\nDreamscaper is not Hades. There probably isn't any game that can measure up to the experience of playing Hades, and there probably won't be for a long while. But a lot of the same elements are there, and I did really enjoy Dreamscaper for what it was.\n\nThe \"story\" in Dreamscaper is more of a personal journey. There aren't really \"events occurring\" so much as a character working through her issues. The supporting characters are fairly interesting, though not quite on par with the literally larger-than-life dynamic personalities of Hades. But to be fair, the characters in Dreamscaper are ordinary folks, not mythological deities.\n\nThe overall atmosphere of the game is \"nostalgic.\" It's an exploration of the protagonist's childhood memories, so that makes sense. There is a very different energy here than Hades' cheeky and horny angst. It's more sad and calm.\n\nIn terms of the feel of playing the game, Dreamscaper has a lot of similarities to Hades. There is a varied arsenal of different weapons and abilities, progression through randomized levels with boss fights, a wide selection of permanent character upgrades to purchase using resources gathered during runs, a relationship system to grow closer with the characters, etc. Unlike Hades, every aspect of your loadout can change throughout a run: you can swap out weapons and abilities as you encounter new and better ones along the way. It's both more flexible than Hades and less; you're not locked in to one weapon for the entire run, and there are many more weapons and abilities (and combinations thereof); but with more randomness comes less control, so it's a lot harder to craft and hone a particular build in Dreamscaper than in Hades. A lot of the \"builds\" are elemental damage modifiers, in which all you're trying to do is find a bunch of gear that (say) deals Lightning damage or increases your Lightning damage dealt. The upgrades are largely \"number get bigger,\" and while it can be satisfying to get a bunch of cool multipliers, it does feel less \"combo\"y or \"breakable\" than Hades (though there are certainly some very powerful and broken-feeling builds you can end up with).\n\nThe gameplay is challenging, like Hades, though perhaps slightly less. Like Hades, a lot of your ability to clear rooms and defeat bosses effectively comes from learning their attack patterns and timings. I do wish there were more variety to the enemies, as many of them are just \"the guy from the last level but he is stronger and has more abilities now\" (though that criticism applies to Hades as well). The boss fights are by and large much easier once you learn their patterns, though there are still a few that can be tough for certain builds. The \"hard version\" of bosses are definitely a force to be reckoned with, though.\n\nThe art and music are attractive and inviting. It's much more The Sims than Guilty Gear, but in a way that fits the atmosphere nicely. It's stylized in a very different way than Hades, but it works in its own way.\n\nThe developers are also very community-oriented and are responsive to community input through their Discord. The Hades developers probably are too, but I have no direct experience interacting with them.\n\nSo in conclusion, if you liked Hades because of its horny angst, badass metal riffs, mythological themes, and bloody humor, you may not have much interest in Dreamscaper. But if you liked Hades because of its randomized runs, variety of weapons and builds, feeling of progression, challenging boss fights, and dynamic cast of characters with complicated relationships, then you should absolutely pick up Dreamscaper. And if you didn't like Hades, then you probably stopped reading this review after the first paragraph.\n- Their last privacy agreement update (January 1st, 2021) states they will \"sell\" users information, including name, email and billing address to third party companies (including social media and advertising). There is no other way of playing the game without accepting those terms, very sad practices for a paid game really.\n- The weakest RE since RE6. \n\nFeels half baked as heck on a game design level. Too many damn cutscenes and areas where you're just on rails. Really, the game design seems to take a massive step back from RE7 and even a bigger step back in terms of puzzles. Really a shame.\n\nNot to mention the performance is pretty terrible and inconsistent. Not to mention the lack of full keyboard bindings and support. Really, this port feels like a whole afterthought to a game that already feels like an afterthought.\n\nIt does get better on the back end but not enough to balance out that weak front end.\n- Open world exploration by design, pants soiling horror by incident. Blends the concepts of innate human fear of deep water and unknown danger with constant, all pervading curiosity.\n\nYou have to dive deeper. You have to know what's down there.\n- I read the negative reviews and backlash against DoubleFine, but I thought that I would be OK even if the game had some bugs and wasn't quite finished, so I picked it up anyway. That was a mistake.\n\nThe game is not just unfinished, its in an Alpha state. Which is sad, because I definetly would enjoy the game if it was done. As it is, the game is entertaining for a couple hours, then quickly grows tiresome and frustrating. The bugs are not crippling, but taken as a whole they represent a game that is very unbalanced and grates on you over time. \n\nIf DF-9 ever hits the $5 pile, pick it up. otherwise pass.\n- [h1] Overview [/h1]\nThis is going to be a really long review, so I'm just going to start off with an overview of the whole game. For, one I really enjoyed playing it because of its unique playstyle and interesting storyline. This game kept me engaged the whole time and even though I finished the main storyline, I feel like there is sitll more for me to do. And one last thing, I won't be reviewing Multiplayer here, since I haven't played multiplayer yet.\n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\nThe storyline is definitely a strong point of this game. Rather than giving you evrything from the start, you get thrown into an unknown world with little known about the end of the game and the path that leads to it. You find out more progressively as you search and discover ruins to find ancient relics that give more clues about the past. However, you don't have to explore each area to its fullest potential the first time you enter the game, you can also come back to areas with fast travel (except for at the very end towards the conclusion of the game). The tombs you can raid are also kind of like side quests and the relics that you can find, both inside the tombs and around the map give you insight into the area and the main story. There are also several cut scenes that add onto the story and I thought the experience was a lot more directed than a game such as Skyrim, but it still provides a large amount of freedom.\n\n[h1]Level Design/Graphics [/h1]\nSpeaking of freedom and your ability to enjoy the world around you, I feel like this feeds perfectly into another aspect of the game. One of the most important parts of the modern game is the graphics engine with which it runs, as well as how it is exploited to provide the best experience. Though this Tomb Raider is undoubtedly older than what one would consider modern, I still find that it does a good job with shaders and keeping the world immersive. And though the textures, normals maps, and hair physics may not be the best I have ever seen, they are still very good. The cinematic cutscenes feel actually cinematic and everything seems to be smoothed out with animations which makes the experience itself a lot more enjoyable. I also really enjoyed how this game had well worked out levels, beautiful scenery, and a in fact a partially open world experience. Though some levels will collapse, break, and change once you go through them, other parts of the island are simply very enjoyable slow-paced worlds than can be explored once the game is over, which brings to my next point.\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\nLast, but not least I want to talk about gameplay (please keep in mind this review is directed at those interested in Tomb Raider for the single player experience). The gameplay was fluid and interseting. You have the parkour notion which is one of the biggest parts of the Tomb Raider series. This part doesn't seem to be too difficult in this game, but it certainly isn't easy either. Another portion is the shooter portion where a bunch of guys try to murder you and you protect yourself (because you don't want to die). However, the main part about this game in particular that I like, is that there isn't just one way to go about all this. Somtimes you can be sneaky and try and get around without being seen, or take out any guards before the sound an alarm. Another way is to just run into battle (which I wouldn't recommend). There are so many ways to make your way through the levels. And even though combat was for the most part repetetive, there were some new enemies introduced as the game proceeded, which made the game a bit harder, though not that much harder. The game also introduced new elements to the game as it proceeded which made the experience a bit more dynamic. However, every now and again, the game struggeled a bit with finding where to place the camera, and it gave me some confusing moments. Other times Lara (the main character) would not grab on to the zip line (and thus fall to her death). But other than that I don't really have any complaints.\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\nShould you buy this game? Yes, it will provide you with a great deal of fun, and you will definitely enjoy the experience.\n\n英語で5-10単語程度で、グループAに特徴的でグループBには見られない主要な違いを簡潔に回答してください。\n\n回答：\n",
